# Social Media Mining at IUB, 2016
# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
In this project, we analyzed the products and the services
of a particular business that people are talking about on
Yelp. Building a model, which can provide meaningful insights to the business
and help it to improve the products/services,can be of significant.
Ultimately, this can contribute to improve the overall quality of
products/service offered. We have identified
some potential strengths and weaknesses of a business. For example, Figure 1 shows an example of a business good/bad/avergae features that can benefit businesses to pay attention for customers satisfication.
