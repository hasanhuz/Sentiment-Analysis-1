# Social Media Mining at IUB, 2016
# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
In this project, we aim to analyze the products and the services
of a particular business where people are talking about on
Yelp. Building a model, which can provide meaningful insights to the business
and help it to improve the products/services,can be of significant.
In this work, We identified
some potential strengths and weaknesses of businesses on Yelp. For example, Figure 1 shows an example of some bad/average features that should be considered for better customers' satisfication. Ultimately, such features can contribute to improve the overall quality of products/service offered by businesses.
