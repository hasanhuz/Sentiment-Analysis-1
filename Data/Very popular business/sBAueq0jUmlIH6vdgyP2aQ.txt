4	The sister restaurant to The Egg and I located on Sahara Blvd, but don't expect to see the exact same menu.  We jump back and forth between the two restaurants depending on what we feel like eating that day.  Fairly standard breakfast combinations of eggs breads and assorted meats, so it's hard to go wrong with the food, but the definite favorite for me is their Banana Nut bread which is fresh made at the restaurant and always served piping hot.The service is excellent, with a lot of the same faces being there for a while now.  Highly recommended for breakfast.
4	Best breakfast that I have found in Vegas.  The blueberry pancakes are to die for!  Even their coffee is good.  We have never had bad food and have been pleased with everything we've ordered.Servings are substantial and the service is usually very good.  This place is always busy, so you do have to be patient.
5	The banana nut muffins are worth the trip alone.  I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great. Overall, nice atmosphere, friendly service, and great food with generous portions.  Will definitely go back to try some other pancake combinations.
4	Taking advantage of weekend brunch options, the BF was craving cincy chili from The Egg Works.  We've seen advertisements for a second location soon to open, and realized they were the sister restaurant of The Egg & I.We walked in around 1:30 pm and the place was pretty full.  We were seated with only a minimal wait and newspaper menus were presented.  I was immediately drawn to the Corn Beef Hash (Corn beef hash grilled then topped with two eggs any style.  Served with Works potatoes and toast or a banana nut muffin. $9.25) although I also wanted a skillet too.The BF was pretty set on getting their cincy chili, but I was able to convince him to get their Chili Skillet Works (Start with a layer of Work's potatoes, then pile on the ingredients, top with a mixture of cheddar and jack cheese and your choice of two eggs any style.  Served with a fruit garnish and a choice of toast or a banana nut muffin.  Your choice of Works chili or cincy chili and diced onion.) for $7.95 instead.  This combined the best of both worlds - a skillet and the ever famous cincy chili!He also ordered one of their bottomless flavored coffees for $2.25.When our orders arrived, I was more than impressed.  They definitely give you hearty portions!  My corn beef looked like the whole can was under my two sunny side up eggs!  But the real winner of the day was the BF's chili skillet!  Oozing with cheese in all directions and full of flavor, I couldn't help but dig into his meal instead!  Service was good - the waitresses were pleasant and friendly and the busboys are quick with cleanup.  They definitely have a system here and it works.  People work as a team and it definitely makes them more efficient.They have a bunch of other typical breakfast items to choose from as well, and what looked like a huge tostada salad.  We'll definitely be going back for more brunch meals here!(Pics of our brunch are posted!)
5	Yes, another fine breakfast joint that is very reasonable, friendly service, and great food.  Came here today after an all-night bender on the Strip.  Their special was the "Heart Stopper" Skillet, with choice of egg, toast, and sausages and potatoes topped with country gravy.  Even on a Monday, the place is packed with locals.  This is a great place if you want to get away from the high prices on the Las Vegas Strip for breakfast.  Another treat that you will enjoy is the Banana Nut Muffin.  It was well worth the trip to the West Side.  I will be returning to this fine breakfast eatery.
5	With so many choices for breakfast, what makes one place stand out from the others? Well, Egg Works (http://www.theeggworks.com/) has a a little something special up its sleeve. Its not the only place that does this, but it definitely a nice change of pace. What is it you ask? Banana nut bread as a toast option! If you didnt get excited by the last sentence, you've got issues! =). On my daily trek to work, I always pass by a mom and pops breakfast place called The Egg and I. Egg Works is by the same people and its closer to my house. We head out on a Sunday morning around 10am and this place is packed. After a minimal wait, we sit down and open the extensive menu. Its one of those menus where you find something you want on every page. After about 15 minutes we finally agree on two dishes. We order the Bacon Avocado Omelette and the Country Fried Steak and eggs. Oh yeah... This is my favorite part. "What kind of toast would you like with your meal? We've got wheat, white, sourdough, banana nut." OMG. Nothing makes a yummy breakfast more yummy than a banana nut muffin that doesnt cost extra! Haha.
3	I went to this place after seeing the great reviews and I think my hopes were too high.  It wasn't crowded at all which was nice, but for some reason the hostess decided to put a very old and very rowdy party of four next to us.  They were talking about vomiting and gagging and how ham makes them swell up.  My husband and I just looked at each other.  I looked arond the restaurant at all the empty seats and I couldn't believe that they sat them down next to us.....anyway, on to the food.....it was just ok...I had a veggie omelet with the potatoes which were very, very salty....it wasn't horrible, but not the best breakfast I've ever had..
5	If it weren't for yelp I think we would have been stuck at a crappy breakfast buffet. This place was perfect!!!! It was a breakfast person's heaven. The menu was just enormous and I couldn't decide between the prime rib benny and the ultimate omelet but I picked the prime rib benny which was served with seasoned potatoes and it was served on a croissant with eggs, onions, peppers and hollidaise. I also got to taste the banana nut muffin with lived up to the yelp hype. Service here was top notch even though it was packed completely. I would say the only complaint was that the hostess was not a great communicator and I had to ask a few times to figure out when we were gonna be seated...that was minor, please come try it.
3	Everything was good,  but the toast was cold and service sucked!
5	OK folks, this is the essential breakfast joint...just look at the name!  Upon arrival, I could already tell this was the real deal Holyfield...it was packed with a good amount of people waiting.  I grabbed a seat at the counter, bypassing everybody (really dislike waiting in line for anything)  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, eggs over medium, seasoned potatoes, sourdough toast.  I would suggest the potatoes w/o seasoning ( a bit salty) the steak was good, texture, crispy, good gravy.  Add Lea n Perrins and we are ready to rock!Service is good here overall, this is a busy place w/ a good system for order caller/plater and waitress/runners.  After all was conquered, the waitress tells me about the banana nut muffins.... she gave me one after the fact to try it.  I'm not a big sweets guy, but it waas good.This place has something for everyone and stuff for other people....for the low star reviewers, I'd say they are the others... for the masses, this should be a 5-star place!  Til next time, good eating!
3	Late brunch the past Sunday and we brought a friend whose never experienced the egg wonders of Las Vegas's breakfasts.  (He's usually fast asleep after the graveyard shift!)He chose the Beef Eater "Grilled Parmesan sourdough, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and grilled roast beef and a side of horseradish sauce."  I'm not sure if they are still using horseradish sauce, but my friend thought it was hollandaise sauce!  I tried a bit and found it 'interesting.'  The sandwich was decent as he finished it all, and the Works potatoes was a generous portion because he had a lot leftover.The Husband was craving the Country Fried Steak "A hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with Grandma's country gravy and served with two eggs, Works potatoes and a choice of toast or banana nut muffin."  He has his two eggs over easy with sourdough bread.  The country gravy was definitely creamy, but needed a bit more zip.I wanted a side of corn beef hash, and the waitress said they could definitely do that.  She asked if I wanted the homemade version or the canned, which I had never been asked before.  Apparently they just started doing the homemade version, but most people prefer the canned one instead.  Feeling the need to experiment, I went with the homemade version, knowing ahead that it was going to be more stringy-like.  And she also asked if I wanted it more well-done, which I took as "crispier."  They also serve it as a small or large side order.  The homemade version is definitely a bit more stringier and something I've had quite often since most Filipinos eat their corned beef like that.  However, it definitely needed a bit more flavor - some heat and pepper took care of that!Overall, our breakfast experience this time was okay.  Our friend wasn't as impressed, and just found it to be average.  We weren't wowed the same way as the first time.(Pics posted!)
4	The banana nut muffin thing is the best.  My hubby orders a skillet most every time, and I get the eggs benedict.  The food is always very good, as is the service.  The coffee is weak and the water tastes funny.  Also, the atmosphere is better at the Sahara location.  We will continue to visit both locations.
5	I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I have experienced them in both a dine in and take out situation. When I went in for take out, they sat me down and gave me a drink while I waited. Everyone was very friendly. The food came out in no time at all. I brought the food back to work and proceeded to devour my meal. The second experience I had was even better. After we sat down, our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was also very friendly. After this, two other people stopped by to be sure that we had placed our drink order. Then we ordered our food and I requested the last portion be a to-go order. The waitress remembered and at the end of the meal when she gave us the check she put the order in and it was ready right before we were ready to go. Now for the specifics.... their eggs are really as fantastic as they say. My favorite so far is the Cincinnati Chili. If you have EVER had Cinci Chili before and loved it, this is a MUST try. I'm not sure how many places have this in Vegas...  I tried the Cinci burrito. The egg in it was extremely filling and the entire thing got eaten (in twi sittings).If you're looking for a decent priced breakfast/lunch joint - try this place out. I think you will be very happy you did.
4	Breakfast eaters, look to other reviews because someone's Best Burgers of Las Vegas list pointed the way here, specifying the cheeseburger with Cincy chili, and that's the find. The burger itself is fine, indifferent, no worse than a thousand others of its ilk. But the chili. These folks get the Cincinnati approach. Tweaked with unsweetened chocolate and a bit of cinnamon (but replete with more standard fare like cumin, paprika, garlic and tomato sauce) it's a regional style that if you suspend any constitutionally held ideas of what chili ought to be, is really quite delightful. In Ohio (and across the river in Kentucky) you can have it 3-Way, 4-Way or 5-Way with spaghetti and the chili being the one and two base and finely grated Cheddar, onions and beans being three through five, depending on how you like it. Works the same here at Egg Works. This stuff is hard to come by out west, (a few years ago some guy tried to open a Skyline imitation buried in a shopfront hole in the wall on Van Nuys Blvd and folded in flash) and if you're curious to open your mind and palate to chili adventures, this is way easier than flying into CVG. That said, here's a caution for all cases: don't go anywhere expecting the absolutely uncontested best thing you've ever eaten. Take it for what it is, simple, enjoyable and somewhat different from what you're probably used to and your experience (and life) will be just a tiny bit more pleasant. Enjoy.
3	Food is served in GIGANTIC portions, staff was very attentive. Food is ok, dont think I'd eat here again though, its way off the strip.
4	This place is called Egg Works, so you come here for the eggs. Screw the sandwiches and no egg dishes. All I do know is that the mushroom and cheese omelet is the best I have ever had. The "Three Pigs" omelet is amazing too. This is saying alot given then I am not a breakfast person and would skip it on a daily basis. I have also had the California Crepe. It is alright. Nothing spectacular. Now for the sides. Almost all the egg dishes comes with potatoes which really suck. Yes, I will eat a couple of pieces but I typically give it to someone else. Another side is the banana nut muffin. It looks very unappetizing, but it isn't bad. Imagine a flat top muffin that looks like someone was tilting the muffin tray as it was cooking.The service is typical diner. Nothing fancy or special.
3	decent breakfast place.  i like the 'happy face, sad face' egg that signifies you need service.  caution, though - if you show the sad face egg, the waitress gets a bid sad-faced, herself.i'm not a huge fan of the newspaper menu - seems wasteful.  also, the fruit plate could use more berries and less melon, but i do like that they give you a whole pitcher of coffee.definitely someplace i continue to go, but there's other bfast places in town i enjoy more.
4	I would give this place 5 stars except for the potatoes, very boring. Otherwise the omelets are da bomb. I really love the chicken enchilada one with the yummy red sauce, tortillas and green chiles, as good as it gets. And don't miss out on the house specialty, banana nut muffins to die for, I could probably eat half a dozen of them! They also appear to have killer burgers too. Will have to try one for lunch next time. Our server was nice and helpful.  This area is really nice in Vegas too, not too far from Red Rock so its a nice leisurely drive to get there.
4	came here and had the corned beef hash and eggs.  the banana muffin that it came with was really good.  service was good and the food came out very promptly.  everyone i ate with enjoyed their food and we all ordered different things.  they had a couple big screen tv's with espn on which is a great touch for sports fans.  i would definitely come here again
3	The only thing I want to get at this place over and over again is the wonderfully baked carrot muffin top. It comes complimentary with your meal. WOW. It's delicious.The main dish is just ok on the other hand. Nothing to grossly out of place, but just not spectacular. I got the chorizo burrito-one of the specials of the morning. Too much chorizo..it made the whole burrito taste too salty. I would've mixed in a little less meat and more fresh ingredients than it would have been banging.The side potatoes were not bad. Would give it another try..
5	I love this place! The Cabo Burrito is AMAZING... Fresh fruit is awesome as a substitute for potatoes, but if you do get the potatoes ask for light seasoning...
5	My favorite Sunday spot.  I have never had a bad experience with the service or food.  I would recommend a skillet or the sundance omlette (yuMmm!)
4	I don't eat breakfast all the time but this is one of the few breakfast places that I like. The portions are big and service is great. The barn-like decor, with some farm animals, and egg people on the walls are real cute. The menu is presented different, it's printed on a newspaper type layout and there are little egg people all over that too. Cute.My regular meal of choice: the waffles and sausage patties with an iced tea (fresh brewed). My husband usually gets an omelet (egg whites) and potatoes. I love the waffles, you get 1 large waffle, light and sweet. The Patties are good too. And there's always enough potatoes on my husband's plate, that I'm able to have some too. I like them because they've some kind of Cajun seasoning on them. If you need anything from the server, there's an egg shaped sign on the table and if you need assistance, you flip the black egg over so that the yellow egg is showing and a majority of the time, a server instantly shows up to assist you, whether they're your server or not. It's interesting, and I hope I don't jinx myself by saying this, but we've been going there for about 3 years or so, maybe once every couple months, and there has not been a time when the service was bad for us. The only thing that I'm not a fan of, is the long wait that you have to deal with sometimes, especially on a Sun or Sat and the parking is poop when it's busy. Yes, I'd go back and we do quite often.
4	My friend had heard about this place from watching the Food Network/Travel Channel, so we tried it out when we were in Vegas a few weeks ago.  We went for breakfast and the food was great!  I had the Sundance special omelette (which has a lot of different veggies and cheese, no meat, and came with the banana nut bran muffin,  super yum!).  My friends tried the french toast, the prime rib skillet and the eggs with grits.  The portions are pretty generous and all the food we ordered was good.  One thing that we liked was that you can flip the egg sign (which is placed on the table), instead of trying to flag down a waiter.  They'll come once they see the unhappy egg sign.  Pretty cool!
3	I heard about this place while researching the best places to go for breakfast in Vegas on Yelp, of course. =D Checked out the website and was impressed that it was on one of Rachel Ray's finds on the Food Network. Looking at the menu made me hungry so my husband and I decided to check it out the next day.It was quite busy when we got there around 9:30 am. Plenty of tables and flat screen tvs...We were immediately seated. I was fascinated with the newspaper-printed menu. Quite unusual. Definitely stood out.I ordered the Waffle Works with bananas, eggs and bacon. My husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. When our orders arrived the first thing we noticed was that the portions were HUGE! To us, one plate was plenty for two.I was a  bit disappointed with my order. Nothing really impressed me besides the portion. My waffles were overcooked. The eggs didn't have enough seasoning and tasted rubbery. The bacon was okay.My husband said that his biscuits were a bit hard to fork through. But, he enjoyed the Works potatoes. Overall our first experience at Egg Works was (sorry to say): Eh.The Standouts: Hearty portions, attentive service, unique menu.Would we come back? Yes. Willing to give it another visit. Next time we'll share a plate and try out the banana nut muffin.
4	My long overdue review for Eggworks has arrived! You can never go wrong at this breakfast dive. Every item is piquant and pleasingly tasteful! Enticing items that I have enjoyed are:The SUNDANCE SPECIAL is a delicious veggie omelette with spinach, sliced mushrooms,and artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special EGG Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. If I am feeling like an extra heavy filling in my stomach for breakfast, adding the seasoned chicken or blackened chicken will just do it right! VEGETARIAN CREPE is a layer of guacamole, mushrooms, fresh spinach and Swiss cheese. It is served with the Works poppy seed dressing, which is so delightful.COUNTRY FRIED STEAK is a hand battered chicken fried steak, topped with a southern Grandma's country gravy and I have no problem with drinking this gravy as if it was soup. SEASONED CENTER CUT NEW YORK STEAK is a succulent 6 oz. Char-broiled steak with two eggs at your style of choice. All breakfast items are served with the WORKS potatoes, which is well-seasoned and I just can't get enough of it.  You also have a choice of toast, english muffin or banana nut muffin. I favor the sweet taste of the banana nut muffin because it is palatable at the end of my  meal.Although there is always a wait for a table, the waiting time has a good cycle since all of the staff are great at getting the orders in and out at a consistent fast pace.
4	Very good and fast seating! Me and a friend couldn't stop talking how good the food was while we were eatting it! I usually can finish a big meal but this one was very hard and I failed. That is a good fail though because they gave you a lot for a good price!
5	Best breakfast ever. This place totally surpassed my expectations.  Just a quick google search and we were off the strip and a few (7) miles later we're at Eggworks.  This place is cute, it feels like you're in a log cabin.  The staff is super prompt. Whenever you needed your waitress, you flip this metal egg at your table from a smiley egg to a frowny egg and someone comes running!But more importantly, the price, and the food. I think the costs were reasonable.  I believe I ordered an eggwhite veggie omelette (came with a side of fruit and banana nut muffin/hash or potatoes). I opted for the muffin (splendid!!!). I also ordered a side of the turkey sausage (pumped they even had turkey sausage), an apple danish, hot tea, cranberry juice....and i think that's it, lol.  I did take the pastries to go, so dont judge me too much.all the food was great. the table came with a variety of hot sauce (which is a must for me). i recommend the good ole Cholula.  They had something they must make called Habla Diablo or something (see my pics) which was just plain heat. Didnt care for it.  The fruit was delicious. Every piece was excellent, and I'm pretty picky about fruit.  Eggs were great, just enough cheese on top.  My only complaint was that the tomato in the omelette made it wetter than i'd prefer.  I really dont need to write anymore since i loved every bite. My peeps got the potatoes which were also great.  I think for my entire order it was $25, tops.  Totally worth it considering I ordered so much!DEFINITELY GO HERE. Especially if you love breakfast.
3	This was my second time at Egg Works. The wait on a Sunday  at noon wasn't too long...about 10-15 minutes. This time I wanted to try the Homemade Corned Beef and my food partner decided on the Country Fried Steak. With each entree, you can get toast or banana nut muffin. I was pleased with the banana nut muffin. When our entrees came, I was disappointed with the Corned Beef. It was dry and just not what I expected. It basically looked like the corned beef you get out of a can. The Country Fried Steak was good, but not blow your mind out of this world great. We ordered a large pancake on the side, but it was a bit rubbery too me and over buttery. However, the service was great.  Overall, it was worth it with our 2 for 1 coupon and for a close breakfast place to eat its convenient.
5	Love, Love, Love this place!!!  I've lived down the street from this place for a year and never went, until May 6th.My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary breakfast (couldn't make it out to dinner together that night) and loved the entire thing!I had:-Fresh Veggie Omelet, with the house potatoes & banana nut muffin.You can chose either the banana nut muffin or toast- go with the muffin!  The portions are quite large, but you can order a half order- awesome!They have a couple different kinds of coffee- Regular or Hazlenut and they have a get variety of creamers for you to use.I am now craving this place like CRAZY.  So good and so fast!  During the week- it was no problem getting a table.  On the weekend- crazy line out front.
4	Was feeling hungry after I got off work late last night / early this morning...  friend and I decided to try this place out.  It's right around the corner from his house but he'd never even heard of it.  We got there around 7:30am and there was a decent crowd there...  about a half hour later there was a line of people waiting.  Guess we had good timing!I went with the chili skillet...  it was delicious...  It came with their potatoes on the bottom, with some slightly spicy chili, a good bit of melted cheese, and two eggs on top.  Definitely would recommend this one.  Perfect portion size and with a nice sweet slice of pineapple on the side of the plate.  My buddy went with the Denver Omelet...  Iooked great... nice and big (4 egg), well-filled.  He ate the whole thing so it must have been good!  He wasn't a big fan of the potatoes...  Their potatoes are the small rectangular/squarish ones....  kinda heavily seasoned.  He and I both prefer a more traditional hash brown.  Not sure if they're available though.  My skillet had the potatoes.... which were really good with chili and cheese on them... but as a side dish I wouldn't have been crazy about them.Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  They have to be to keep the crowd moving!  Would definitely go back... and would probably get the same thing.  Just don't try going much after 7:30am on a Sunday though, unless waiting in lines is your thing.
4	I went here with a friend about a month ago and it was so delicious.  I love all of the different omelette options.  Because i LOVE salt and i don't eat meat (not unless it is suspicious meat) i ordered spam and rice.  Yum.  how do you go wrong?  i just love that they offer spam!!  My friend ordered the chile relleno omelette.  I didn't even know that such a masterpiece existed.  It was savory, cheesey, and had a yummy kick that only a chile rellano can deliver.  I'd love to go here again in the future... though i'm always in Vegas, not sure when the next time i'll venture "off-strip".
4	You'll rarely find me reviewing breakfast places, as my body has a tendency to not turn on my appetite until I've already been awake for two or three hours.  So coming from me, a four star review of a breakfast place is a great thing.  Egg Works helped me get my breakfast fix that I've been craving for the past week.  I have dined here before, but I saw Jen S. post his review of this place this past Friday, and that helped me decide where to get breakfast!So on those rare occasions when I do breakfast, I love me some eggs benedict.  So I decided to love me some eggs benedict through Egg Works' "Works Veggie Benny," which their menu describes as, "English muffin grilled brown, topped with grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, sliced avocado,two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, sauce then we serve it with a side of Works potatoes."  First things first: the Works potatoes are amazing.  I will eat potatoes in any form, whether it be baked or mashed or anything in between, and the Works potatoes are at the top of my list.  They are crispy on the outside but maintain that starchy softness inside, and are served with a salt/spice seasoning that make these taters into little breakfast fries.The Works Veggie Benny itself was good.  The avocado and tomato sounded delicious and refreshing, but was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  I think one of the poached eggs "popped" prematurely and got yolk mixed in with the hollandaise, leading to a soupy consistency that smothered my veggies.  Not a bad thing, but I wasn't used to my hollandaise being so runny.  Outside of that, the food was delicious, though I think next time I'll be going with a Benny that has some bacon or sausage to go with that sauce.  The meal also came with a slice of watermelon and honey dew; fruit is always a pleasant way to round out your breakfast.My friend got the Spinach Benny, and we both got coffee, which led to a bill of $25 for the both of us.  Each entree was just under $10, with the coffee being about $2.50 or so.  I am definitely coming back here again, I just can't guarantee when!  Once I try some of their skillets, scrambles, omelets (they have quite the menu!) I have no doubt that my four stars will be bumped to five.
4	This place is always crowded. There is always a line when I come here , especially on the weekends. One of the best skillet breakfasts I have ever had. I had the "Works" skillet breakfast. The potatoes were very crisp and everything works well together. The flavor was awesome. I also had the spinach Benny! Very flavorful hollandaise sauce.  Service was great.  I will be back.They have great bloody Mary drinks.
4	This is a great start to anyone's morning. I will forewarn you all, this place can get packed and you might be waiting a few mins to be seated. I am pretty basic, and I just get the eggs scrambled, with two slices of bacon, and their seasoned potatoes (which are great!). I also get their banana muffin. It is the BEST! I sometimes order one to eat at Egg Works, and two to go. I one time ordered four to go. That is how great these muffins are!Service is pretty good. Just turn over this egg ornament on the table, and someone is there to wait on you within two-five mins.
5	Yummy yum yum! Great for breakfast and their fries for lunch are delicious. Love the coffee too. The potatoes here are very addicting. My hubby and I have to restrict ourselves or we find ourselves coming here quite a bit. Not for those on diets.
4	Ill admit it, Im easy....on breakfast places.  In my opinion, producing good solid breakfasts isnt exactly rocket science so most places that specialize in it usually get a pretty good ranking from me.  Even with my modest expectations, my visit to Egg Works was a pleasant surprise. The menu was varied, the portions generous and the service crisp.  After just getting destroyed by some octogenarians at the 9am bingo session, I decided I need to assuage my wounds in some eggs and potatoes.  I had been meaning to try Egg Works so after inviting my mom to come with me (hey someones got to pay after the drubbing I took) we entered the surprisingly rustic and charming restaurant for a late breakfast,  My mom instantly loved the bucolic decorations and I loved the big plasma tv's playing the World Cup games.  Distractions aside, we both commented on the wonderfully large menu and were impressed to even see ethnic Hawaiian and Mexican options.   I opted for the Sunrise Special which was essentially a greek omelet with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  Accompanying the omelet was breakfast potatoes and my choice of their famous banana nut muffins or toast.  Wanting to kick it a tad more old school (with the bingo I was certainly kicking it old, old, old school), I opted for the toast.  Mom had the eggs benedict which she found to be exactly what the doc ordered.  As for my omelet, it was perfectly fluffy with the right balance of filling.  The potatoes were seasoned and plentiful however, they looked to be frozen and not freshly made.  I love fresh homefries and this was a slight disappointment.  Otherwise, by the end of meal I was full and ready to wash the dauber stains off my hands.  Overall, Egg Works is a fun, neighborhood breakfast joint.  Its larger than meets the eye which Im sure helps move crowds on the weekends.  Service was consistent and friendly and the prices were very reasonable, especially given how much food each dish seems to contain.  Both our meals were in the 9 dollar range and there were few things that really exceeded that in price.  They also are open for lunch and have a selection of salads, sandwiches and burgers.  Diagnosis:  Delicious!
5	A well oiled machine is the headline to this story.  I sat at the counter and ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with Biscuits and Gravy.  I brought a book to read, but I was entertained by the staff's efficiency working a busy holiday monday.  If you want to open a diner and want to get an idea how to do things, come here at have a meal and observe.  Without boring you with the details, the pass through window was an symphony between the cooks and the servers.  Good communication and everyone knows what needs to be done (busy work) to keep things running smooth.  There is also a good quality control.  Several times, a manager asked to have items replated because the presentation wasn't to her standard.  In some cases, food was discarded and re-done.  The Quality of service was a big reason for 5 stars.  Now, to the food.  It was good.  My CFS was a deep fried variety.  The quest to find a pan fried CFS like Eat At Joe's in Redondo Beach, CA. is hard to find.  It was a good steak.  Seasoned well.  The home fries are also deep fried.  Crispy.  I personally prefer grilled home fries with some onion and bellpepper.  The biscuit was a bit dry.  So, my meal was just okay.  The other food I saw looked good.  I would come back and try the Corned Beef Hash.
5	After trying the sundance special for the very first time, I try so hard to try other items on the menu but I seem to always revert back to my Sundance Special! Love the potatoes and banana nut muffin with my breakfast!
5	Finally, a breakfast joint that just gets it.  They have a sense of urgency to get you seated and fed.  We love coming here and it has become our go to for breakfast and now even lunch.  We usually sit at the counter for breakfast and for some lame reason I can't remember the girls name that takes care of the counter but always does a great job and is always smiling and pleasant.  We have been coming here for about 3 years now and just recently ordered lunch one day and LOVED it.  Now we hit it up for lunch and avoid the large crowds but someday soon, lunches will probably catch on and there will be crowds.   Consistant food always quick and hot.  LOVE IT!! Thanks Egg Works team!!
5	I had the California egg-crepe with swiss cheese, bacon, guacamole, tomato, mushroom, and a side of hollandaise. It was amazing, to say the least! I was a little confused about an egg-crepe at first because I think of crepes as sweet and not usually egg-filled. But, to my delight, it was absolutely perfect! It reminded me more of an egg quesadilla, and it came with a heaping side of breakfast potatoes. Of course I had a bloody mary, and I have to say this one made my top 5 list..... if anything because it is served in a mason jar!  I definitely recommend this breakfast spot, but be prepared to wait awhile.... it is popular for a reason!
5	Heard hash house a go go is a great spot... we went and will have to try it someday soon... however... it was crowded at the door so when we learned of the 1 hour wait someone suggested Eggworks off of W. Flamingo. 5 minutes away and 15 minutes later we were sat with a party of 8 adults. There was just as big a crowd in a much smaller restaurant. We pass our food around to sample soo heres my story... Main reason though this gets a 5 is... Cottage Cheese is the BEST EVER period. Whatever was on top of it melted in my mouth. Food portions HUGE cost LOW (109.00 total with 8 big appetites) really impressive presentation for what is normally basic stuff.. hard to be creative with breakfast but they pull it off. Banana Bread French Toast... bit more of a dessert however it was SOOO GOOD! Potato Omelet original to me at least and we all secretly love starch on starch on starch on starch....... and the hostess had some Barbarella like hair do and was fun and took pics with us all... just great time this AM.....
2	I've only been here once and it was a disappointing visit. I got an order of the coconut french toast (I'm a sucker for anything with coconut). My wife got the regular french toast breakfast and our son got a kid's chocolate chip pancake shaped like Mickey Mouse. Both orders of french toast were less than stellar -- thin slices of bread that were over-cooked. I was hoping they would use bread that would make their french toast more unique and flavorful, but no. Just some boring flat slices. Personally, I think I can make better french toast. My son did enjoy his pancake and the sausage that it came with was very good. Reading other Yelp reviews, it sounds like most people get some banana nut muffins with their entree. We didn't get any. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I should have gotten one of the skillet dishes. I don't know. But, based on this one experience I'd rather eat breakfast at the Cracked Egg or Black Bear Diner.
4	This is a great family restaurant with an extensive menu, generous portions and good service. I've eaten the California Egg Crepe, The Cabo (breakfast burrito) and most recently 3 Way Chili (spaghetti, chili and cheese). Do yourself a favor and enjoy a cup of coffee with a banana nut muffin. It's a nice treat. Looking forward to my next visit.
2	Someone I work with recommended Egg Works for breakfast. So my mother and I went there. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Potatoes, and a cup of Coffee. The service was fast, very fast, so fast indeed that I wondered at the quality of the food. Sure enough it looks good, but in the taste department they came up way short! The Eggs looked like they had been mass produced and were pulled from one of those buffet style servers. The gravy tasted like it was canned and way too salty with not much hint of meat in it. The biscuit was stale!  The Potatoes, way too SALTY!!!! Smothering reheated frozen potatoes in seasoned salt doesn't cut it in my book! Finally the Coffee was decidedly bitter to both our tastes. I would not go there again!
5	Probably 4.5 stars, not the best breakfast spot I have ever had In this world but but hands down the best spot in vegas so it gets 5.  This place is also the same as the Egg & I and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent. There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.    They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.   My good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.
4	I came here on Saturday morning craving breakfast but I couldn't decide between their breakfast burrito or their Key Largo Crepe. I finally decided on the crepe because I thought that might be healthier...but now that I think about it I don't think either can be described as healthy. The Key Largo had Smoked Turkey, diced bacon, guacamole, diced tomatoes, and cheddar and jack cheese. Topped with sour cream and a side of salsa. It was also served with some potatoes on the side. This is the first non dessert crepe I have eaten so it had a lot to live up to. It was yummy but I think I will just stick to crepes as a dessert . I think it's because I've programmed myself to think of them as sweet and when I don't get that I think it comes up as second rate in my mind. I do know what I want to try there when I go back ...this lady next to me had this yogurt looking parfait . It had what looked like blueberries and mandarin oranges on the top.That may  be a contender on my next visit!
4	Upon walking into Egg Works, it looks and feels like any other diner. Once you take your seat and they hand you their menu which is a newspaper, you know that it's not quite ordinary. Once you get a chance to look around it has a whimsical country  farm feel that centers around eggs. Stuffed chickens and roosters here and there. Egg Works themed coffee cups and even when you need help, there's a egg sign you flip that has a sad face meaning that you need your waitress to help you with something. We never actually had to use it since the service was really friendly and great. They treat you like you've been there before after ordering. A nice 'down home' feel. One of the quirkier things is that the door to the bathrooms is built to look like an outhouse.I just ordered the Bacon and Eggs (what else?). It was a huge plate that additionally came with potatoes (the herby fried square kind). The eggs were fluffy and took up a large portion of the plate. The bacon was nice and crisp, but not overly so. Overall, it was so much that I couldn't finish it off. We also had the Vegetarian Greek Omelet.  I love feta cheese and never thought to mix it with eggs. It came out really tangy. Besides eggs, what is the next best thing? Four words: Homemade Banana Nut Muffins. I could just come here to eat these all by themselves. I'm not a muffin guy, but these dark pillowy muffins make my mouth water. A couple last things: The prices are really good for the amount and quality of food you get. No complaints here at all. The parking lot is fairly large, but I could see this place being really busy. When we went it was more toward afternoon, so the crowds dispersed by then. It's a place that's high on our list of places to revisit on our next trip.
4	Do you love eggs for breakfast? Well Egg Works is a great place to start up your day, you get the protein that you need and why not have it a way that you can enjoy. If your not an egg eating person no worries, they have french toast, waffles, pancakes, crepes, burgers and sandwiches. The location is great, good amount of parking, and the staff is very friendly. Sounds to me that this place would be a great place to eat and bring your family or friends. Not an early bird? It's okay they are open until 3PM, perfect for brunch. Tried so far: Chili Omelette (yummy in my tummy) The Classic (plain ol' me) Greek Scramble (gotta love the feta) Cabo Breakfast Burrito (say OLE) Banana Nut Muffin (to die for) Banana Nut French Toast (a little sweet but good)
4	Great for meet with friends. Free wifi
4	Food was good! Even though I didn't get my toast. So I don't know why the waitress asked me what kind of toast to go with my California Crepes. I chose sourdough and it says on the menu that I do get either toast or a muffin. Um I didn't get my toast and another waitress told me it doesn't come with it.On another visit, I had to add some salt/hot sauce to the crepes for flavor because it really lacked..Nicely cooked though.
4	We've been wanting to try this place since moving up to The Lakes over a year ago.  In need of a run to Lee's (which is in the same shopping center) on a Tuesday seemed like the perfect time.  Especially since there was no line wrapping around the building.  We were seated immediately.  5*'s. Drink orders taken within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5*'s.Waitress in the uniform pony tail popped over to take our order off the extensive menu within 1 minute of our drink order being taken.  Upon being told we weren't ready, she left and returned 15 minutes later.  2*'s. HUGE portions.  of Potatoes.  We had at our table.  Chicken enchilada omlet:  very tasty.  could have used a touch of spice.  but over all I'd get it again. Western omlet:  filled with goodness and the person ordering it took the other 1/2 he couldn't consume at the table..home. and he never ever takes home left overs.  Bandito scramble:  nice combo but kind of bland.  not enough chorizo to make it --wait for it -- EGGciting enough.  Coffee was delicious.  Of course any coffee for me is delicious if they are not serving Star bucks or Seattle's best.  Banana muffin.. worth the entire meal.  Moist, delicious and the alternative to extremely dry toast. Now we come to the waitress again.  Ok it was a Tuesday and there was never a line waiting and she had several open tables.  I think she might have either been new OR having a bad day but we had to turn our little eggy guy (see pics) to get our check & a to-go box.  Overall I'd say its a great find during the week.  Certainly not worth the wait for the massive lines we've seen on the weekend. We got in and out in about an hour and 15 minutes and under 50.00.  I'd say it was a good meal.
5	OK, seriously, who is up early enough to have breakfast at the crack of dawn, let alone at breakfast time, and no I don't mean at 2pm!?? and in Vegas?!? After hauling ass at 3am, taking a detour to Vegas thru Needles, we get there way too early for anything else, but hey, its Vegas. Some friends say I just HAD to try this place, if anything, the banant nut muffin. Makeup not done, hair not done, and literlly 4 hours of sleep, we're there with our big appetites.We get there and I ask for coffee, and immediately its served. Server was very nice and even took time to explain some of their specialties, their famous potatoes, and even their banana nut muffin. I was supposed to get a choice between a muffin or toast, but because I was a first timer, she gave me both. Muffin - Was like a taste of sweet heaven! Talk about an orgasmic feeling, and get your head out of the gutters! Made fresh, served warm where the butter melted on direct impact. I was in another world and forgot where I was at. This was the best banana nut muffin I've ever had.I ordered the country skillet which is basically their potatoes topped with country fried steak, 2 eggs and their country gravey- Potatoes were to die for. Not your usual potatoes, but these were crispy and served with season salt. I was in love with the potatoes itself! Only downfall was that the potatoes are better off on the side vs topped with all that other good stuff. Friend ordered corn beaf and hash - defintely excellent, but I still favored my country skillet. Service was excellent. Coffee was never empty, and defintely service with a smile. If you haven't been here yet, this is definitely worth the drive from the strip, even more so, if you're up early enough, this is definintely the place to go.
5	Seriously, I'm addicted to this place. Best place for breakfast and brunch outside the strip. I have tried other options and I always return to eggworks. It's super tasty. Perfect for a nice  Sunday breakfast.My personal favorites are:1- bacon and avocado omelette. 2-bandito scramble (super good deal cause it includes a choice of toast or banana muffin)3-Classic Benny (always cooked perfectly)4-Works scarmble is algo good. The waiters are always friendly. I go every weekends. The banana muffin is good. The cinnamon roll is great. Eggworks is like sunday church for me. And I always leave happy.
5	THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO GO TO FOR BREAKFAST IN VEGAS!we come to egg works every single time we get to vegas.  and we try to get here at least twice on our trips.  everything i have had here is good.  this place has the best muffins too - a banana nut muffin (that you can get instead of toast) with the hugest muffin top you'll probably ever see.  their potatoes are also the best breakfast potatoes of any breakfast restaurant we've been to - they are flavorful and crispy.  the service has always been great and fast, the food comes quickly, and the prices are very reasonable.  if you havent given egg works a try, you def gotta go.
5	MY NEW FAVEI had the Breakfast Burrito-it's filled with scrambled eggs, peppers, bacon, potatoes,  and 2 kinds of cheese with a side of salsa and their seasoned potatoes...It comes cut in half & has the neatness of a wrap.  It comes with a huge portion of seasoned potatoes-you could split this with another if you want : ) My husband had the Corn Beef Hash which actually had a good-size amount of shredded corn beef with hash mixed in, eggs, and more seasoned potatoes.  His meal included bread/muffin. He chose the muffin-banana nut this morning.  He said it was awesome! They also leave you with a carafe of coffee.  It was super busy but the service was great!  The Cracked Egg used to be my fave but I think I'm  an Egg Works' girl now!
5	Great Vegas breakfast place.  The food is great, the service is great, and the whole place has personality.If you're looking to eat breakfast somewhere off of the strip, Egg Works has you covered.
4	I usually work nights, so breakfast for me is usually lunch for most people. That being said, on the rare occasions that I'm up before 11am, I get a little excited to eat breakfast foods, and usually, Eggworks is my to-go place. As their name suggests, they serve typical breakfast faire; omelets, breakfast meats and egg plates, waffles, pancakes, etc., but most of their menu is centralized around the always versatile protein. My personal favorites are the scrambles, specifically 'The Works' scramble, which is a medley of 3 scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, mushroom, onions and bell peppers. Simplicity wins here at Eggworks, and their consistency of the quality of food is what keeps me a returning customer. They also give you an option of toast or banana nut muffin with your meal, but I have to urge you to opt for the muffin, it is mighty tasty. Service has been good up to date, and it can get very busy during primetime breakfast hours, especially Sunday. So if you're in the area, ignore the national franchise pancake houses and diners and come here, it works.
4	As a former employee of this place, I'm slightly bias......SLIGHTLY!~The food is consistently cooked the same way, YUM!  You can go to any of the three locations, order the same thing, and it will ALWAYS taste the same.  Good deal!~PUMPKIN PANCAKES..........are delicious! ~Banana nut french  toast.......what?!?!?!?~The staff is fantastic and always willing to help me modify (egg whites, light cheese, easy seasoning) as I so desire. ~Bloody Marys and mimosas in the a.m..........yes please! *It is a DO recommend for breakfast, brunch, or lunch in my book!
4	Down-home breakfast spot, very un-Vegas!Egg Works reminds me so much of those cozy midwest diners I miss so much being in Nevada.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is personable, and pleasant on the eye, and the decor screams of the house you grew up in.The potatoes which accompany most of the menu items are seasoned with Egg Work's special blend of dry spices.  Some may find them a bit on the salty side, but most leave salivating for more.  Everything can be customized to your preference, and even ordered in half-portions for those without monstrous appetites.  Bottom LIne:  Great Coffee, family friendly breakfast spot always a great way to start the day.
4	Confession of a Banana Nut Muffin Lover: It all started with a desire to find the Mister a good American breakfast joint.  Having grown up in Vietnam, I do really prefer a French first meal (Vietnam was colonized by France and thus most of us are self-admitted Francophiles) and have subjected my loved ones to French breakfasts and brunches galore!  My fiance, however, had a good ol' American upbringing in the Midwest and ate morning carbohydrates like pancakes.Enter Egg Works: adorable down-to-earth breakfast restaurant, all themed around ...Eggs!  Even the decor is completed with classic paintings with egg-ish slants, all the faces are replaced by eggs (including the Mona Lisa).  There is a plethora of egg dishes for you to order, my favorite is the egg-crepe, a tasty blend of crepe batter and egg (perfect compromise of French American traditions).  But the various egg benedicts (called Bennys at Egg Works) are also done well, including one that comes with prime rib on top of a buttered croissant - truly a diet sabotage worth your time. But like most food love affairs: you come across that one delight so casually and unintentionally, this was how it began for me and the banana nut muffin.  I was not really even a muffin enthusiast, until then.  Adjectives like moist, soft, warm, perfectly sweet cannot deliver the experience of this muffin.  All I can say is, just try it and you'll know love, too!
5	I vote this place absolute best breakfast joint in the continental US.  I dined with six companions, about half of them vegetarian, and not a single morsel of food returned to the kitchen, just empty plates.  No, not the best coffee anywhere, but above average for diner-style.  Their spicy twist on the ubiquitous breakfast potatoes turned what, for me, is usually an ignored side dish into the crux of the meal.  Biscuits & gravy rate high on the Richter scale.  The menu had too many items for me to quickly choose, and I will be back to sample more.  Service was friendly and TCB in a flash.  Excellent value!!!
5	Usually if a restaurant wait is longer than 15 minutes, I'll mosey on over to the next option. Egg Works is the one exception to my rule. Ever since we've moved to Vegas, we utilized the full power of the Yelp community to assist us with finding our new "regular" joints. So mucho props to you all.Like I said, the wait time is sometimes longer during the peak breakfast/brunch hours - but damn the wait is worth it. There's limited space inside for those waiting, so I'd avoid the busy times during the extreme Summer/Winter days.The serving sizes are huge, so there's a nice "half" option for those of you without the hyper-asian metabolisms. Prices are reasonable and the menu selections will keep you wanting to try something new every time.The one bummer thing is the hours. This being Las Vegas - I would assume they stay open late. I suppose it makes sense them serving breakfast food and all (they stop seating at 3PM). Their Loco Moco at 2AM would be friggin' epic.Count us in as the new local regulars here!
5	The staff was very accomodating to my hockey team.  The wait was lengthy, but we showed up at a busy time, and it gave us all a chance to chat.  Once we got seated, they were very solicitous, and gave us great service.  Service was quick, as well.  They checked on us regularly, and fixed anything that seemed amiss.  If you have a chance, check out their website, www.theeggworks.com.  I ordered the chicken pot pie.  The serving was rather large, so I couldn't finish it.  It was served in a bread bowl, and was the ultimate in comfort food.  The chicken and veggies were in a warm, creamy sauce.  I was in heaven!  Looking around at my teammates' entrees, I noticed that the biscuits and gravy looked great!  I'd come back to try that choice!
5	Great breakfast food. Get there early because they fill up fast!
4	I enjoy a good hearty breakfast, so eating here makes really good sense. The menu selection is focused on, what else, eggs, so there are numerous omelets to choose from and you can get any style of eggs and the portions are very large and can keep you satisfied for most of the day. They also serve lunch with sandwiches and burgers. Today I tried the bacon avocado omelet with potatoes and toast . My husband came with me and he wanted to try the carrot cake french toast. this was very delightful and we enjoyed it. He also ordered the tuna melt and it's toasted inside out approach to this sandwich is what makes it unique. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with the menu or the service. We have been to their Phoenix location as well, and it's this restaurants consistency that we count on to keep us coming back.
4	i did expect more of a menu, but then again nothing else mattered after I saw the mashed potato ommelette ok the menu. I used to get it at a small local place but it shut down and nobody else serves it...until now!!!! Muffins are not as good as what the RJ says and the chilli is kind of bland. Stick to the mashed potato ommelette and take a long walk afterwards. gravy are good also.
4	Okay, so I've been eating breakfast here for, like, five years. I figure it's time I write a review.I don't have anything particularly unique to add to the other reviews here. The food is pretty consistent, though I commonly order between 4 or 5 dishes. The cooks overdo it with the cheese and Works seasoning sometimes, but I've come to expect that so I plan for it. "Easy on the cheese" or "no seasoning on the potatoes". They seem cool with that.The service? It can be hit or miss, though more hit than miss. In fairness, I almost always sit at the counter, and if Rochelle is working, I'm taken care of. I've never had awful service, but the dining room can get really busy and the service suffers for it.When I first started coming here, I couldn't stand the "decor". Sadly, it's grown on me. I'm *this* close to buying a tie-dyed EggWorks t-shirt. My favorite part? It's a local small business. I feel good supporting them, and that's what's most important... They make me feel good about myself. haha
4	EGGS!!!  Excuse me for the exclamation, but I do love eggs with a passion.  For that reason alone, having the word "Egg" as part of an establishment's name is usually enough to lure me in.I can't really comment on wait times for a table, as I usually come by my poor lonesome self and sit at the counter with a magazine or the paper, but there is usually no wait for the counter.  The staff is fast and attentive, almost immediately getting my drinks as I sit down.  They have a couple of televisions above the counter, one on sports and the other on news.  Each table and counter seat has a flip egg for when you need service.  The egg with the smiley face on it (it's actually a pretty creepy smiley face, the kind of face that says "hey baby wanna leave with me tonight?") means everything is well.  The egg with the frowny, constipated looking face means you need attention, and the one time I had to use this they were extremely quick to respond.  Most of them items on the menu have eggs (dur), and the portions are very large.  Omelets are made with four eggs instead of three.  I usually order the Three Pigs, which is an omelet with cheese (usually order without it though to decrease the fattiness), sausage, ham and bacon, served with either fried potatoes and toast or banana nut muffin.  The Omelet itself is amazingly delicious and the potatoes tasty with this seasoning they drizzle over it.  I usually order toast, as I really don't care for the banana nut muffin.Random quirk: The door to the bathroom is built to look like an outhouse!  Cute looking, but still retaining the functionality of modern plumbing!The food is a bit pricey, but you generally get what you pay for.  If you live in the southwest part of the valley, you owe it to yourself to check this gem out.PROS:Eggs, eggs, and more eggs!  Big portions for you egg loversFast and attentive and friendly wait staff.Flip egg so you can call for service without looking awkwardCONS:A bit pricey.THE VERDICT:  A great place to go on a semi-regular basis.
4	Arrived at 9:00 on a Friday morning.  No wait at all.  I was surprised it wasn't busier...Egg works offers a large slightly overwhelming newspaper style menu.  The service was super friendly, fast, and smiley.  We had three breakfasts and three coffees for $36.  Price is right.Momma was thrilled with her eggs benny with spinach.  She opted for fruit on the side and was all but licking the perfectly cooked egg yolks out of the bottom of her dish.  She was also happy the fruit wasn't the usual melon cop out but fresh pineapple and orange slices.I could not resist the temptation of the chicken enchilada omelette.  Theis creative breakfast omelette weighed approximately 4 lbs. and was served with at least 3 servings of crispy seasoned potatoes.  The portion was huge! I brought half home.  The omelette had chicken, green chiles, enchilada sauce, and cheese, and crispy tortillas baked on top for a crunchy surprise.  Very good.  Nothing needed salt or pepper.   Hot, yummy, and nicely seasoned.  The leave a carafe of coffee on the table for your convenience and provide french vanilla coffee creamer. BONUS POINTS!The decor is super cute; not too kitchy.  Little egg details everywhere and an outhouse style bathroom door.   I'll go back for sure when I'm ready for another super sized breakfast.
4	What? I can have prime rib in my eggs benedict? Awesome! Last November (2010), I fell in love with getting breakfast/brunch after coming to this place (I dont care if NPH says guys can't have brunch together!) I wanted to try one of their omelets, but couldn't pass on the hollandaise sauce... mmm.This place is GREAT, but the wait was pretty long (40 minutes) on a Sunday afternoon (1pm). It's also pretty far from the strip. We messed up and didn't notice that they had a sister egg works closer to the hotels. If you're staying on the strip, try the Egg and I instead.
4	Great food! This place is always packed but it is well worth the wait. Wife had the original breakfast burrito. It's a no frills meal, egg, cheese and potatos in a tortilla. Did I say potato? Man, they overload the plate with potatos that invariably have to take home. I wonder how many potatoes get thrown out but I digress.....I had the Reuben. It's a decadent sandwich done just how I like it. The potato salad (did I say potato) is killer. The mustard in the potato salad takes it over the top (reminds me of a good Southern style potato salad). Definitely a place to go for good comfort food.
4	I love Egg Works, after a night of partying, it's the perfect place to go to cure any lingering  aftereffects.I love the eggs Benedict and the biscuits and gravy with the homestyle potatoes, definitely won't go wrong with either, and did I mention they also serve SPAM???!!!  How awesome is that?I heart Egg Works!
5	I've been here 3 times, and it gets better every time!! I really love croissants, so I order an egg dish called Sunrise Mountain. It's topped with loads of melted cheese over scrambled eggs and your choice of meat. A classic dish, but they make it taste unique with their special potatoes (probably unhealthy, but very tasty). The serving sizes are way too big, but I like having leftovers in the fridge. The service is great, too. If you ever need anything, you just flip this cute little egg over and someone comes to your table right away. You can tell it's a popular place by the sheer number of customers and workers. Restaurant could probably use more space.
5	I've been to Vegas almost a dozen times now, and my favorite spot has always been Egg Works. It's quaint place with the most delicious omelettes are just to die for. Yes, I am willing to drive 10 minutes outside of the strip just to come to this place.The portions are insane for the price they charge as well. My favorite part also is it really makes me happy to see the sun shining through the window while I eat breakfast, remembering the evening before. As you know, in Vegas - there is always something to remember the night before.
4	Excellent breakfast restaurant. Always busy and staff handles it great. Coffee is real good as well.
4	This place has better food, service and prices than the much hyped and over-rated Hash House A Go Go.  Hash House is nothing more than a tourist destination that out-of-towners feel they must check off their bucket lists due to the TV time and praise it's received from clueless celebrities visiting Vegas.  However, I bet the celebrities actually GET the service and CORRECT orders without the LONG wait times for their food to arrive.  So yes...go there if you are a celebrity...they may actually take care of you.Locals know the real deal for breakfast is at Eggworks (or their other locations Eggworks II & The Egg and I) where you avoid the annoying families on vacation happy to overpay for their mediocre meals in exchange for bragging rights of being able to say, "Hash House A Go Go...Of course I've been there!"  I've also noticed the weekend-wanna-be-bad-ass biker crowd likes to be "seen" at Hash House as well which makes it all that less cool if you ask me.Eggworks makes my favorite Eggs Benedict of all...The Blacken Prime Rib Benny.  I've had Eggs Benedict with plain ham, exotic ham, salmon, chicken, crab...you name it.  None are as delicious as the one these guys put together with blackened prime rib!  I wish I could find a place in Seattle that would make me a Benny this good!Be prepared to wait for a table in the mornings on the weekend but be assured that once you are seated, your food will come out fast and fantastic!  I really don't enjoy traditional breakfast foods, but this joint knows how to make EGGCITING breakfasts with a gourmet flare.
5	I must go there 4-5 times per week. Food is good, staff is pretty good. Order the Works Crepe - the dressing is insane!!
4	Looking for breakfast away from the strip and without a 2 hour wait?  Try this place out!  Egg Works came highly recommended from the yelp pages.  Their breakfast menu is pretty huge so take some time to look it over.  I went with the country fried steak smothered in a nice sausage gravy.  I also got a nice side of linguica  and white rice!  Oh the carnage!  Yes, my arteries may not have been too happy with me but my stomach was content.  Prices are very reasonable with nothing on the menu topping over $14 for the most part.  Well worth the trip of strip!
5	The best place for breakfast hands down. oh yeah there is that other great breakfast Joint egg and I. if you don't know there the same  restaurant different name. my girl friend and i love this place. I'm surprise they don't know my order by know. their bacon and onion skillet is the best.
4	Breakfast here is amazing. My personal fav are the potatoes, they are just perfect. Will be returning to egg works next time I'm in vegas
5	My second fav breakfast spot. I come for the banana nut muffins and coffee,but always order an omelette too. They all come with zesty square potatoes that are wonderful. Every time I go it's busy, and rightfully so.
1	The attention to detail has for some reason been thrown out the window at the place! I've been a fan of the Egg and I chain for a long time but this location at W. Flamingo and Fort Apache has tarnished the name. The staff is rude and uptight, with a "why are you bothering me for extra napkins" attitude/mentality. Also, the order should be checked for accuracy BEFORE it is even brought to the table!!!I will NEVER be back to Egg Works AGAIN - IT IS TERRIBLE!!!
2	meh. very meh. i guess my expectations were set too high looking at the 4 star average review for the place but it leaves me wondering where have these people been eating breakfast and why is this considered to be somewhat of a breakfast institution. it all makes sense when you compare it to crack egg's 4 star average, another place i dont care for, but not put next to hash house a go go's 4 stars-a completely different breakfast experience.
4	*****2011 Entertainment book...buy one get one free meal coupon*******Was hankering to eat out for breakfast one morning so I looked on Yelp for ideas. As luck would have it after deciding on Egg Works I also found a coupon for buy one get one free meal in my Entertainment book...score!Wow, I have been missing out. I truly enjoyed my experience!What we ordered! All was Hearty, fresh and delicious!The portions are VERY LARGE.Denver OmeletteCheese, ham, green peppers and onion.Chicken Enchilada OmeletteSliced seasoned chicken, greenchilies, cheddar and jack cheese folded inside, thentopped with a tasty enchilada sauce, more cheese, homemadetortilla chips and a scoop of sour cream***By using my buy one get one coupon they deducted $15.30 from our bill! Talk about savings for such an enormous hefty meal! We walked out a winner, stuffed and happy!!!!!!!!Fantastic service and food! The quality can't be beat!Will be back soon...very soon!
5	THE best place for breakfast food. Beats IHOP, Dennys, etc etc out of the water. Servers are very attentive and friendly...Just flip the egg! Environment is clean and they also have tvs around the restaurant tuned to news and sports. Recomendations: Opt for the banana muffin instead of toast! I typically hate muffins but this muffin is out of this universe. It has a strong aroma and taste of banana and you can also physically see the nuts in them.The Works Omelette: Loaded with all different kinds of meat and vegetables. Comes with their works potato which is a must have.Country Fried Steak: A GIGANTIC slab of chicken fried steak and drizzled with soo much gravy. The gravy is creamy and savory and pairs perfectly with the fried steak.
4	I am still a huge fan of this place, and I have wandered around the menu since my last review. This morning I had the Egg Taliana (which is eggs, with italian sausage, homemade marinara, and I want to say monterrey jack cheese). My husband had their Banana Nut french toast (comes with maple syrup and apple compote). This place has not disappointed us. If you haven't gotten breakfast here... YOU ARE MISSING OUT!
4	Great breakfast food!!! Im originally from california and im used to going to IHOP and Dennys for breakfast so this was amazing compared to cali places. They have amazing potato and fries. I love their seasoning...salty but sooo good. I ordered a waffle with strawberries and cream, bacon, 2 eggs for less than $10! I think thats a great deal. The only downfall is waiting for a table. Overall awesome breakfast place...u must go!
5	breakfast is the most important meal of the day why not make it a great one, yes of course what you are going to eat here its not going to be the healthiest but it is delicious. I am from LA and this is one of the reasons i would come to vegas that omelette with feta to die for and blueberry pancakes with cashews wow.if you head to vegas follow the locals and this is one of those places,
4	As someone who can live with coffee for breakfast and nothing else, for me to crave breakfast food can only mean one thing...this place is bomb. The portions are massive and for some of them they allow half orders, a life saver for someone like me, with eyes always bigger than my stomach. The skillets are great mainly because they include the breakfast potatoes, that are unlike any other I've had. So great! I have a love affair with eggs benedict and it does not disappoint here. The banana nut muffins are a work of art for your mouth and usually warm from the oven. YUM. Maybe the best part about this joint is the cute little egg on the table. You turn it to a sad face if you need anything at all, and the servers practically break their necks running over to you when a sad egg is spotted. The place gets busy but it's pretty big so the wait goes fast. There are plenty of TV's too, usually on news or sports. So get out of bed and get over there!
5	Wow, this place just does breakfast right. If someone was looking for a template on how to make a great breakfast diner, they should look no further than egg works.First the service... they have a egg smiley face at your table that you can turn into a frowny face if you need immediate service. If you make it a frowny face, your server will come almost immediately. I've really never needed to use this however because our server almost always has checked in on us at good times.Now the food. Holy crap is this stuff good. If you're dieting, don't go here because it's too tempting. I would reccommend something, but really everything is good. Make sure to get a side of potatoes because they're fantastic and seasoned very well. If you haven't been here yet and you live in Vegas, go! If your not in west Vegas, try the Egg and I, it's by the same people and the experience is basically the same.
4	It is a good place if it is not a weekend morning when they are packed... Every time we try to go on a Sunday there is a really long line:(  The checkout is a not the best part and I would like it if they allowed you to just pay the waitress at your table.  It would seem that the waitress would get better tips that way!  I am looking for another breakfast place in the area, as I am too impatient to wait when I am starving... So send me your recommendations.
4	EGGCITING!!!First time here,  decor was cute.  My wife is into the decor and cleanliness and she was happy!  And, so was I.  The service was eggcellent and friendly.  We felt like like the locals eating at our secret spot!My wife had the Brads Scramble and I had the Carnitas.  The Brads Scramble was awesome.  Fresh spinach, mushroom, cheese... yum.  And I am a carnivore.  However, my Carnitas was good but too salty.  To be honest, I couldn't finish it because of the saltiness.  If I lived in Vegas, I would be a regular here.  Good food, nice service, cute decor.  Yup, I'll be back.
5	Egg Works is a great breakfast and lunch diner. But, it is also home to the best Cincinnati chili west of Western Hills. They are expanding all over town. Go for a 3, 4 or 5-Way and life is good. Very friendly staff and solid service.
4	My Favorite place to eat for breakfast, hands down.  Great service.  For some reason, even their tap water tastes really good.  Sunrise mountain is my favorite.
5	Delish is all I can say!  I had the mashed potato omelet and it was simply mouth-watering.  An omelet stuffed with garlic mashed potatoes, bacon, and cheese.  It came with a side of breakfast potatoes and toast.  A ton of food for only $10.  We had to wait a little bit to be seated (but to me that just says how great it is that so many people want to eat there), we had excellent service and overall just a wonderful experience.  I highly recommend!
4	Eggsactly what I was looking for in a breakfast place while in Vegas!!! Such a great classic breakfast with hearty servings. This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas that I visit everytime I go back. I'm a sucker for Eggs Benedict and while many people have written about them, they seriously are consistently good everytime. Poached eggs cooked just right served under a nice blanket of hollandaise. It's overall the classic taste you're looking for in a homecooked breakfast. My friends are always pleased when I take them here. *Note: They do get REALLY busy! But you know, they also do a great job of providing service that's friendly and quick. Our wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. I say, stick around and enjoy the ambiance!! Much better to hang out for a table than drive around in the desert sun looking for some place that will compare....and it's going to be a while before you find that place. :)
5	This place has become one of my all-time favorite breakfast joints.  I have been here a few times now and never do they disappoint. My two favorite dishes are the stuffed french toast (it's basically a french toast sandwich with eggs, cheese, and your choice of bacon, ham, or sausage.) I usually get this with bacon and it is by far amazing. I love sweet and savory dishes equally so this dish is the perfect balance for me.Second favorite dish is the banana bread french toast (can you tell I love french toast?? lol). But this is by far THE BEST french toast I have EVER TASTED. It's so soft, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you're craving something on the sweeter side, this is definitely the dish for you. It will NOT disappoint. Portions sizes are generous, I usually always have leftovers (which make a great snack for later). The service has always been quick, efficient and friendly, though, I I've seen this place get pretty busy (especially on weekend mornings) so expect to wait a little if you choose to go then.  Their menu is pretty impressive (lots to choose from so I need to start venturing out of my "comfort zone" and try other things). So for all you breakfast lovers out there -- this place is without a doubt a must-try... I can pretty much guarantee there's something for everybody!
5	This place is a must for breakfast! I have been going here been eating here for several years and the food and service have been consistently good. Prices are very reasonable and portions are humongous. I've tried a bit of everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. The warm banana muffins are the best and you can pre-order a banana loaf to go (which I have yet to do for fear of the havoc it will wreak on my waistline). Love the hash browns. They also have Hawaiian breakfast specialties.
3	The service is excellent and the wait time wasn't too bad. Only about 10-15 minutes to get a table, which is reasonable for a weekend spot. The restaurant is clean and definitely a popular spot for breakfast since every table was filled. The food unfortunately didn't "wow" me. I ordered the Three Pigs omelette, which was covered with a massive amount of jack cheese. So much that the grease from the cheese puddled into one corner of the omelette.  I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.I would definitely return again and try another dish. It's difficult to find a great breakfast spot, so I won't rule this place out. I unfortunately can't give it a four or five star rating like most of the reviews on here because it just wasn't that spectacular.
3	Easy to find a  parking space, when busy not to long of a wait, service is great and clean... Unfortunately there is way too much seasoning on potatoes , next time i better try hash browns, if they have that option? And the omelets and crepes tend to get cooked too much and so inside ingredients tend to be dry.. But the portions are huge and they offer a 2 for 1 buy coupon in the local paper. And the best thing that comes with breakfast instead of toast,opt for the banana nut muffin, that is real yummy...
3	Eggs works is pretty cute with the newsprint menus and cute mugs.We tried it out not wanting to have motel breakfast or some fast food joint and it was ok.The portions were huge (seems to be a theme at most American restaurants) so if you want a huge breakfast, definitely go here.Service is great.
5	Love the Benedicts and the Hawaiian breakfasts.
4	Service from Staci was excellent. The food and service are always great. Brought my daughter in for a daddy/daughter breakfast and it was great as usual. I really appreciate that they have turkey sausage (no turkey bacon yet) for those of us that do not eat pork.**Don't order the yogurt parfait... very small and expensive. You will be disappointed.
5	This place is amazing!  The bacon mashed potato omelet is a must.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.
5	I usually go to the one on flamingo but noticed this one since I live near by. I waited a few months for it to open and finally opened this monday. Went to go visit tuesday and ordered my usual corned beef hash and spinach egg and it tasted just as good as the other one. The staff was very friendly, and the place was very clean. Will definitely be back.
4	Like the other locations, this place consistently delivers great food, variety, and exceptional service which keeps this place ridiculously busy.Our server was super nice.  At first we got sat at a small 2 person table with no width but our server was sweet and generous pulling one of her other 2 tops to combine so we had room.  Some servers may have been hesistant or may not have even offered since they'd essentially be giving up more tip.  We defintely kept that in mind when paying.As for food, we had the Prime Rib Steak Benedict which was a unique addition to their massive menu.  Rather than a standard bene, it was over their croissant which provided for an intense and rich experience.  I loved the pairing with the hollandaise sauce and spinach.  We rounded the meal out with a waffles combo which was perfectly crisped but soft which was topped with whipped cream and bananas.  We had enough food to take home to have a second breakfast the next day.You can't really go wrong at Egg Works and the Egg family.  It's not Denny's/IHOP and it's not Bouchon, but they are really good at providing quick, tasty breakfasts.
2	I was excited about going to Eggworks because I have seen good reviews and I have seen the long lines waiting to get in.  Unfortunately, my meal was rather underwhelming.  I ordered flavored coffee and they gave me regular coffee that tasted like burnt rubber, melted into a molasses like consistency.  They also forgot to give me the side dish that I ordered.  The poached eggs and toast were serviceable but nothing out of this world. Biting into the chicken fried steak was like chewing on beef jerky that has been smothered by plain Crisco.  The best thing about the meal were the little pre-packaged packets of jam.  The decor is a half hearted attempt at country kitsch.  The place is mostly decorated with a massive throng of humanity.  I find it perplexing why the place is so popular.  Go to the Coffee Cup in Boulder City to find what Eggworks strives to be.
5	**Hours**       - 6am - stop seating at 3pm**Summary**       - Best of Both Worlds - You get the quality control and pricing of chain restaurants with the taste and feel of a family owned joint. This is the fourth in a string of egg works in town and the first that is actually close to me.       - Seasoned Center Cut New York Steak - One of the two items I always get when I'm here. They use their own special seasoning that makes the steak simply delicious.       - Works Potatoes - Seasoned home fried potatoes. Their seasoning is so good they even sell it. Their fries are done the same way.       - Banana Nut Muffin - Comes with almost every dish. It's sinful how moist and addicting this muffin is. If it's your first time and your entree doesn't come with it, I believe they'll give you one anyway. They know it's like crack and it'll keep you coming back.       - Works Burger - The other item I always get. Sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. Need I say more. It tastes just as good as it sounds.       - Bennies - If you like eggs benedict, they have 5 different kinds. One even is topped with blackend prime rib.**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice breakfast or lunch place.
2	Egg works did not "Work-out" too well for me ;-/ Which Is a shame because I love LOVEEEEE breakfast....I can have It for lunch, dinner you name It. I Imagined this place to be near "Mind-Blowing" because I had heard many great things about It but to my disappointment It was not up to par. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash meal to go, service was speedy so I do have to give them that but the staff did seem to be  too busy talking amongst themselves to greet properly, The one girl who took my order was a bit snooty. My hash was not good, It had a really strong beef taste like they had just taken It off the cattle and the eggs had a rubbery texture to It., Not at all what I expected :-(
4	Wow, I was utterly surprised and glad I've tried this place. Probably one of the best breakfast places I've ever had. I'm just a little upset that I have to travel 300+ miles to go to this place. I wish this came make this place or something similar to it here in the bay.If I'm not mistaken I ordered "This Little Piggy" breakfast skillet. Which contained a combination of crisp bacon, diced ham, pork sausage, and bubbling cheeses. And yes it just as mouth watering as it sounds. What I did like most was their seasoned potatoes that came with my meal. Can't believe there are no other similar places like this around the bay. I simply fell in love with their breakfast there. You better believe this spot will be a must stop every time I come to Vegas. I can go on an on about this place buy I'll save some thoughts for an update review when I come back trying another meal.Next update will be on a new meal, service and environment (this place has a shizzzz load of flat screens). Thanks for breakfast Egg Works, I'll be back for more.
4	Good banana nut muffins, love the greek omelet and the bacon and avocado omelet and the potatoes are good here as well. Biggest area of opportunity here is the french toast and it is still good.
4	Been here a couple times.. Different locations first time to this one.. Line was pretty fast Saturday AM.. Food was good.. nothing really amazing.. but it is good reasonably priced breakfast food.. I would go there anytime if you in the mood for some home style cooking.
3	This place is always crowded.  Service was very good.  Food is just average..it's eggs.  Food is expensive for breakfast.. $10.95 for veggie eggs Benedict, yes for poached eggs on an English muffin with a few spinach leaves and slices of avocado.   Potatoes are dry and too salty.  Carrot cake French toast was too sweet.  Breakfast for 2 with only 1 small glass of OJ was $19. with tip, after using an $8.00 coupon.  Pricey for a non-memorable breakfast.  Go across street to Shucks, all breakfast entrees are only $3.95!
3	Food 2.5. Service 4.I'm not an American breakfast lover so my review can be viewed as skewed.I ordered the Chile Relleno Omelet with a side of potatoes. I didn't like my dish because the egg was overcooked and somewhat rubbery. Also, the omelet was really thick and it had way too much bland cheese on top of it and also inside of it. And the red salsa on top was so ambigous; it didn't taste like tomato, it wasn't spicy, what was it? It was convenient that the potatoes were cubed into small bite sizes but it was definitely overseasoned; my husband didn't like the ratio of surface area:seasoning and I completely agree with him. I tried the banana nut muffin but it wasn't worth the calories so I only ate the spillage of the muffin top and ignored the rest. The coffee was swallowable but it had the typical diner taste. On a positive note, it helped me "go" after breakfast so it was somewhat useful. On the other hand, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and simply put "did her job well." Conclusion: Maybe I ordered the wrong dish? I really wanted to like it, sorry!
2	Food 2; Service 3.5 ... So overall about a 2.75 but I don't round up.I really LOVE breakfast and honestly, this place simply was a drag. The only thing that I could agree to love was the gravy. The biscuits were "doughy" but the gravy masked it. It was simply that good. The other items, eggs, bacon were just meh. The potatoes were the biggest disappointment... just crunchy squares.Waitress was nice and very attentive. Just wish the food lived up to the hype.
5	Very busy but very efficient service. Banana Nut Muffins as good as everybody says. Great omelet. Would definitely go back.
4	Really good breakfast.  Have never ordered lunch here, so I can't comment.  But the breakfast is really good.Eggs cooked to perfection, great bacon, great banana nut muffin, decent potatoes, and excellent coffee.  The omelets are big, and good.  And the chicken fried steak is pretty good too.Good service even when it's busy... which it usually is at breakfast.  Decent prices for what you get.
4	Haole loco and island favorite.  One of the best breakfast places in Las Vegas.  Service is quick.  Recommend going before 9:30 on weekends before it gets busy and have to wait for a table.
5	This is the best place to get breakfast in Vegas. Went here a bunch of times and loved everything. Everyone loved everything, and I was here in groups. I don't know that there's anything bad on the menu. You could order blindfolded and whatever you get will be good. If this existed in our area, we'd practically live here. The only downside is it's not on the Strip, so if your reasons for being in Vegas put you on the Strip all the time, you have to go out of your way and maybe you don't have time for that. We happened to be visiting friends who live nearby and that's how we knew about it. If you're not renting a car, this is out of the way of anything you might be doing on the Strip that you could otherwise walk to. That being said, it's delicious and inviting and groups hold their meetings here so everyone will be happy and satisfied. So go!!
5	This was my favorite breakfast in Vegas.  Nothing compared to it.  It is worth the trip off the strip.  Cheap, good food.  The servers are friendly.  They have a happy, sad egg sign that you turn over when you need attention from your waiter.  It has a very warm atomosphere.
5	I love egg works!! :) This place is my favorite breakfast place in the world!! Today I am having a works beni with scrambled eggs &  breakfast potatoes. Being a vegetarian I love there fresh fruit plate with cottage cheese. The staff is always super friendly and very accommodating. I love taking my dates here also they have such a great menu! 5stars for egg works!!
4	Great breakfast place for decent price. I got the board special - eggs scrambled with Mexican chicken and tortilla strips. Very hearty and satisfying. I would have liked more spice or Mexican flavors, but that's a personal preference. Would recommend to anyone who needs fueling before a day of hiking.
5	I always get the Piggy Skillet.Bacon, Ham, Sausage, potatoes, cheese & over easy eggs..So amazing & just under $10. This is our casual breakfast spot, at least once a week.
5	I went here on a Saturday, and literally every walk of life was there. From church goers, to hungover twenty somethings. It looked a little grim at first with there being about 20 people waiting, but we had a table in 5 minutes. I think it's because we came a little but later at almost 11, but once we were sat the place was still pretty busy. I have to hand it to them though, it was slammed and the customer service was still great and we really didn't have to wait very long to get our food. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was pretty awesome, but the main attraction here is the potatoes. I dunno what they use to season them, but it was nothing I'd had at breakfast time before. I'll go back, for sure.
4	A good place if you want a large plate of food at affordable prices. The breakfast food was good.  I had the Hawaii Breakfast special.  The large plate of food came with eggs, pineapple, sausages, and rice.  The rice doesn't seem to fit.  The food was great and hit the spot.  Oh yeah, don't skip over the fresh made banana nut muffins.  They were delicious.
4	Your typical breakfast place, but since it's close to my house and they've always taken care of me. Plus, they have TVs running sportscenter usually.
1	Just about every item on the menu is $10 bucks.  Since all the prices are about the same it makes it easy to pick what you like but by the time you add $2.90 for coffee you start to wonder if breakfast is worth that much.  Add the fact that your choice of potatoes is frozen tiny pieces which seasoning or a nearly exact replica of Mikey D's hash brown patties - yes frozen also.  After not being asked which on of these wonderful potato choices I preferred last visit , I decided it would be my last.
4	Good food.  Friendly staff, good value.  Very glad I we ate breakfast here before we left Las Vegas.  My only criticism is that the "Works Potatoes" were a tad over seasoned.  Not sure what their seasoning consists of entirely, but there was some chili powder and possibly some paprika.  My other half, put his potatoes in the leftovers of his sausage gravy to calm down the seasoning.  I just didn't finish mine.  They were hot and crispy, just a little too much seasoning.
4	The vegetarian crepe is my go-to breakfast here. I don't even have to look at the menu. The pancakes are really good too but I'm much more into savory than sweet for my breakfast. I always sub a side of fruit in place of the works potatoes. The taters are great but I feel better about myself when I start my day with sliced melon, grapefruit, pineapple and oranges. It's a nice side of fruit for no up-charge. The crepe also comes with muffin or toast. I like both and It's usually a tough decision. The banana nut muffins are moist and delicious without adding any butter. But the toast (white, wheat, rye or sourdough) is a great compliment to my meal. Such a hard choice, I usually alternate between the two. Either way, you can't go wrong.I always get good service here even when they are busy. It helps that you can just flip your egg to yellow when you need something. It's a nice touch. Instead of trying to flag down a waiter you can just flip the egg and let the service come to you. Good food, large portions, reasonable prices, friendly staff and you can usually find a bogo coupon in the Tuesday edition of The View.  What's not to like?
4	This place has some of the best breakfast in  Las Vegas .
5	We used to go to the "other egg" place :) but since moving farther away from that side of town we started giving Egg Works a try and have been loyal ever since! Coffee is good and I like how the table gets their own carafe so we don't hafta wait around for topping off our cups (much appreciated in the morning). I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there and I try to get something new every time, this last time I had their special with potato skins filled with egg, cheese, bacon pieces and topped with sour cream! Sooo good & soooo guilty :-) but hey, breakfast is the most important meal of they day right?!? Banana nut muffins are very tasty but I DO miss the coffee cake sometimes from.. Ah hem Jk Staff is always friendly and fast. We love it!
4	I have been to this location on several occasions and I'm usually drawn there because of a coupon. On this occasion, I had a buy one breakfast get one breakfast free (up to an $8 value) coupon from my trusty Entertainment Book with me. As always, I suggested to my fella that we share a savory and a sweet dish and once again, I was rebuffed. I ordered the pork chops with scrambled eggs, my fella got the sunshine skillet and my mom ordered the classic breakfast with hamsteak. All our food was solid breakfast fare. I have never been a fan of the home style potatoes they serve at Egg Works, so I went with the hash browns well-done. The hash browns were more like hash brown patties, which I was a little disappointed by, but they were actually pretty tasty. My meal was tasty. When we were finished eating, each of us had about half of our meals still left on our plates. The portions are enormous. At this point, my fella finally admits that my suggestion of sharing plates would have been a good idea - victory! This restaurant is great for breakfast treats, just get there early on weekends or you'll be waiting a while for a table. Service is fast and efficient. I'll be back, and next time I'm getting sweet and savory!
3	The food was pretty good and if you get here early enough the wait isn't too bad. They can get really busy for breakfast, so come early. We had a coupon, so look out for those.
2	Sunday Breakfast here we come, and here we wait.... wait ... wait.... for what?  A overpriced average breakfast joint.  Yes big portions, but I do not like the breakfast potates AT ALL!  Its breakfast and to walk out paying $29 for 2 is a bit much i think for eggs and pancakes.. coffee, juice.  Ok so all you coupon folks, I get it... but I didnt have a coupon so my value for what I got was pretty big portions of breakfast food that made me wait almost to the turn of what I should have ordered lunch.  Not a place to stand in line for!
4	Great breakfast place! Its a cozy little cafe, with great service, and a real at-home feel.  Yummy selection and inexpensive.
5	The food was excellent. We were greeted and seated by Kaitlyn... smart businesses employ great hostesses. Great job Kaitlyn. Our server was Dana, and equally spectacular. I had the avacodo omellete with turkey sausage and fruit... excellent. Great food, large portions.... of course the banana nut muffin is a must.
4	I've been coming here for years, and it's my go-to American breakfast spot in Vegas.  I doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu here.  I tend to always go with one of their versions of the "Benny"... Usually the veggie one.  It's a bit off the normal Vegas radar being located in Summerlin; however, if you feel like trying something new and are out of town, go ahead and make the trek up.Wait times can be lengthy, but well worth it.
5	To be a good breakfast place, you need 3 things: (1) good food; (2) GREAT coffee; and (3) good service.  Egg Works has these covered.  I live and die by the South of the Border Skillet.  It's off menu, so I am sharing this little nugget with you because I am a regular here and know the secret menu.  You can thank me later.  From the minute you walk in the door here, it's like stepping into a breakfast joint in Gatlinburg, Tennessee (aka the #1 vacation spot for rednecks east of the Mississippi).  I think this is the look they are going for considering all the hokey decor.  I love it!  The hostesses, servers and bussers work together to make sure you get excellent service.  Each table has a little sign on it that you can use to alert your server if you need something, but you won't need to use it because the service is just that good.The only downside is I could sit for an hour just sipping coffee, but this place is too busy to do that.  When I see the line out the door, I feel too guilty.  So get in as many cups of coffee as you can before turning over your table.  I like to take half my breakfast to go for the next day, but if that isn't your thing, be sure to order the half portion offered for most menu items.  These breakfasts are built for lumberjacks.
4	Always a solid breakfast choice. While there is usually a wait on weekends, turnover is pretty quick, and the wait is not long. It is busy, but they get people in and out!  The menu, printed on newspaper print, is about 10 pages long, with lots of omelette and egg concoctions.  They also have pancakes, waffles, french toast, and lunch/dinner options. It is set up like a diner with very simple decor.  I've tried a few of the omelettes, the pancakes, and the french toast and everything I've tried has been tasty- with large portions! I usually need a to-go box and can make another meal out of my leftovers.The potatoes are yummy! Seasoned very well (a little overly salty for my taste), diced, crisp but not dry or crunchy, and lots of them.  The meal starts with a warm banana nut muffin, which is delicious! Today, I tried the Stuffed French Toast, which is like a french toast sandwich- stuffed with cheesy eggs scrambled with your choice of meat. I am sure I didn't eat it correctly, because I "unstuffed" the french toast so I could eat it separately. The egg/cheese/meat (I got sausage) was great, but the French Toast was just okay. It was a bit dry and thin.  I think I might have fared better had I ordered things separately.  My dining companions loved their meals- a Bandito Scramble and the Strawberry Cream Cheese French Toast. Everything came out piping hot (which I LOVE).  Coffee was great (they will provide a carafe of it so you can fix your own refills), and they had a variety of creamers on the table as well as sugar, equal, and splenda. Service was great! Our server was friendly, funny, personable, and quick.  They have a system where you can just flip an egg (a little plastic egg on a stand that's on your table) from black to yellow if you need anything additional.  They had everything you could think of on the table, though- from hot sauce to jelly to butter to ketchup. I left full and happy- so EggWorks met my egg-spectations!
2	My boyfriend and I just moved to the area a month ago and have been to this location twice.  Both times were during the week so we didnt have to wait at all, which was nice.  First time, I was very impressed with the variety of things on the menu, although it is a little pricey, I figured it would be worth it.  I was somewhat right.  Everything was delicious and the portions are HUGE.  I didnt like the seasoning on the homefries though, but it was alright.Second time around, we get this server who has one of those, overly fake, I secretly hate my job but act like im so happy personalities (Im a waitress as well, So I notice these things)  I loooove waffles so I figured theirs would be great, unfortunatly it was nasty.  Tasted like plastic, and I enjoyed the whipped cream more.The reason I am giving such a poor rating is because both times we went they brought out the wrong food.  Although both times it was corrected, It's just sad that it wasnt even busy and they just seem so unorganized.  For the price of the food, its really not worth it.  Dennys or Ihop would suffice.
4	Yummy food. Good service. Clean place.
4	A cozy family friendly breakfast spot. Reasonably prices and excellent food. Banana nut muffins are delicious. Staff is very friendly.
1	I am a regular here, and I am sorry to say that this place is slowly going down hill fast! The food is okay, but the service is awful. When you ask for toast well done and you get stale bread, the server should not serve it to you. I don't know what has changed, but I will no longer be a regular there.
4	Great breakfast joint!  I eat here a couple times a month.  Their eggs benedict is yummy and my daughter loves loves loves their breakfast potatoes. Fast and friendly service and great food.  Their banana nut bread is YUMMY!  My husband loves it because he can get a beer for breakfast :)
4	Absolutly a great choice for breakfast
3	Alright, I must admit that I hate eggs. I know, I'm weird, and yes, I see all of your hateful stares! I have met 2 other people who hate eggs just as much as I do. I don't know what it is, I CAN eat eggs in fried rice,  and I LOVE egg rolls, but I just can't eat eggs by itself. Nonetheless, my husband loves Eggs Works, so you may find me here quite often. I appreciate that they have items on their menu that doesn't have eggs. Although, I would stick to the breakfast dishes because the one time I ordered a burger, it was very dry and tasted horrible. I usually order Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy. Sometimes they drown the two biscuits in their sausage gravy, but it tastes good and is not too salty or watery. The works potatoes are also very addicting, although I feel that sometimes they give you too much of that as well. It makes me wonder how much  they end up throwing away everyday? My husband loves the Island Favorite because of the Portuguese Sausage, and Egg Works is a much closer drive than going to downtown. Usually service is average and quick, but our visit today was just horrible. First of all, we waited about 20 minutes for a server to take our order. Second, they screwed up my order. I ordered my usual, and our server said "it comes with works potatoes, is that ok?" I replied yes. Then she asked "would you like to add any eggs or meat with that?" and I said no. Another server delivered our food, and when I saw my small plate with just one biscuit with gravy, I told her that it was missing the second biscuit and the potatoes. She informed our original server, and although she apologized, she just seemed very confused. Apparently she thought that I wanted the side order portion. Funny, the side order doesn't come with the works potatoes. Also, she should have known that because she asked me earlier if I was okay with them. Really? Then she told us that she wouldn't charge us for it, but she did anyway. Well, at least she only charged us for the price of the side order. We also had to wait 20 minutes for our bill. What a disaster! This was the first time we experienced something like this.I'm sure I'll be back again whether I like it or not, lol. Hopefully we will get a better server next time!
5	This is my favorite place to eat breakfast at in Las Vegas. The food is amazing, the service is great and the coffee is spectacular. I almost go once a week I love it so much, either Saturday or Sunday mornings. Even though the place gets really packed they'll accommodate you fast, you will usually wait 15 mins tops if is that busy.  Their omelets are delicious and they have variety so I guaranty you will find something you like. Oh! and don't forget to order a banana muffin with your coffee ;)
3	I like to come here around 2 for a late brunch on weekends.. Any other time they are usually busy. But make sure to get here before their last seating at 3. Everything here is pretty good! I love their chicken tortilla soup & banana muffins. I usually either get a bacon avocado omelette which comes with their yummy potatoes or a spinach berry salad with grilled chicken. The portions are good and the service is nice! Nothing TOO special but definitely better than Ihop & Denny's~
4	was so yummy....
4	I'm not an egg fan but my husband could live on eggs.  We wanted to try something new and decided to give the Egg Works a try.  They were relatively busy for a Sunday morning but we were seated rather quickly and our server acknowledges us within 3 minutes.I ordered a skillet breakfast, delish! their Works potatoes are cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic on them. My husband got an omelet with three kinds of meat in it. (yes, he got yelled at for such a poor choice). If you don't like cheese, don't order anything with cheese on it.  Both our dishes had tons of melted cheese piled on, which was awesome.  Service was just ok. The server never asked how our meal was  after it was brought to the table and since the coffee was bitter i wanted water. Finally had to flag her down halfway through my food to get a glass of water.  I also waited and waited to get a box for my muffin.I'm amazed at the lack of face time restaurant managers give. I saw a manager once during our 45 minutes to an hour there when a table's order was wrong outside of that, i never saw a manager again. I would return again but maybe not on a Sunday morning when they're so busy.  I'll give our server the benefit of the doubt and say that's why the service wasn't stellar.
5	As the dog jumps up on the bed, my brain screams out in agony. Opening my bleary eyes slams sunlight in from the window. I want to pull the pillow over my head to shield myself from the world, but the dog insists. As I roll over to try and fall to the floor gracefully, I realize that I'm still wearing my clothes from Saturday night. My shirt is drenched in sweat and twisted sideways and my right arm is asleep.After shoving the dog out the door, my belly growls and my head pounds. I know there is but one hope to salvaging the day. After a full glass of water and a small handful of aspirin, I wander out to my car and find my way to Egg Works.Parking is always a bit of a challenge on Sunday mornings, but fortunately not today. I park around the corner and stagger to the door. Just inside, I'm greeted by the glorious smell of breakfast goodness and a cheery hostess. She asks my name and surprises me with an estimated 5 minute wait. I take a seat on the bench by the window and try to look a bit less disheveled (unsuccessfully)Moments later, the hostess calls my name and I groan a bit as I stand to follow her. My table is a two seater by the window, a little too bright for my sensitive eyes, but that's not their fault. The menu is a newspaper filled with lots of breakfast, and lunch options. I choose quickly from their list of Bennies (several variations on the classic Eggs Benedict) To help easy my pain, I also order coffee, which is left in the carafe on the table should I feel the need to chug four cups before my meal.Now hang overs are just your body's way of slowing you down so it can catch up. The critical components are hydration, caffeination, and nutration (or nutrition if you like) Egg works can help with all of these. One special shout out to the potatoes, which should be illegal due to their addictive flavor.One other note, y'all don't have to wait until your shakin off the effects of Jager bombs, or returning from Sunday services to come by - the service is fast enough that you can swing through here on your way to work, school, DMV, voting, airport, etc.Oh, and if your wondering, I did survive that day, though it did make me pause for a few nights before I could look at anything served in a tiny glass or with a twist top. I've probably not learned my lesson, but then again, Egg Works is always ready to nurse me back to human.
5	I Love this place!!! outstanding customer service, good food, very upbeat, manager walks around and greets customers :)))
5	Popular place on a Sat morning! The wait was quick. The staff was friendly. The selection was great! They were willing to make substitutions for me. Food was quick. Our waiter was Awesome!
4	Just like its sister restaurant, Egg & I, the food is great if you want breakfast.  This one also has a bar, which is great when you're eating along.  The Banana Pumpkin pancakes and Carrot Cake french toast are worth the trip (only available in the fall).
1	My husband and I went here on a Friday morning for breakfast and it was packed. We thought this was a good sign, until we got our food. I had a waffle with bananas and scrambled eggs and bacon. I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it. We won't be back b/c of the quality of the food.
4	The food and service here is great. Everything is fresh and delicious, but for breakfast food it is super expensive. Why should an omelette cost $14. Is this the Aria?
5	LOVE this place!   Went this morning with my daughter and we've been going now for about a year (maybe 6-8 total visits) and they all know us and great us nicely.  Nice and warm environment.  Food is amazing!   Period.  Decor - who cares. Never really noticed, but it's about the food, service and cleanliness to me.  Wait time - this can get ugly at times, but hey, a great meal is worth waiting for.   Highly recommended.
4	Breakfast with the grandparents? Go to Egg Works!Hungover? Go to Egg Works!Gotta take the kids out in public? Go to Egg Works!Family-friendly casual style dining that post-Jager bomb college kids can also appreciate. Really enjoyed watching both demographics fill up the joint on a Monday morning before Christmas. Perhaps there were some vacationers in the mix, but for the most part, it seemed like a locals joint.Probably the best thing about the menu is the wide variety of dishes, anything from healthy scrambles to cream cheese stuffed French toast. Which do you think I chose? Damn straight I had the French toast! Ho ho ho... gettin' that Santa belly ready! My parents leaned on the other side of the spectrum, taking their bran muffins to go for a snack. Since when is bran ever a snack, btw?Waitresses are as sweet as the strawberry topping on my giant plate of goodness. Definitely the "sweetie" and "hun" crew. There's usually about 2-3 lovely ladies taking orders, cleaning plates and running food, so tip them for their hard work, folks. Solid breakfast food served with a smile and some syrup... What's not to like?
5	This place is really good!! The food is too much though for my stomach..which is a personal problem that has nothing to do with this place, but yes its good LOL
1	Worst service I've received in Vegas. The food was alright (had an eggs benedict, nothing special) but it was pretty cold and thus, soggy when it arrived. When I told my waitress , she gave me attitude about how she brought it right out. She never offered to replace it or at least heat it up and stopped coming by completely after I spoke up. She never brought out a refill for my drink, and then threw my bill at me at the end. When I asked someone else about paying, they told me to go up front. I told the hostess about my horrible service and they told me my server was a manager. Obviously couldn't complain, then, as I'd just get more attitude (if she'd bother to talk to me at all). If you're into soggy, cold eggs benedict, then be sure to avoid the surly curly haired "manager" with drawn on eyebrows. I sure won't be back.
2	came here after reading a reviw in the lvrj about their good chili burger.  i'm not a chili burger fan but i do like cincinnati chili coney dogs.  the menu says it's served on a "fresh, steamed" bun.  the kitchen must have missed that description because my bun was cold and hard.  the chili was ok but just missed the mark a little.  they do load to dog up with a heap of shredded cheese but the cold cheese cooled down the dog a little too much.  also, it's a mixture of several cheeses (i prefer only cheddar on my chili dogs).  i also ordered a side of fries.  they only offer seasoned fries (which i'm not a fan of).  i ate them but wished for just some plain ol french fries.  i sat at the counter so service was quick and efficient.
5	LOVED my experience here! The food, atmosphere and service was amazing! As soon as I walked in I felt so welcomed and cozy, like I was having breakfast at a friends or something. Mugs are already on the table. And the mugs aren't like your dainty little coffee cups that you have to keep asking refills for, they're cute mugs that have their logo on it.  The menu offered so many options and it took us almost 10 minutes to figure out what to eat.  I eventually decided to get a skillet and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Goodness. The portions are HUGE!! Definitely one of those, save half for lunch kind of places.  The skillet was sooo good. Melted cheese on potatoes, avocado, ham...my oh my.If you check in here, you also get a free banana nut muffin which is definitely worth a try! I love banana nut muffins and the ones they make here are pretty top notch. I would definitely come here again, if I wanted to get away from the strip and have a relaxing breakfast.
5	Egg Works is our favorite! Great food, sweet staff, and a family-friendly atmosphere. The potatoes and banana nut muffins are especially delicious!
5	This is a great breakfast place.   The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful.  Enjoy the coffee.   Really a great place.
5	Great food! Haole Loco Moco was just fantastic as was the Santa Cruz Breakfast burrito! Yummy!
4	The service was a little slow but they were busy. Cute theme. W were originally going to egg and I but they were temporarily closed so they sent us here with a couple coupons. Breakfast.was good and it was affordable. We would go back
4	Solid option for breakfast. The portions are ample. Prices are good. Nothing really sets this restaurant apart from other breakfast spots though. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Egg Works does what they do well, which not every restaurant can claim. It's consistently good or great, but not amazing or excellent. Nothing wrong with that.
2	Just not very good.My chili omelette wasn't very good. The potatoes weren't very good.The sausages seemed like they were under-cooked.The biscuits and gravy were mediocre and the eggs my mom ate were too greasy, which made her sick.I love breakfast and have been to quite a few places.Unfortunately, Egg Works doesn't really come close to being a quality establishment.I can easily think of 5 breakfast restaurants that serve better food.Unfortunately, none of those restaurants are in Las Vegas.
2	So I literally just left this Flamingo location in a bad mood. As my boyfriend & I walk in, were warmly welcomed with the nice hostesses. She seats us at a table that still has tip money from the last customers & no table set up. I believe we had no particular server because the busser ends up taking our drink order after seeing us not being taken care of yet. Few moments later, a server asks us for our drinks orders again. Then after that, a separate server asks to take our food order. Many minutes later, no banana muffin or food has been delivered. I ask for vanilla creamer which I never received. They must not have food runners either because my boyfriend can see his food sitting in the window. In a rush, 45 minutes later, I ask for take out boxes when I finally get my waffles. They gave me runny eggs when I specifically said over-medium. After my boyfriend boxes up our food he finds a hair on his plate. It couldn't have been his because his head is shaved. Towards the end, I asked if we could have lids to take out syrup home for my waffles. I never received them.When I asked if we get banana muffins with our meal, the server said "only if it comes with the order or if its your first time." Now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one asked us in the beginning? As a server myself for a different restaurant, I know asking the customer if it is their first time is one of the first things you ask when you greet them. I gave Eggworks 2 stars this time and not 1 because I still do enjoy their food. They're always busy so they should be used to the fast paced environment. We were easy customers who knew what to order immediately, did not complain verbally, & STILL tipped them. As an Egg Works fan, I'm really disappointed and hope they can improve their service, cleanliness and communication.
4	we had a car and gf wanted to try a breakfast place because she needs her french toast.probably a 15min drive from the stripi ordered the waffle, light and crispy. was hoping it was a little bit more dense. came with 2 baconsgf wanted the french toast but she decided to go with the banana bread french toastshe liked it alot but couldnt finish it because it was too dense. so of course i had to finish iti ordered a side corn beef hash. pretty damn good. had a southern twist to it when they added some peppers to it. not the typical type of corn beef from a can. pretty damn good hash i have to sayleft very satisfied. great portions, reasonable priceand a plus, had 80's lite rock playing on the radio. SWEET!
3	Not great but not terrible. Just run-of-the-mill quality food at typical prices. The food isn't bad tasting, but it surely isn't the highest quality. On the flip side, it isn't trying to be. Egg Works embraces its mediocrity and prices appropriately.I will almost definitely eat here again because eating eggs is surely healthier than being lazy and eating donuts, for example, but the food is just okay, and the 3-star is labeled "A-OK" by Yelp! so that must be the one I have to pick.
4	Went for breakfast this morning and did not have to wait which was a good surprise. I had the HUEVOS RANCHEROS OLE- A flour tortilla layered with refried beans, melted cheese and two eggs any style. Topped with salsa and sour cream. Served with our famous ranch potatoes. The BF had the CHILI RANCHEROS OLE- A flour tortilla layered with refried beans, eggs, your choice of Works chili or Cincy chili, cheese, salsa and sourcream, served with a side of Works potatoes.Both were really good but I thought the serving size was small for the price. I love ordering Huevos Rancheros in restaurants. It is always different no matter where I go, but usually good.
4	A great place to have breakfast. A gem of a place to share with friends and family from out of town, where a "go to" breakfast joint is hard to find. They all have been thoroughly impressed and surprised that Vegas has more than gaming and the Strip to offer. The country fries are extremely tasty. The muffins are on par with Bouchon at the Venetian. The country gravy is just perfect as country gravy can get. Room for improvement would be: 1. Have the servers take the bill and payment for processing instead of leaving it to the patron to go all the way to the front of the entrance there there is usually a line of people trying to pay. For those of us who are busy, having a morning breakfast may be the only time we spend with the family until dinner. Therefore, it takes away from the quality family time at the table for one of us to  have to do what most servers at other restaurants already do. For those who are busy schedules and are trying to squeeze every minute we can with the family, it feels like if we were asked to go pick up our order from the kitchen when our number is called. It is annoying, especially when the food is as good as it is.
4	Let me just say how in love I am with this place. Not only is this place conveniently located up the street from me, they actually serve delicious food.  I came back here multiple times and tried out different things off of there menu.  Upon arrival I was seated in no time which I am always a fan off.  After taking a seat, not only was my drink order taken but so was my order.  I always research what I want to eat before actually going to a restaurant.  I was also pleased with their website, offering an online menu.  It just makes things super fast for me.  Within the last few weeks of being here, I've tried their canadian bacon eggs benedict, prime rib eggs benedict, and the crepe omelete.  All of the above were delicious and saucy, the potatoes were to a crisp and they were spiced up perfectly.  My orders came in a timely fashion and I always pay the right amount.  A well done deal for such a tasty place. If you're in the neighborhood check them out, because dammmnnn they are tasty!
4	Overall a very good breakfast place. It can get crazy busy sometimes, but I actually find the waitresses to be more on their game when it is that busy. If we go after the craziness, they are sometimes less attentive for some reason.I always get the same thing, the Eggs Benedict, and it is pretty much perfect every time. I say pretty much, because I had to learn to ask for them to poach the eggs medium, otherwise you get a runny white, which is gross. Runny yellow, yes, running white, ewww. Potatoes are delicious!Hubby always gets the three pigs skillet, which I think they recently renamed but he loves it and there is never anything left on the plate. Price wise, it is very reasonable for Vegas. We always get out of there for less that $30, (20% tip included) which I feel is a good value for that kind of breakfast. We have been many times over the years and bring out of towners here, so we would definitely recommend this place.
4	Good food, great atmosphere.  Enjoyed the visit and the good customer service.  They have an egg place card you can flip if you need anything, which is a great idea.  Coffee is a little weak.  4 stars great place for breakfast.  Plus I used their wifi to post this.
3	A wide, modernized-American style space, nice air, nice people, good vibe. Egg Works definitely has a good feel to it, which I think is absolutely critical for a breakfast place. The morning has to feel good, especially for the unfortunate noon-waking types. The staff is friendly, though not spectacular (which they have the potential of being), but they do work efficiently and cleanly. The food is nothing too special; a little too rich, even for American food, and there's the unnecessarily huge servings of thick, saucy food even if you're expected to have morning-dessert afterwards. You could easily split an entree with someone else, and be happier in the end for it for not feeling so mayo-greased. I did appreciate how fresh the vegetables were, and the solid arrangement of the layers in my eggs benedict (which is important), but then the excess food and servings is just such a huge turn-off, especially when the flavors are so monotone that it all eventually becomes one huge unnecessary mouthful. What I'd like to see is some more use of those excellent veggies and construction to create a bit more interest to the breakfast dishes. I'm not saying that they should be doing culinary acrobatics here, breakfast place and all, but they could stand to reduce sizes so that guests are not one-flavor-drowned, or to add a bit more interest to these huge dishes to warrant them being so size expansive.
4	Love the potatoes!
5	Sunday was my first time at Egg Works and let me tell you their food i amazing! There was a 5-10 minute wait which i don't mind waiting that typically means the place is well known for its food! I ordered the Fiesta Skillet and a cup of Orange juice, the food was great the service was fast and plenty of energy from the customers and the staff running the food. I will definitely be back to Egg Works this weekend!
5	It has been months since we were in Vegas and we stopped at Egg Works on our way to the airport and the wife is still raving about the Banana Nut French toast.  I believe if we lived in Vegas we would have gone there another dozen times.  The wait was about 15 minutes to get sat but well worth it, service was fast and friendly, the menu had a good variety of unique items, and the food was tasty.  As mentioned the wife loved her french toast, I got the Chicken Enchilada omelet and a bloody Mary, both were very good.
5	Our favorite local breakfast stop! Great for kids too. Always fast service.
2	benny eggs... sauce was ok but it was missing the "umph"potatos were yummy
4	Great breakfast spot for comfort food. This is not the place for anyone looking for low calorie cuisine. Pancakes and omelets are great. You should also ask for the muffin. It is banana goodness.
4	Their breakfast is eggcellent I enjoyed the Santa Cruz burrito with their special Santa Cruz sauce. I mean thinking all of the possibilities using eggs in every dish. There was something missing in the burrito and I think that there was no salsa or beans, the chorizo was there and it was good but they could of pack it with more flavor and add sour cream in it (on the side is good which I had). I only visit this place once and I would like to explore and try most of the egg dishes. Until next year...
4	Great place for breakfast.  Order you eggs or omelet any way you want ..... what more can you ask for.  I do wish that the omelets where a little fluffier and the coffee a bit smoother. Service is good .... remember it is a breakfast place.
3	This was my first visit for breakfast using a BOGO coupon from a local newspaper.  They were located on W Flamingo Rd/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.  They had a cute Egg Flip card if you need something at your table.We were brought warm banana nut muffins on a small plate.  It tasted more like bran than banana.  There was butter on the table.My friend ordered the California Crepe.  It had diced bacon, sliced mushrooms, diced tomatoes, guacomole and Swiss cheese with a side of Hollandaise sauce.  The crepe was not thin like a French crepe.  It looked heavy like an omlette.  She asked for unseasoned potatoes.I ordered the Works Skillet.  It had a layer of potatoes covered with ham, bacon, sliced sausage links, mushrooms, onions, peppers and tomatoes, melted cheese and over easy eggs.We paid at the counter and presented the coupon.
1	Hadn't been here in a year, so thought we would give it another chance.  I ordered the California Crepe and partner ordered the Bandito Breakfast ( I think it was called that.)  When I think of a crepe, I think of a very thin, pancake like batter rolled with filling.  When my "crepe" came it was like a pancake omelet.  It was huge, and very thick "breading"!  I thought the waitress brought the wrong item, but no.  It tasted "heavy" and was greasy and "doughy"!  I could only eat half.  The Bandito breakfast, (or whatever). Looked like dog food.  It did not look appetizing!  It was cooked too long and "crispy"!  It was not fully eaten either!The only redeeming part of breakfast was the smattering of fresh fruit and banana muffin.  I ordered fruit instead of "The Works" potatoes, as I remembered the potatoes were dry and salty.  (They still looked that way!)Service was just okay!  We did not have silverware, we had to ask.  Waitress only came to table to bring the check.  No refills.  She wasn't very friendly, either!  Sourpus,  There are too many other good breakfast venues in the area, so will be hard pressed to return soon!
4	I love coming here, their food is delicious and the portions are big. Oh and they have the BEST banana nut muffin!!!Here is my first not so good experience or maybe it's just that I'm cheap, IDK....So I came here for breakfast 2 days ago and ordered a kids orange juice, at the end of our meal I ordered a refill, (which they do not have on OJ) like most places do and that's fine. Anyways, when I got the bill I got charged $6.50, I was like holy shit!! that's expensive but mainly because I ordered a kids beverage not a regular size glass, I mean for that prize I can buy my own damn gallon. I just think for a kids drink it shouldn't be that much, that's all I'm saying.
5	Best french toast ever!!! And best potatoe salad ever! Me and my boyfriend love coming here for breakfast. Were always happy when we leave. We've tried many entrees and have always enjoyed whatever we picked. Yummy hot chocolate! always on point. No complaints here! Service is great too. Delish! :)
4	Ah, breakfast--the most important meal of the day.Egg Works is fantastic. This place is hustlin' and bustlin' full of energetic servers, large portions, and loyal customers! The food was hearty and delicious. Nothing at all went wrong! The only reason I took off a star is because, personally, I wish the atmosphere felt a little less rushed (lots of people = lots of noise). I think I would have enjoyed my dining experience if my surroundings weren't so busy. I mean, I would understand it's always packed because everything is delicious, but a normal noise level would have been nice.If you don't mind that bit, this is a 5-star place to go for breakfast or brunch!
5	I LOVE breakfast!!    And Egg Works is one of the few places you can get an authentic Hawaiian breakfast (rice, eggs & hamburger patty, spam or portuguese (WOW A+) sausage).The banana nut muffin has a BIG top on it...the BEST part!!  Moist & fluffy towards the middle and nice crispy around the edges.  it's really more of a bran muffin than banana nut.  I'd call it a banana-nut infused bran muffin....except that'd be too pretentious for this casual joint.   I usually eat the top & leave the muffin.We've been several times and there is almost always a wait...deal with it.  The food's worth the wait.  They hustle people through tho so we've never waited as long as they've estimated.  And if you're a party of 2, the bar at the back is great... the service is best there and it's not quite as noisy/crowded as the dining room where people are on all sides of you and servers are bustling around non-stop.The bloody mary is ok, a little weak IMO, but for $6 go for it.    And I think the portions are HUGE.  Bring an appetite.  If they have the breakfast nachos on special, it sounds odd, but sister ordered them & said they were very yummy.   The stuffed french toast looks out of this world (& huge!), but I always order the Hawaiian...maybe one day.
4	Sheesh! I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I came across Egg Works on Groupon looking for a good place nearby for bruch. Right off the bat I knew it was going to be good by the long lines out the door (any foodie knows that's always a good sign). Walked in the hostess took down my name and despite the large volume of people in the restaurant she told me the wait was only 10-15 minutes. Not bad. It gave me time to check out the menu so I didn't mind. As soon as we sat down the kids got crayons & an activity sheet so they were occupied which made me happy (it's the little things that make such a difference). Our waitress was very helpful. She even took the time to explain the different types of eggs, recommended a few of her favorite dishes when we couldn't make up our minds. We ended up getting the bacon & onion skillet, corned beef hash skillet, and bacon waffles for the kids which they split (oops, I forgot to take a pic). The corned beef was great. I'd recommend that for sure. And I don't even like corned beef so that's saying something!! The kids waffles were just okay. Nothing special. Probably should've went with the French toast. The bacon & onion skillet was very tasty. I'll probably order that again. And those potatoes that come with just about every dish...WOW! They were so good. I was actually pleasantly surprised how much I liked them. All in all, the prices are fair, staff is very friendly and the food is great. Definitely coming back. I'm going to take my parents when they are in town next month. I have a feeling they will love this place too. Side note: The noise level in this restaurant is pretty loud which makes it great for families with little ones. If you're a parent you know what I mean
4	Very good breakfast (Mexican omelet) and employees were welcoming and friendly. I will diffidently return on my next trip to Vegas
3	My daughter so funny... I was complaining I needed a refill and she goes here mom and changes the happy face on the table to a sad lol this place normally has good service, but when it gets busy it goes south... The banana nut muffins are to die for though!!!
3	We came on a Saturday afternoon.  It was packed but we were seated pretty quickly.  I should have gotten eggs.  I had the strawberry cream cheese french toast.  Strawberry cream cheese was weird.Honestly, I will probably try a few other breakfast places before I come back here.PS.  Lots of kids.
1	Awful service! Like are you fucking kidding me. Our service literally rushed us to leave our table right after our food was served. Not even 5mins pass by she forked us the our bill and asked us if we were  ready leaving already.  Like really. We haven't taken a couple of bites. Never again. Plus they over salted the eggs. They take fucking forever for refill in drinks.
3	3.5 stars. I got their Hawaiian breakfast. It was so good!! The portions are large too. My husband got something with pancakes, sausage and eggs. He liked it, but wasn't blown away. They gave us a banana nut muffin that was amazing. We both loved it. Place was crowded. Service was fast and friendly. We would come again.
5	I love this restaurant and location. The staff is nice and the food is delicious! I got the veggie Benny and the holendays sauce was sooooo good. (sorry I know I spelled that wrong lol) I reccomend this place to anyone who loves eggs!
5	My husband and I just got back from Vegas and I felt compelled to Yelp The Egg Works on Flamingo.  We stumbled upon it  as we were driving around my in-laws' neighborhood. Our server was Adriane and she's the reason I wanted to write a good review.  She was very warm and chatted us up a bit about our stay.  She's one of those servers that make you feel like you're home and you just know she's going to give you good service even though the place was very busy.  Adriane suggested the Loco Moco and my husband told her to pick anything off the menu for him.  He loved her choice.  I needed a few little sides and Adriane remembered and brought them out with a smile.  We never had to ask for anything, she was on her game.  Now, we will always choose a local breakfast place over a Vegas buffet and this location of Egg Works will be on our return visit.  Nice staff, good breakfasts, and great service.
2	OK so first off this is a very popular place when I ate here it was very busy. In fact it was so busy I felt like I was at some government service office. Screaming babies lots of people cluttering the aisles. When i first came in I went to use the restroom,there were a ton of un-bused tables not very attractive or sanitary. My waitress was  helpful but over the top fake customer service. Now to the food....why doesn't anyone know how to make a proper hollandaise sauce? Powder mix all the way,average bordering on not really good at all. And the potatoes they serve,omg.They had more salt then the dead sea...easy with the salt moses your killen me. I felt like i was getting hyper tension with each bite.Then I go to check out,lady behind the counter doing something counting receipts finally looks up at me and says how are you,im fine. she goes back to doing what she was doing...lol ..ok np ill just wait for you dear. Please give me five singles as my change ,she hands me a 5...here take this 5 and put it towards a new hearing aid.....this place might be ok to soak up a hangover but other then that mediocre at best...pass.
5	Service is awesome, and just when I thought I couldn't be happier the food arrived... our new breakfast joint.
5	Great breakfast place. I had the recommended corn beef hash with eggs and others had spinach egg bani. It was all around good. Service was on point as well as overall experience. If I lived here in Vegas I would visit this place again.
5	I love this place for breakfast. Staff is always friendly and food is great.
4	The staff is very friendly although they did tell me repeatedly that I wasn't going to get my change back if my total is less than the groupon we were using... lol thank you but I wasn't expecting any change. I'm posting this review because the whole wheat waffle was absolutely terrible and hopefully someone who was thinking about that option see this before hand :) think.. tasteless cardboard. . And turkey bacon wasn't all that grand either. Everything else tho!! Was great :)
4	We went here last week with a groupon and based on the line outside, I knew we found a great breakfast spot. Despite the line, we got seated quickly and were greeted by our server immediately.There was so much yummy options to choose from on the menu that I was overwhelmed! I decided on a veggie omelet with artichoke cheese. Unfortunately, I forget the name but . It was fabulous!! And the potatoes were amazing. We came back two days later and I got the same thing. I will definitely branch out after seeing everyone's amazing pictures on yelp.Great place and a good deal considering we had a groupon. Excited that they are opening another location closer to us!
4	I love how you can order then pick up to go! A little pricey ($20 for two meals) but overall pretty good!
4	Great place for breakfast! They have the best potatoes!! My husband absolutely loves their French toast sandwich. And it is delicious. Place is always busy but gets you in in a timely matter. They also give you large portions.
5	Forget IHOP this is the place to go. Great service and food. I love their potatoes! Very old fashion breakfast style!!
1	Had the chili relleno omelet, recommended by the waitress. Very over cooked and thin, a couple of canned chili's in the middle, way too much cheese. I believe the cheese was thicker than the omelet. It was topped off with some canned or or jarred taco sauce and a dollop of sour cream. Only potatoes they had were frozen tater tots or potato "shredded" hash browns, which looked exactly like a McDonald's hash browns. I ordered rye toast which was some type of rye/pumpernickel swirl that tasted like neither. I had wanted pancakes instead of the toast and potatoes but this was not a option. It would have cost me an extra $6.25. No thanks. The only saving grace was the coffee tasted good but was $2.75 for a small mug, with the thermal pot left on the table; pour your own.Total with tip was $16.06 with a 15% tip. To top it off, they have an improper ventilation/hood system in the kitchen for I walked around the rest of the day smelling like I worked there. Sorry, cannot recommend on any level, except maybe coffee to go.
3	Stopped in here last week for breakfast and was disappointed. It is not the outstanding breakfast place that I was let to believe. The banana nut  muffin was not even close to those served by Mimi's.  Their omelet was not fluffy at all and fell short of those served by The Farm Aliante or the Cracked Egg
5	Our server Amy was awesome!! She recommended the egg works fruit platter with unlimited coffee which we don't drink so she changed it to tea. It was amazing =]
5	The best banana Nut bread Ive ever had!!! I live in LA and I'd drive here for the day just to get some bread and mimosas !! Along w more amazing good food ! Nicole is an Amazing server !!! So sweet and patient. With a smile !! Good service ! Love this place
5	The banana nut bread is the BEST!! Breakfast is scrumptious!!! Service is GREAT!! Nicole & Koko are WONDERFUL, very patient & friendly :)... Oh forgot to mention we come here from LA :-)
1	Sadly today this location FAILED. To be clear they comp'd the meal, yet this major mess up must be called out because it is inconsistent with the normal good job Egg Works has done every other time.After waiting 45 minutes for food and seeing others seated after us being served, one of two meals showed up. It was wrong, having cheese on it. With a tight timeline the person ate it.On the second me the waitress apologized that it was not started. To be clear the waitress, Rea, was awesome. She placed my special order correctly, yet the kitchen just FAILED to do their job. I said to cancel the meal because we had no time to wait.The manager Koko was great as well apologizing numerous times. The food showed up while she was there and it was wrong. The kitchen could not read the freaking slip!!!! The manager stated the main chef was just arriving at 10:00 am on a Sunday morning abd would handle it.It is obvious from the running around in the kitchen that this crew needs retraining or continous supervision. Better yet how about the main chef get in at a reasonable time for such a busy Sunday am crowd.I will give them another try in the future, but they must fix this crew.
5	Alohalani is a wonderful Server.  She had the kitchen create a really great breakfast.  Exactly as I ordered.Very nice atmosphere, very good food.  I will be back.
5	This place never fails me. They have the best banana nut muffin and food ever. The workers their are AWESOME, from the time you walk-in to the time you walk-out they are always smiling and making sure you are well taken cared of. Our server was Aloha and she was GREAT!!! Although we had a difficult order and lots of substitutions with each plate, she made sure each order was perfect and just right. Not one of us were disappointed. I highly recommend this place to anyone because they will not do you wrong. Food is the Bomb, Very Clean, Workers are Awesome, Definitely will return for more!!!
1	Can we talk about how shitty my experience was just now! I had to wait 10 minutes before I finally got out of my seat to go ask someone for a server to take my order. She comped my coffee... Big deal... My breakfast came with coffee anyway... Now I'm still sitting here after I've been done for 15 min waiting for a Togo box.... Thank you Amy for the shittiest breakfast experience of my life. NEVER COMING BACK!
4	The banana nut muffins are enough of a reason to come in.  Lots of selections to choose from for breakfast.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy but the gravy was SO salty that I had to send it back and get something else.  The eggs and everything else seemed fine, a little heavy handed on salt for the potatoes as well though.  The server was friendly and food came out quickly.  Will definitely go back to try some other items but will definitely ask for them to lessen the salt content on my food.  This place is always packed so they are definitely doing something right!
4	Closes at 3, be sure to get the banana nut muffin!! If you want to get away from the buffets and have a good breakfast this is the place to come. They have different skillets, omelets, pancakes, and waffles. Mmmmm my friend got the enchilada omelet I think...it had this delicious red sauce that he ordered an extra side of. Its amazing how much food they give you too. He ordered a half order and still had half of it left over. It comes with these cubed seasoned potatoes. They were good but I wasn't as much of a fan of them as he was.....although I did eat every morsel on my plate. I got the sour dough toast but wish I would have got the banana nut muffin. Mmmmm they are homemade and just melt in your mouth. They aren't too sweet and and have just the right moisture. Luckily I stole some of my friends so I got to sample them. I ordered an omelet with spinach and some other veggies I don't remember in it. The eggs for the omlette were fluffy and light and just melted in your mouth. This place is great and one thing I learned is next visit I'm gonna be a little less safe and order something different for an amazing experience. The skillets really looked amazing as I watched the waitress bring them out. Ohh service was impeccable, very responsive and attentive without that constant hounding feeling. Thanks Egg Works!
3	I used to LOVE their banana nut muffins. But it isn't quite the same anymore... everything is okay... but nothing special.Its about $10-$15 per person for breakfast. Coffee isn't great. Service isn't bad, but nothing to rave about.
4	I love this place!  It would have gotten 5 stars out of me, but they don't serve real hash browns. They serve patties.....frozen. That really bums me out. But everything else is really good. Had the pleasure of being served by Bambi.  Im sure I wasn't very original when I asked if that was her real name. But if she was annoyed, it didn't show. She gave me awesome service and was a pleasurable personality, especIf they get real hash browns, I'll change it to a 5 star. Ask for Bambi.
5	This was my first time at EggWorks!  Our server was Rea.... what a great girl!   Friendly polite and knows her stuff and coffee pot left on the table! My husband loves that!   The food is egg- ceptional!  Lol.. can't wait to come back!
1	I heard about this restaurant from a friend and thought I would give it a try the other morning. I walked in and was greeted immediately and walked to my table. A gentlemen stopped and asked if I would like some coffee. He brought me the coffee and poured me a cup and left. The coffee tasted bitter and cold and just plain awful. I looked around and waited....and waited...and waited...someone finally stopped and I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said she would send coco? right over. The young lady walked to what i presume was the manager. the lady was texting on her phone and never once looked away from it to even acknowledge the server speaking to her. When she walked away the manager still stood in the corner on her phone for what seemed like forever....i chose to get up and leave because i felt extremely dismissed and won't be back #feelingfrustrated
3	I went here for breakfast and I had the strawberry and cream cheese french toast. It was alright but nothing to run home and tell mama about lol. The two things I really did enjoy were the potatoes and the syrup they have me with my meal. Our waiter was awesome and I had a pretty good time here.
5	This is my new go-to breakfast spot when I am in Las Vegas with the girlfriend. We have been here three times and the food is consistently great and FILLING! The service has surprisingly been good every single time. Employees walking around with smiles on their faces. Employees saying "thank you for coming, have a nice day". I have gotten the same thing all three times. Why? Because it is simply too amazing to get anything else. I get the 'Original Breakfast Burrito' which is stuffed with 4 scrambled eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, onions, cheddar and jack cheese and is served with a huge side of works potatoes and very delicious salsa. I can finish this whole plate in one sitting but if I do I feel disgustingly full and ready to explode afterwards. Finishing all the potatoes and half of the burrito leaves you very satisfied and then you can take the other half of the burrito home with you for a second meal.My girlfriend gets the 'Stuffed French Toast' which is scrambled eggs and sausage or bacon with cheese stuffed on French toast and topped with powdered sugar and maple syrup. And served with a huge side of works potatoes.Yummy yummy in my tummy and we will continue to go back here every time!
4	Great food!  Quick service, friendly staff.  You get money off if you like them on Facebook!
5	Still my fave place 4 years later... I still love my breakfast burrito but I alternate it with the scrumptious Chili Relleno omelette!!! If you ask for "light seasoning" on the potatoes, trust me, much better!!   The hubby still favors the Corned Beef Hash. It's ALWAYS busy but the service is always great and prompt! Occasionally the local paper has a coupon, "Buy one, get 50% off" the second entree.
5	The food here is amazing, as our server Rea was.,then again all the servers are friendly- they were trained well.   Fast & friendy service. Food is hot and delicious and sooo many choices. Usually eat there a least once a week.  Look for the 1/2 off coupon on second entree in the paper. Highly recommend.
5	Love the ciabatta breakfast sandwich! Also Sarah was very friendly and nice! The staff is always friendly and great atmosphere!
5	Food is good and the service is great, our server was Sarah amazing service looking forward to our next visit
5	Went to breakfast here with my fiance and we received fast service. Food was great and servred veryquickly. Our Servier Nicole was on top of serving us and making sure we were not needing or wanting anything else. Thank you!
5	5 star breakfast great service by Darlin.
4	Every once in a while my wife has been dragging me here and I have chiefly disliked the enormous quantity of food you get with a single entry. Today, when we were ordering omlettes the waitress asked us if we would like them with 2 or 4 eggs. We said 2 eggs and therefore got a reasonable size meal. (They also came with potatoes or fruit and a muffin or toast.) The smaller option wasn't on the menu--it was a couple of bucks cheaper--and, possibly, the waitress only offered it to us because she sized us up as seniors. However, getting a reasonably sized omlette makes this a much more attractive place for me. I found the veggie omlette quite good and with two eggs right sized. The selection of fresh fruits was also good.
5	I go here for breakfast often! I love the food and the service! Our server Nicole at the ft apache/flamingo location was awesome!! She was super nice and made sure we were have a great time!! Also Veronica at the rainbow/215 location was amazing as well. I felt bad cuz the rest if my party was running behind and we were holding up one of her tables but she assured me it was ok. They were both amazing!! Definitely my go to breakfast spot!!
4	Great breakfast place! Device was great. Don't forget to order the banana nut muffin instead of the toast.
4	I love this place. It's my favorite breakfast spot in all of Las Vegas. And I'm not even a breakfast person. The staff is really good with the flagger egg thing they have. The menu is absolutely adorable. The food is always fresh and served sizzling. What more can you ask for? I'm the two hundredth something review. If an establishment is getting that many reviews, it must be good.
4	THANK YOU again fellow Yelpers!Hampton Inn powdered or whatever their eggs are just won't do.Egg Works, well, works!  Super speedy seating, ordering and food service.I placed a breakfast order with a few special requests, all of which were fulfilled perfectly.Definitely going back tomorrow!
4	Great breakfast option in SW Vegas. Breakfast is standard but good. Burgers are above average. Service often leaves something to be desired unfortunately. They respond quickly to the sad egg on the table though if you have problems.
5	Had Loco Moco, biscuits& gravy etc. meal was very good, service was fast, and we never had to ask for refills
5	Best breakfast place for locals in LV! I recommend the Cincy chili omelette. Especially if you already know & love the glory that is Cincy chili. Their potatoes & fries are amazing. Do yourself a favor & try this place if you're looking for a new spot for breakfast/lunch. I'm in love!
5	I've been here multiple times. Possibly my FAVORITE breakfast place in the Southwest! Service is always great, food is always outstanding, and the prices are just right! The potatoes are always seasoned to perfection! I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to come back :)
4	First off, we ordered coffee and water.  And points are given for leaving a pot on the table for us. The service was very good. She was very friendly and courteous.  Lots of great menu choices from traditional breakfast to a few "Hawaiian" options. Personally,  I went here for a skillet...chose the country fried skillet and it was great! It comes with toast or the banana nut muffin,  hands down winner is the muffin. Served warm. Not terrible expensive for the amount of food.  2 skillets, extra toast, extra egg and 2 coffees about $35I would definitely go back!
4	The best place to go after Sunday church. Or before church lol every item of the menu tastes delicious. I really wish the place was a lil bit bigger bcause it does get very crowded at times & the wait can be very long. I like the staff.
2	I love breakfast. I love eggs. This place has probably the lowest quality mass-production factory eggs Ive ever had.  I ordered the "portuguese sausage" plate & it definitely was not portuguese sausage. Very low quality, super greasy & tastes nothing like the real thing.  The couple stars are only because our waitress was very nice & timely, and their potatoes are seasoned & cooked pretty well.
4	I've eaten here at least 15 times. My only complaint ---not enough space!  Aside from that...they serve everything you need to get your day stated off right. Waffles are solid, not too dense, love the veggie Benedict and breakfast burrito is awesome. Oh and endless coffee, how can you complain???! I've never been disappointed. Must go.
4	Pretty good breakfast spot. I don't know why but their menus (newspaper style) annoy the crap out of me. It's like reading a newspaper that's been sitting in the rain. Gross. Standard breakfast flair. I had a salad but my friend had a parfait and it looked soo tasty. Presentation is a little awkward if you want to eat the granola with the yogurt (in a long skinny glass) so I'd recommend requests a different playing. All in all, it was a solid experience.
5	So much good food. We all took home half of our plates. Recommend the fries over the tater tots with anything. The banana muffin that comes with the meal was tasty and huge too!
5	My server Amy was the best!  Great service !  She needs a trip to Disneyland! !!!The banana bread french toast is the Bomb!
5	Great value great service great prices - I'm a regular here and it's never been short of 5 stars. The staff HUSTLE here - hard working and customer service orientated.  Love this place.
5	First time here and our expectations were a little high from reading all the other reviews. Our expectations were met!  This place was a little crowded and the seating is slightly cramped but it's well worth it. Guess you'd call it cozy. Service was great!  Quick and friendly. Never waited for anything. Cabo breakfast burrito was amazing!  Haven't  had a breakfast this good in soooo long!
5	AMY won my heart with her superb customer service. Brilliant food and excellent customer service.
5	Delicious homestyle breakfast with The Works!!! Perfect "PICK ME UP/WAKE YOUR @$$ UP" FOOD!! Staff are attentive and customer advocates. Rec'd complimentary coffee while I waited for "to-go/take out" order. Very intuitive! TV's at the counter so u can catch up with the news/sports/gossip/BS, etc... :P A must try for *Eggceptional breakfast eggsperience!! Must have the Banana Nut Muffin!!!! Check for Groupon/Yelp deals!
5	I work third shift and got home from work in the morning and asked my girlfriend if she wanted to grab breakfast. I was really craving the works potatoes. We were sat immediately, and our server Timothy was quick to take our drink order, I asked for suggestions with alcohol since it was the end of my day, Timothy was able to name an ample amount of drinks. After our drinks came we were ready to order. Food was great, service was even better.
5	Rea was awesomeness!!
5	Rea, thank you for the great service, recommendations and conversation. I loved the banana muffin.
5	Came in for Father's Day breakfast, service was great. Our server Karen was great, very quick and efficient. Food was great as well!
5	I love love love this place !!  Great service and tasty food.  A big plus to the delish banana muffins. I always look forward to getting.  We just moved here from Cali and this is by far r fav breakfast place !  Good things to get is the works omlette and the stuffed French toast my hubby likes
4	Great location and a local institution. I have been going to this egg works for probably 10 years or more. Yeah its not as spiffy and hip as Hash house a gogo.But they serve large good portions at really great prices.Their pancakes are wonderful, Waffles...especially when ordered with meat inside are heavenly. All of their egg dishes are great....the standard comes with 4 eggs ( get your lipitor ready...ha).Never had a bad meal here and they can accommodate  large parties.Be forewarned weekends are crazy busy here!
5	Everyone was so welcoming n so nice! Our server Bambi was fantabulous!!! Haven't had a server go above n beyond for everything in a long while n she was super accommodating n just such a wonderful server!!!! We have egg works closer to our house n have gone there numerous times but coming here just made it stand out. Wish this location was closer to our house but will definitely be coming back!!
5	EGG WORKS IS AMAZING! I haven't even had a bite of my food yet and the customer service is phenomenal! Michelle our waitress was so happy to be there and serve us and explain the menu to us! Love it! Even if the food tasted bad( which it didn't), I would have stayed and gave them 5 stars. Locals and tourist alike will love this Las Vegas Breakfast joint! It's a must eat for those just wanting to have good food and service. Thank you Egg Works!
2	The service here is wonderful and everyone is super nice; BUT the food is mediocre at best. I LOVE breakfast and this place just doesn't satisfy. They do have AMAZING banana but bread muffin and their potatoes are perfectly seasoned #yum but Pancakes & French Toast are nothing special. Bacon is thin and greasy (it's the thickness and quality that are lacking grease is to be expected); sausage always comes pink and undercooked. Syrup can make or break you and I think it may be the syrup that throws me. I'd recommend Original Pancake House over this place any day and they are right around the corner.
5	The sundance special was amazing & good coffee. Solid breakfast place, Robert was a great server everything came out correct and fast.
2	I used to love this place, but they really cannot make pancakes.  So much batter that the short stack pancakes are each over an inch thick and you can barely find a blueberry. Stick to the eggs and French toast here.  Pancakes are not a good option.
5	Whenever I go to Egg Works, which is often. I always want Chris SanAgustin to be my waiter. He is courteous and very attentive. He greets me pleasantly and even remembers my order, as I always eat the same thing. I believe he deserves a trip to Disneyland! Best waiter ever!
1	Location on Rainbow/215 area. More than once I have been here, sure they're fast when getting seated but after they seat you they take your drink order and you wait 15mins to get it. Then you're waiting and additional 15mins just to place an order!!!! Maybe I'm just being irrational because I have a two year I need to feed and keep entertained.
1	Service was great but the food was so salty especially the potatoes that came with everyones breakfast. I felt sick all day.
5	Great service with the help of Robert who was very informative and attentive,  welcomed us with great service and made sure our experience was awesome. Thanks again Robert. Great atmosphere, food quality is awesome. Free wifi. I got the spinach Benny and the portion is amazing. Presentation is on point and it taste amazing. I recommend this to anyone. They now serve lunch so I will have to try that out soon. The food comes quick and fresh when you order. Received my order within 15 min. And had a party of 7. Great place. And a definite must try! Pruces are perfectly reasonable too. Always will be back for more.
5	Stop through Vegas on a little R & R. I'm a Yelper so I did my search and came across Egg Works Flamingo. Read a few reviews and was convinced that this was the "go to" spot. As my Yelping fate would have it, I discovered the best breakfast place on this side of the country. I received EXCEPTIONAL service from the beautiful Maria G. She was attentive, extremely friendly and provided very efficient service. I highly, highly recommend this place. The people were friendly and the food was absolutely delicious.
4	Today at Flamingo was our first time to any of the Egg Works locations.  Blackened Prime Rib Benny and the chicken club sandwich and Works Chili all rocked.  So did our great server Amy.  We will be back. The muffin is a great starter or dessert!  No one left hungry!
5	WooHoo! is Rite!... this place is great for breakfast and brunch. They offer a large array of breakfast items: pancakes, omelets, corn beef hash and Benedicts and my FAVORITE "HAWAIIAN STYLE" breakfast!. (Spam and Eggs baby!!) but if you really wanna try a great Hawaiian favorite, you have to try The LOCO MOCO. Some places try to have there own style of Loco Moco such as special kind of ground beef patty or special kind of rice. Although, the secret in having a great "LOCO MOCO" is the gravy! Thank you Egg Works for making the gravy wondeful. Such great flavor. not too salty, not to runny or thick but just rite. Lastly, order the egg over easy on top of your loco moco. you will not be dissappointed.Other than having great breakfast food the atmosphere is great. Nice and clean which I like. Especially, the restrooms. If the restrooms are unsanitary, than I second guess about how clean the staff is. With 3 adults and 1 two yr. child the cost of eating was very affordable. Service was very nice and personable.
5	Outstanding service! I ordered half order mushroom omelet with home made blueberry muffin and it was delicious. The price was very cheat for the amount we got.I like the flip cards they had on the table to signal a server to come to our table. I wish they had one in Honolulu, Hawaii
4	Excellent breakfasts! You can get the country potatoes plain but they come with seasoning so you have to ask for plain.
5	I have to say, Egg Works and their other location the Egg & I are Las Vegas sure bets. I have been going for 7 years and each year they open a new location. Their food and service is alway stellar which is hard to find in our city. The bananna nut muffins are the best i've had. I would highly recommend all of their locations.
4	Friendly service, always! Thanks Karen! She has helped us a couple of times even though we've only been there a few times since we're from Southern California. Great banana bread and Loco Moco! Different styles, but Hawaiian is the better one! Fresh coffee at your table! Check the front for their specials!  Be early during the weekends because it gets packed even though it's a good-sized restaurant.
5	Great service and a fun atmosphere! Really affordable, good for a family brunch or a lunch date with friends. They do have vegetarian options as well! Traditional Benedict is what I alway recommend!
5	Great food and great service! Highly recommend the prime rib Benny and ask for Michelle!
5	My family and I love the Eggworks! They always have a pleasant atmosphere and fresh food. If you aren't receiving the service you deserve, flip the egg at your table over and you will be helped right away (very clever).   The food is usually very consistent,  with the exception of the works potatoes (which are very delightful) but can vary depending on the chef.   Our waitress,  Laura C., was cheerful and spot on. Make sure to mention your waiter or waitress in your review so they can win a trip to Disney!
5	Nothing quite like strolling into a local breakfast place, plopping your butt on a stool a the bar, getting a cup of coffee that never gets past half empty, having fun people to talk to and solid food. All of that, Egg Works.I've been to Hash House (pretty much live there when I stay downtown) a lot, and while I do love that place, this local little breakfast nook has supplanted HH.So, as I said, I hop on a bar stool, the manager Gia stops over to throw down on some coffee and ask if I have any questions. Nope. Menu is straight forward, well laid out and my prey is ripe for the picking: The Sundance Special Omelet. What's that you ask? Spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. Right from the menu. But, am I satisfied with all that? Nope, throw in the chicken!!! Opted for the American fries and some sourdough as well.The omelet... amazing. Perfectly done, ingredients all complimented each other and the chicken was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a spicy, southwest style seasoning. The kicker though, the special sauce, having some sort of lime flavor to it, which literally had me doing back flips off the stool. I swear I went into the hunch over the plate to ensure my neighbors didn't even look at it. Sourdough toast was toasted perfectly, not cold and was a perfect vessel to help wreck the omelet. American fries (while I normally opt for hashbrowns, figure, it's a house special, go with it) were incredible. Each spud was crisp on the outside, fluffy inside and hit up with that same southwest kind of seasoning the chicken had. Can't wait to head back and try more menu options. Actually, must head back and try more menu options.
4	I must give egg works plenty of kudos and handclaps because today's dining experience was beyond what I was expecting, in a very good way! I would like to personally recognize Richard, I believe was his name for the world class customer service provided today! My mom and I decided to give this place a try since we always eat at the omelette house and it's close to where we live! Once we got there we were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly hostess! Our waiter was very pleasant and even suggested some of the top items to try and that were often ordered due to popularity. I went with the country fried steak skillet with egg whites and my mom had the veggie omelette with egg whites as well.. Everything was cooked to perfection and the skillets are HUGE so beware if you order any of those! Come hungry that's for sure I didn't finish but half of my plate! I will definitely return!
3	I really like Egg Works! The muffins, the Loco Moco, corn beef hash, hash browns and pancakes are all amazing! The service is typically shitty, but its do-able!
5	Thank you Veronica great service! Fast and friendly service and great food! The perfect breakfast on a weekend morning.
5	Maria did a terrific job serving us! Here's hoping she gets to California! Loved the food too. This was my first time eating there. Amazing.
5	Had a great late breakfast today. Delicious banana but muffins, omlettes came out perfect and Rob was excellent with customer service. We'll be back thanks!
5	Yum yum yum. Everything tastes great. Always fresh. Service is good. Great place to bring your out of town guests. The Eggs Benny's any variety are awesome. One of my favorites.  I try to have something different with every visit. And so far and so good.
5	Food and Service is always great... Kids enjoy the kids menu.  Variety of different games and news piping in on the tv's... A little bit of happiness for the entire family... Food is cooked to order.  Our go to local breakfast place...
5	Ta da! Now that is how breakfast is supposed to be done. My spinach and feta scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection. I don't usually eat toast but I couldn't resist. And I love how they offered the choice of fruit instead of potatoes. Gotta cut calories somewhere! There is a wait to be seated but who cares when you're around great company, conversation and friends for the wait. Now go get you some breakfast!
5	Awesome as hell big menu great choices and they have mimosas and bloody Mary's as well as coffee drinks with liquor ... Second time here I will be back
4	First of all, we've been here several times, and I love this place. I'm actually surprised I've never Yelped it before, however; our receipt said that Yelping will help our server Timothy win a prize... So I'm down. Today I had spinach Benedict. It was delicious. I would've gone for the full five stars, but they don't put enough lemon in the hollandaise. What I totally dig here is: it's always packed, but I never have to wait for a table. Everyone is so cool, and I hope they're serious about giving unattended children an espresso and a puppy. I've also spent time (because of work) in Cincy. So I'm all about Cincy chili. There are several versions of this restaurant throughout town. I kinda like the one on Rainbow and 215 better. They have coffee cake and the flavors change regularly.
3	Not bad for a breakfast spot. We have been coming here since we moved to the area.The skillets are pretty good. Most of the menu items are good. Multiple trips are okayEggs are fairly decent for a busy place like EDubs.Corned beef hash used to be good. Beware!Good kids menu.Get here early or later if you don't want to be stuck waiting.Also, look for the 1/2 off or b1g1 coupons in the local newspapers.
5	Just had a delicious works skillet and some fruit at egg works. The banana nut bread muffin was very tasty. The works skillet had all the best am ingredients and the scrambled egg was light and fluffy. With a great selection of fresh fruit added to it for a little bit of healthy added in. The server Alohalani did a great job of keeping up with us. Will definitely be back again.
5	The place was pack wall to wall people, it was easy to carry on a good conversation and we only had to wait less them 10 minutes.   I had the home made Corn-beef Hash and Eggs, it was awesome!  Coffee wads hot and they gave us our own pot of it.  Highly recommend eating at Egg Works!
5	When it comes to breakfast this is where we go all the time. We love this place for breakfast. I feel sick eating at those other places that come to mind. Here not once have we felt sick or miserable afterwards all day. We feel stuffed because the portions are a lot, leftovers usually. The service is great and friendly (most of the time, as long as they understand, well you know.) I could go on and on with how delicious and plentiful the food is, the items on the menu are a great find as well, lots to choose from, lots, I said, LOTS! You can't lose with this place, if your a BIG eater and breakfast lover, you'll love it.
5	I hope this is the right one, so many to choose from and I am a visitor....  We got a Groupon to try here while we were visiting over Thanksgiving.I got the Cincy Chili Dog and a salad with ranch.  I didn't like the Cincy dog at all, had a couple bites and gave up.  The ranch dressing for the salad wasn't made right so they offered me a new one with freshly made dressing but we had to go so they gave us four (enough for everyone I was with) of the banana nut breads, which were pretty good.Even though the food wasn't that good, they got five stars for service and I would be willing to go back to try something else.My mom liked her chicken salad sandwich, my sister loved her BLT but my son says he didn't really like the tuna melt, even though he took the rest of it to go.
1	After arriving here based on several Yelp reviews I thought I'd give this place a try w/my family. The waitress seemed pleasant @ first but preoccupied & obviously didn't get my order correct, the 1st, nor the 2nd time. Upon receiving the sandwich, it was quite bland in taste & full of lettuce & tomato more so than I'd expected, lowering the quality of the sandwich. My husbands breakfast tasted much better than mine & he was more than satisfied, along with one of my daughters. Which are in the photos on my profile.However, only after we left did my other daughter reveal to me that in her Fruit Parfait that she ordered, she bit into something "crunchy" and when she pulled it out of her mouth (I recall her quietly getting up from the table & excusing herself, not saying a word & the rest of the day not eating anything) she said she saw an eye & part of a little head.. She was so disgusted & threw up in the restroom & was so mortified she didn't know what to say or do..? She didn't reveal this to me until later after we'd left so there was nothing I could do except write a review about it. I have "no" idea what it was or what it could've been.. But I do want others to know..
4	The potatoes are awesome. End of story. That's all you need to know. I went with a family friend the other day, and she encouraged me try something new. I had wanted to order a hamburger because I'd been watching a ton of Gilmore Girls and they eat a burger in almost every single episode. So, I ordered the chicken cordon bleu skillet. It comes with potatoes on the bottom; chicken, ham, and cheese on top, with 2 eggs on the very top. I really wanted to break my egg yolk, but I was scared to what would happen to the taste of the food. I did get sourdough bread as my side which was not that sour. I prefer sourdough to be tangy.We did order a banana nut muffin which is famous. It was pretty tasty, and I don't normally like bananas. It was delicious and warm! The potaotes tasted super yummy! They were flavorful and nice and crispy. I would definitely go back for the potatoes alone!
5	Very busy place! Excellent service, above expected. Blueberry pancakes were very yummy and perfect for a cold Las Vegas morning. Fresh OJ - tasty. Everything tasted fantastic. Nothing but kudos for this cafe.
5	We went here for breakfast on our last day in Las Vegas. It was a Monday morning and quite busy! Our server was fantastic. I wish I had taken his name to put it on this review! The food was delicious! Portions were bigger than other breakfasts we had eaten in Las Vegas but I wasn't complaining! We left there suitably stuffed!
5	Although the wait can take awhile, it is WORTH IT. My fiance and I stayed in Las Vegas 4 days, and ate here 2 mornings in a row. The red velvet pancakes are to die for. The eggs benedict options are great, too. I loved this place.
5	A colleague and I stopped in here for breakfast prior to our first sales call that morning. WOW. We had the best service friendly, fast, attentive and food that was freshly cooked and delicious. The prices were good too very reasonable for Las Vegas.I had a typical bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast breakfast, but there was nothing typical about it. The bacon was quality product and cooked just the way I like it. The hashbrowns were seasoned well and very tasty.My collegue had an omelet, and he was equally satisfied with his choice.Highly recommend this place!
4	Good food. Fast service. Well priced. Tenikia, our server, was super friendly and nice.
5	Consistently good, I get the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet with unseasoned potatoes and Over-Easy eggs. Eggs came out perfectly and gravy was on point. I love that they leave the pitcher of coffee with you so you never need to ask for a refill. I sat at the bar since there wasn't a wait for it and Nicole was my server, she is fabulous. Smiling the whole time on top of all of her section an A+  server (other than being a Cowboys fan). My food came quickly and the order was correct. I will definitely be coming back.
4	Great neighborhood breakfast. Their banana muffin really does change your life, my family loves it. Their pancakes are soft and puffy and just melt away in your mouth, the deliciousness I tell you. Anyhow, staff is accessible and helpful. They make up for the line you might encounter a Sunday morning when it's their rush hour.
4	Favorite place to get a good wholesome breakfast! Forget IHOP, forget House of Pancakes. This is the place to be. Love the cajun fries that come with almost anything meal. And the bacon avocado omelette just melts in your mouth. Great spot to hit up for Sunday or any day of the week
5	Been at this location 3 times and had Robert as my server. He provides great service and recommendations. Would love to be seated as his tables every time I come here.
4	Superior service. We called in an order at the wrong location, walked into this one, and realized our mistake. They rushed our order for us and we were out in 10 minutes. The food is also delicious; eggs benny, country benny, whatever benny, all of them are good. Their potatoes are seasoned just right and they give you a huge pile of it.The only annoyance we experienced was during the American Express Small Business week where we ordered and tried to pay with American Express only to be told they no longer accepted it. Their restaurant was still listed on the Amex site and they made no effort to rectify this.
1	You can't judge anyone by the way you look...Food was excellent! But my server gave me blah service while he was kissing ass to the older ladies by me. Tipping is very important and I base tips by the service. I am very generous because I work for tips as well. With this service, he did not deserve anything. NO TIP FOR YOU!!!   }:(
5	We always come here for  breakfast whenever we're on this side of town. Great food, great people. Plenty of seating. Usually does not get packed.
