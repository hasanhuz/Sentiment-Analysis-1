4	pretty good, but too much smokers in there. the business owner is a good friend of ours. good place, recommended. i haven't been there for a while, but the food i remember is really good.
2	I only like one drink here, but it's enough for me to come in occasionally.  I love their green milk tea, other than that I am not a fan of the drinks here.  The fruit drinks aren't made of real fruits and sometimes they taste powdery.As for the food, there is only 2 things I like.  The taiwanese sausage ( I don't know where else to get this in Vegas) and the spiced pork chop plate is a pretty good price for lunch.I don't like going at night though because that's when all the young teenagers come out...and I hate the smokers too.  I wish lung cancer on all of them.  :oP
4	Well because of the smoking law...no smoking here. Tea Planet is a great place to get different flavors of Boba from Milk tea, hot, fruit, etc. There's a wide selection of different teas. The other cool thing is there's a bunch of tables where people can just hang out and socialize, play cards, read, etc.They also serve food but I've never really eaten much here. My favorite is the Almond Tea. They also have really good ube tea(purple yam). I would like to come here more often but the parking really sucks especially late at night due to Ichiza traffic.
5	I'm surprise about the rating about Tea Planet....it should be more stars....cos to me...is really good...they have a good selection of drinks...I pick different drinks all the time...and is always good...I love their thick toast...and their food is great...I've been to a lot of these Taiwanese boba places..in NYC and SF but this one is my favorite...=)
3	The only thing I like here is the main thing they serve, the boba teas.  I like almost all of them.  Not a big fan of the thai tea here though.  The food is below average.  I wouldn't get any unless you were really hungry, and couldn't wait to eat some asian food even though there's PLENTY of other places right next door to it to eat better food.  There are a lot of younger people who go there.  Hey, at least no smoking though which is a plus for me.  If you're bored, ask for a deck of cards which is what everyone else seems to do.  Also, it's cheaper to order a boba "To Go."  Maybe it's because there's limited seating so they want you to get the hell out of there?
3	Our out-of-town guest was in dire need of some boba before she returned back to Wisconsin.  Seeing Tea Planet all the time after my many jaunts to Ichiza, it was my first time in.  This place is always popping in the late evenings, and it's no exception on a weekday night.We grabbed a table by the window and perused the menu.  It took us all awhile to order since we didn't know where to start.  After getting our orders in, we were able to get a deck of cards so we can be part of the crowd.  The BF and I shared a large Mango Snow Ice ($6.25) with no tapioca.  Good stuff, mostly because it tasted like mango puree.  Our other friends order the Chrysanthemum tea, which came with two tea cups, a medium Lychee Snow Ice with tapioca ($4.75), and a Iced Black Tea.  When ordering the black tea, the waiter asked if he wanted it hot or cold, and he opted for cold.  He didn't expect it to be sweetened though.  It ended up being okay in the end, but took him by surprise when he tasted the sweetness.To grub on, we ordered Fried Spicy Chicken ($4.50) which is deep fried with basil.  The BF and I like to grub on this from various boba places that offer it.  We also tried the Fried Tofu ($4.50), which is pretty basic and comes with hot sauce.  But decent when you want fried junk.  We tried ordering the Taiwanese Pork Pacman ($6.50), but the waiter strongly discouraged us from ordering it.  We ended up with the Fried Squid Balls ($4.50), which is exactly what it is, squid balls!  (Not those kind of balls, duh!)  Food is pretty pricey when you look it over, but you're really here for their beverages.  They also serve random things like Chicken Alfredo Pasta ($7.50) and Squid Jerky ($4.50). The cool thing about this place is that you can chill and hang out.  You can grab a deck of cards and just have a good time.  (Apparently we were having too much fun though 'cuz they told us to quiet down.)  You'll find people of all ethnic backgrounds here as well, which I always think is a cool thing.Service is just okay.  They never cleared our table, so we had to put the plates on the shelf next to us.  We were there for a good couple of hours too and ordered throughout our stay, so that's probably why they allowed our loud selves to stick around.  Overall, I do like places that allow you to hang out and play cards.  Serving some cool beverages and good snack foods to share always makes it a decent place to kick it!Sidenote: $3 minimum per person.(I added pics of our drinking and snacking in the business profile!)
3	It's an okay place if you're under aged and can't get in to the clubs.  It's just your small "coffee place" look but serves boba-tea.  I like the fact that you can sit down and be served.  While waiting, you can play cards and board games since they provide it.  I've taken people here on a first date just to feel them out.  It's casual and not intense.  I can be myself here and just be comfortable.  My favorite drink here is the Lychee Boba Tea with Lychee chunks.  As for the food, it's just okay.  Nothing special but if you're hungry they serve.
2	This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said "Tea Planet" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo.I think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.Our drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea, green milk tea, and peppermint milk tea - they were good though, they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    Their spicy chicken wings were pretty good, I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.This location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks.
5	The selection is amazing, and it's perfect for a late night outing. Lots bring games to play with friends while they're there.
4	I'm the only remaining member of my family that regularly goes to Tapioca Tea Rooms, even though I was introduced to them by my kids when they were teen-agers. The best Boba Joint back then was Tea Planet, as the place known as Tea Station is now called. What makes a good Tapioca Tea Room? A wide selection of Teas, with or without the Tapioca Balls. A good selection of snacks... and the Tea Station provides an ample selection of snacks to outright meals. And an ambiance that is not aimed at the teen-age crowd - the decor will tell you when you walk into Tea Station that you don't have to be a teen-ager to frequent this establishment. In fact, you don't even have to order Tapioca Teas. There is bench seating against the right wall as you enter that runs the entire length of the establishment... with handsome teak tables and chairs that further define seating spaces. Very classy and nice atmosphere.My favorite Tea with Tapioca is either the Green Milk Tea or the Green Milk Tea with Honey... both with Tapioca balls.My favorite snacks are...   Tea Boiled Egg   Chinese Sausages   Fried Tofu   Bean Cake   Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetables   Instant Ramen with 1 Egg   Picked Ground Pork with Rice   Why doesn't my kids like Boba anymore? They're in their mid-20s now and they've graduated (with their friends) to finer eating establishments. The main reason they give is that the crowd at the Tea Station is mainly non-Asian now... to them it has been taken over by a different crowd.After five years of not having a Tapioca Tea from the Tea Station... it seems to me it has definitely changed. I ordered a Green Milk Tea with Tapioca from there right after dinner at Ichiza upstairs from the Tea Station. The wait-staff seems a little older, and a little less friendly. Of course, they could have been mad that there were only two persons waiting on a 70% filled establishment - In the past there could be up to four persons waiting on customers. There is also a rule at all the Tea Stations that a person can't sit at any of the tables without ordering a snack or meal... ridiculous! The crowd is getting a little older also... the age of the crowd on a weekday at 11pm seemed to be more in their late 30s than the predominantly teen-age, college-age crowd back when I lived in Las Vegas. But the ethnicity of the people there at that time of night contradicted what my kids said about the declining Asian audience... over 70% of the people there at 11pm were Asian.One thing hasn't changed, though - the Tea is as good as ever.
4	They were open on Thanksgiving.  Four stars off the bat.  Then again, the Chinese places are the only ones open on Thanksgiving anyway.This is a sister store to TenRen, so you know it can't be one of those awful places where the boba tastes old and crusty...  Mmm.
4	I just got a Tea Planet card after my first trip 4 days ago and we've already gotten 7 punched holes in our card!  Crazy!!  But seriously..love the boba.  I am not into the fried food so much but most menu items aren't bad.  Their "pacman" pork is prob my fav.
5	the milk tea is made from scratch. (oolong tea and condensed milk) vs your normal, made from powder crap you get at your local tap x or quicklys. the boba is fresh, nice and chewy. the mango snow ice is also very good. nice at tangy. made from fresh fruit of course!the spiced fried chicken, (is not spicy), its pretty good, its seasoned well and has a nice crunch, nice small size, and cheap snack.the pork chop fried rice was pretty good. i think the one place i like better than here is sinbala in so cal, but its pretty good here. portion size is pretty good. you get rice with ground pork on top, a big piece of deep fried pork chop (seasoned well), pickled cabbage, egg, and this other cabbage type thing. nice and filling. i also had the green dumplings, very cute presentation of green and white skinned dumplings, they taste the same (whether its green or white).the hot teas are brought to you in a clear glass tea kettle on a tray. all the other boba drinks come to you in huge glass glasses (think like those beer glasses w/ handle, if you get the large size).service was good, the girls working there are cute and nice. our drinks and dishes came out pretty quickly too. decor: i'd have to say its one of the nicest looking tea places i've been to, probably can accomodate around 50 people, pretty clean, and plays fobby chinese music. if you're jonesin for some boba in vegas, you MUST come here. location is pretty fair, its not too far from the strip, its pretty close to wynn and TI.
4	Places like this remind me of how much i miss San Jose and places like Tapioca Express. Ordered a Peach Yogurt snow with pears. larges are...LARGE but expensive San Jose i can expect to spend about 4.50 for one that's just a quarter smaller but here it's 6 bucks. Other then being a penny pinching bastard i can find anything else wrong with the place, will try to come back to try the mango everyone's raving about as well as the chicken.This place is MUCH BETTER then that other Taiwanese place down the road that everyone, employees and customers included give me the judging eyes for a foreigner. Note, i was born in CALIFORNIA and spent an enlistment in the Marines, i also practice my 2nd amendment right by owning a Springfield 40cal so if I am to be considered a foreigner, we got serious issues....:: UPDATE ::Okay just bumped this place up from a 3 star to a 4 star.- The spicy fried chicken wasnt really spicy at all. it has as much heat as a chicken mcnugget+ Finally found something i liked that made me go up a star and that's the Iced Bubble Coffee with pearl- Everyone raves about the mango snow ice i believe, to me it's not bad but i'd never order it again, it tastes too artificial and lots of it.+ Seaweed wrapped chicken rolls are HIGHLY recommended
3	Maybe this place just isn't my cup of tea?Honestly, I'm not much of tea drinker and the food on this menu was well out of my comfort zone, but I was looking to try new things.  Squid jerky was definetly a new thing to try.It's been awhile since I'd eaten seafood, so the taste of the squid in my mouth took some getting used to...as well that it was jerky so I couldn't eat it quickly or swallow...the taste had to linger in my mouth for quite awhile.This business is located just underneath the popular Ichiza sushi restaurant, our first choice for this evening, but with an hour wait, we chose to go to Tea Planet instead.  The smells were excellent when we walked in though I can't quite say what it was; it was quite sweet.  Many young adults or older kids were sitting around playing card games and drinking tea or consuming some type of rice-based food.  The menu is primarily tea in many forms, from hot to cold, mixed and plain.  The food is almost an afterthought, yet what you get when you order something from the menu is a complete meal.  I ordered the squid jerky as an appetizer (or not, heh) for $4.00, my Spiced Pork Slices were $7.00 and came with sticky rice, onions and greens.  It was an interesting meal that I cannot say I totally enjoyed, but did not hate, either.The tea was way too sweet but I could drink it.  My friends drink seemed a lot more enticing with boba and plum in her tea.  Next time I may want to try one of those instead.  The prices on the menu are all quite reasonable.  I would go here again, maybe, if Ichiza had a long wait, but at least I can say I tried something new.
3	Totally cute place with so-so service. I always get my boba tea to go so I don't really take advantage of the cuteness of the establishment.And when I say cute,... it's cute in that Starbucks of boba kinda way.I think this is a chain.I want to say that I've seen one of these in New York.But... whatever.The lychee crushed ice drink was delish.I had the medium and it was actually pretty big.I'd drop in here again after a visit to Ichiza maybe.But I wouldn't make a special trip to come here.
4	The quality of food and drinks at Tea Stations all over has always been consistent among each other. It's pricier than your average boba chain, but you get what you paid for.JONASAPPROVED!
3	Really slow service but great boba the food is okay.
5	I love Tea Station...who doesn't like a cheap rice dish and a tasty refreshing drink to wash it all down. Grew up hanging out at Tea Station with friends back in So.Cal, when I moved here I still come here once in a while by me self....when I crave the taste of minced pork rice with pickled veggies and a large cold honey green tea to cool off in this hot desert heat. I also like the selection of small snack/appetizer dishes....which doesn't break your wallet.
4	This is actually the only good boba place here so far (unless anyone has any suggestions)! I like their milk green tea, and maybe the mango snow ice (although it could be very sweet!). The prices are higher than most places, but it's ok for a better quality of drinks...I've heard that their popcorn chicken is good...They also have lunch specials before 2pm where you can get a FREE green milk tea, green tea, milk tea, etc. with your meal!
3	6 years ago, we did the American FOB thang and flew to Las Vegas to see the Taiwanese and Hong Kong R&B sensation version of J-Lo at the shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center (at ticket prices that would make U2, The Cure, and Radiohead blush), I suppose you can call her C-Lee, or stage name Coco Lee (real name ahem....Ferren Lee, gotta love Hong Kongers who try to get too creative with English names). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Lee(the pic in the link is old btw, you can probably find some more recent material on youtube if you want an idea).Coco is 100% Chinese, speaks fluent English having spent much time in the US since age 10 (attended UC Irvine at some point) yet somehow through vocal training can belt out (in her prime which has sadly past) a voice that almost sounds like Mo Town, and somehow managed to develop some serious badonkadonk that looked like it came straight outta Puerto Rico. So we sat down for the whole show, and Coco had to work on the crowd, most of whom were older A$Ns and younger AZNs who came from more conservative families and didn't seem to have a clue as to how to behave at pop concerts, and needed cues from the pop $en$ation herself that she needed more encouragement from the audience via louder screams, or some AZN announcer trying to work the crowd again at the end of the first set for an encore (when the reverse is true at western rock concerts, the audience automatically goes buck wild for encores without cues). At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing, and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background, sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).So Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan, aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal, Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley. (SGV).We had no set of wheels of our own, so we cabbed it here within less than 10 minutes. Don't remember too much about this place, except the menu mirrors the Tea Stations in Southern California, but not quite the same quality and vibe. My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark, decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint. Then again I'm a bit biased as I'm a fan of Ten Ren, straight outta Taiwan.In the words of a friend, TAIWAN ROCs! (Republic of China lolz).And Coco's a$$ got really big when we saw her again at the Shoreline in Mountain View CA  September 07 (actually we were there for opener Alex To, former druggie who at 40 going towards 50, still kicked a shitload of ass, like a stripper working overtime for that dollar). F******K still the same schtick from her about "I'm so nervous I need some encouragement", "are y'all cuh-rayzee AZN muckafuthas ready to par-tay? Lemme hear ya scuh-reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem b*tches!"At least Tea Planet and Ten Ren are much less predictable than a Co Co show. $ave your money and get some OG Tea $tation sippage.
4	Happiness is...Holding a luscious Tea Planet beverage in your hand!  I was craving a Green Tea smoothie so I headed down to Tea Planet to get my fix...I love this place!There's so many tasty beverages to choose from it's hard to decide, so I guess I'll have to keep going back and experimenting these delicious concoctions!It seems like the perfect place to bring your lap-top and just chill out while getting your Boba on.  The food is pretty darn good too.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did!
4	Good tapioca drinks, well, it's the main thing they sell.A big plus was the food, it's pretty tasty for a boba place.Before 2pm you get a free green milk tea, green tea, milk tea, etc. with your meal, that's an excellent deal.
5	I spent the better part of my high school life here. This place is phenomenal. I have incredible memories here and have loved it forever. This place is open until 2am in the morning, serves the best boba in the city (I will ONLY order taro boba here -- no one else gets it right), and never cares how loud or how much fun you are having. The food is exactly what you expect it to be, made to snack on at midnight, though there are a few other good entree dishes. They will give you a discount for takeout. Favorite place in the world. Would not have it any other way.
4	I love tea and I love boba! This place is the best because they have a large selection of hot tea, iced tea, milk tea...et al and curiously random japanese dinners, appetizers, and desserts. Free Wi-Fi is a plus and it's opened until 1 am or 2 am. I come here when I am feeling very adventurous and asian - there's nothing like drinking a sweet fruity tea concoction while chewing at the same time.
3	This place is ok, prolly the best i think in Vegas, i was reading other reviews and yea Cali does have better and cheaper places for the same amount or price.  This place is usually hella busy, and Ichiza is right upstairs so going on the weekends or during hours where people just got off work is not the best time to go.  Tonight was busy, its not the weekend and it was around 10, but i take into consideration that there is no school for most students.  Service is lacking because its too much for two people to handle, and theres big groups, and no one ever leaves cause they are busy talking or playing cards.  Hey, if theres no parking, you can park in handicap cause no one ever checks.  And sorry to anyone physically disabled if i stole their parking space.
4	I love this place. My girls and I are always here.  Taro balls, snow white snow ice and tea-flavored spiced pork chop are my favorites.
5	Tea Planet - OMG! The only real Tea place in Las Vegas!!!! I frequent here often. Even the food is pretty good here. I like the pork knuckle here. My bf likes the tea flavored chicken and this place is known for their pork chop. I also like to get taiwan ice here. The tea is good; they use TEN RENS. Not all the dishes come with minced pork so you may want to ask for it if that's what you are used to. If you don't see what you like on the menu, ask them. They can make it for you!
4	Whenever I crave authentic taiwanese/HK food, I come to tea station. We had some friends who were visiting from HK for awhile and we came here 5 days in a row. My favorite dish is the tea minced pork, and my favorite drink is the mango yogurt. My bf gets this drink with red bean and a scoop with ice cream on top which is delicious but with a million calories. All the appetizers are fried though. It's a good place to chill, play cards, get a drink and hang out. Totally HK.
2	Absolutely the worst service I've ever gotten. Unfriendly, unattentive & made us felt like we are the most unwelcomed customer ever! But I do have to say their food & drinks wasn't too bad and I might just order togos instead of dining-in so I can still enjoy my bubble teas while in Vegas.
4	This review is base on my first visit to this place. It said Tea Planet here but i dont know why there drink and menu said " Tea Station " , weired !I was craving for some milk tea while i was in Vegas so I decided to try to find a milk tea place over China Town. This is the first place that draw my attention while i was looking for the bubble place.I order a green milk tea which is good , I like how they mix the tea and the milk ratio. The tea favourite is strong. Price is a bit on the pricey side compare to bay area. This place is clean and server is nice enough. Would come back again if i visit Vegas again. Might be i will try some of there food next time.To go drinks got 15%off:)
4	The tea and snack-like appetizers are amazing. I've been here many times, and never had a complaint on the food.The service *usually* isn't all that great. However it generally doesn't take away from the experience.This is a great place to meet up with a friend, grab some tea, and bs about your day.Try the squid balls!
4	This is my 1st time while in Vegas that I am off the strip.  While my brother got off of work, we stopped by this center so he can grab a bite to eat.  I saw Tea Station and went in to grab a milk tea. Tea Station has an extensive menu with a lot of snacks, rice bowls, hot teas and milk/boba teas.The milk tea was great, lots of tea flavor with just the right amount of milk and sugar.  However dont expect too much service as with many of these Asian joints, but heck I sure dont mind when the milk tea is that good.
2	I'll preface this review by saying that I spent a month in Asia recently and was absolutely spoiled by authentic Taiwanese and Chinese food. I also live close enough to LA to drive up whenever I crave good old Asian food. So those who gave this place 4 stars, don't hold my rating against me just because I am spoiled. 4 stars for the tea, 2 stars for the food, our total bill was $60 for 4, so one star for price (given the quality of the food). I would definitely pay more for better quality. We ordered: 1. Tea flavored pork chop -- greasy, fatty, and didn't taste fresh. The rice was not cooked well either, I can make perfectly fluffy white rice with my eyes closed (w/ a rice cooker of course), so I have low tolerance for bad rice. Also, the sour cabbage that typically comes with pork chop rice would have been a nice touch....the veggies that came didn't taste good. 2. Slow-cooked Pork -- not good. Again, fatty and greasy. 3. Lavender Milk Tea with Boboa: VERY GOOD! 4. Rose Milk tea with Boboa: not too shabby 5. iced Green Tea: good Again, using Las Vegas standards, this establishment probably warrants higher rating given the lack of boboa places. I just wish the empty calories I consumed was for better tasting food. Maybe they will work on it and it will be better! I sure hope so!
4	I was happy to see a tea station in Vegas, for my tea craving, I ordered a plum green tea with aloe.  They used real plums, and the tea tasted great.  They also serve authentic Taiwanese food plates and snacks here .  This is probably the best place to get boba pearl (bubble) tea in town.  Minus 1 star for the price and service.
3	There is no reason to doubt Tea Station's plethora of delights. This place reminds me of Starbucks but with  boba or steaming bowls of ramen. This Las Vegas location lacks in comparison to the Alhambra spot, but if you see a Tea Station, don't hesitate to order a mountain of shaved ice and call it a day.
2	This tea station pales in comparison to the one in San Gabriel Valley. I don't know why, but it's lacking totally on the flavor of the taro snow ice with boba. Still a great drink, but not the mind blowing milkshake I had at my first Tea Station experience in LA. The environment is a lacking too, but when I'm just here to pick up a drink and bounce, I am not too concerned about that.
5	I love teas.I love sweet teas.Therefore, I like Tea Station.I've tried the Tea Station in Newark several times, and happened to stumble upon the Vegas location on our departure home. Of course, we had to stop in for a drink.This location was not as packed, but that was because it was around 2pm on Monday. We ordered our green tea with aloe and were on the road! It was yummy, of course. The aloe is very fresh and crunchy as opposed to the canned green tea with aloe bits that are mushier.
4	Ahh Tea Station. The first time I went was almost 10 years ago! This is one of the hot spots for boba in Las Vegas. On the weekends they're open until 1am. The only food I've tried is the pork chops, which is a good portion of food for about $7. The drinks are always good. I usually order the snow white or taro smoothies. I think that most of the fruit smoothies are syrup? The tapioca is the best in Vegas. The staff is friendly, nothing out of the ordinary. The only thing that would get me is when I wouldn't have cash. If you have to use your debit/credit card, there's a minimum of $20, so be sure to order enough!
2	The atmosphere of the place is kind of neat, there are cards on the table and they're open pretty late, so it's a nice meet up place for those who work swing shift. However, in my opinion, the tea is lacking. I like milk tea, sweet and delicious a la Volcano Tea (which is conveniently within walking distance to this place) and Tea Station just didn't deliver. Their milk tea had an overbrewed tea flavor, that nearly choked me. I think my tea had been sitting stale just brewing and brewing for hours. and don't get me wrong, I LIKE strong tea! I also ordered tea eggs when I came in, which were absolutely vile and were untouched after the first bite. I cannot comment, however, on whether it was their version that was gross or whether I just hate all tea eggs. I remember my sister ordering a teriyaki chicken bowl or something similar, and it was also mediocre. Service is bad, you have to chase someone down to get any service, which made me feel like I was more of a burden than a customer. I won't be back, I'll just keep visiting my beloved Volcano Tea.
2	So I decided to try Tea Station today since I was at Cafe Noodle to get some take out.  I had read some of the reviews here at yelp and figured it should to pretty good.  I was disappointed with the place.  First thing was that they don't use fresh fruit in their drinks.  I ordered a honeydew melon snow ice with boba for my hubby and a rose milk tea with boba for me.  Both were mediums.  The boba were good, but I felt for almost 5 dollars for a medium they could use real fruit instead of powder.  Second the service was not very good.  Well, actually the service was good for me but I think not that good for a couple of Caucasian ladies that walked in after me.  The waitress got very impatient with them because they wanted to know if they used real fruit or not and so just kept talking about how annoying they were in Chinese.  I felt that their question was a legitimate question and she should not have started talking about them even if they didn't understand.  I will definitely be sticking to Ay Chung or the place in the China Town mall because they both use real fruit for their drinks.
4	I LOVE the drink flavor options here! Some places are better, but don't offer some of the oddities that I like.List is extensive and I get to have fun with my flavor moods but Taro (blended), Honeydew (blended), Rose (hot or cold), Lychee (blended) Lavender milk (hot or blended) are some of my favorite drinks/flavors.Snackies are alright- fried chicken, fried squid balls are pretty standard, good to snack on. I would skip out on the meals as there's so many options close by tastier and bigger portions for the price. I would rather go upstairs to Ichiza or an restaurant nearby and then go end the night with a yummy drink from here.3.5 stars because they have a $10 card minimum, and sometimes their Asian pop music is a tad too loud. Still it's an alright place to get a cool drink.
5	I tried my first boba tea here on my first date with the boyfriend. I was a little apprehensive at trying a tea with dark little balls in it, but I'm glad my boyfriend got me the lemon green tea with boba. This place was nice and the teas were large and delicious. Perfect for a hot summer night in vegas.I hunted for the right boba place in Los Angeles for over a year, not realizing there is a Tea Station 5 minutes away from home. Glad I live in an Asian neighborhood haha. Anyway, great place!
2	I agree with the other Yelpers, something about this Tea Station doesn't compare to the ones in So California.  I'm not sure if it's the service, the environment or what, but it just doesn't compare.  One thing I did notice is that it's always MORE expensive than the one in Irvine, CA.  I was charged more than the price on the menu and the guy told that he hasn't updated with the new prices.  It irked me a little...I guess it irked me enough to where I have to vent via Yelp about it. It's still good tea. Darn them!  I just like Iced green tea half sweetened...sometimes with boba or without.  No frills or anything.  It's true though, as much as 2 star bugs me to go, it's the only Vegas spot with green tea that like.
4	So many drinks to choose from...I can never decide. They have green tea, black, milk tea, mister T..... The boba is a little hard. The huge drink selection makes up for the poor mediocre quality of the boba. I forget what kind of tea I got with lychee jelly, but it was good. If your drink is too sweet, try ordering it with 1/2 sugar next time.The food is good too, but the portions are small. I think most of the food is cooked with tea. They have free wifi. They used to have playing cards but I think the cards got so beat up that they threw them out. It could also be that they don't want people to stay a long time just playing cards. I always have a deck in my car so it's all good. There are some tables outside so you can chill outside and watch the cars go by.

3	In Cali, Boba places are like Asian Starbucks, one in every corner. The boba places in Vegas has nothing on the places back home in Cali in price, quality, and service, so you just have to drop your standards.Tea Station only really sacrifices in service and price. Its an Asian establishment, so I'm not expecting much in service to begin with. The waitress may forget your boba straws, not be attentive, or seem like they don't want to talk to you.This is probably the most expensive boba place in town, with some drinks starting at $5 for medium! The appetizer can easily go up to $6 or $7, so not a cheap after lunch or dinner meal. However, the teas is what really set this place apart. There is a more apparent tea taste than the other boba places in town and the ingredients just taste better.  I've only ordered the coconut jelly, it comes with an scoop of ice cream on top. Ordering it will make everyone around the table envious of you. The menu # is C66. The others around the table order stuff from lychee to taro to mango. All meeting their approval in the taste department.Tea House probably has the best boba place in town if we're only talking about taste. Service and price could be much better, but if this isn't a big concern for you, this is the place to get your boba fixing in Vegas.
1	We will no longer go to tea station until they decide to properly handle their German cockroach issue. A few months ago my husband who is a licensed exterminator found they had roaches...GROSS. His company has given the onwers several quotes but the onwers are too cheap to handle this serious problem. I feel like calling the health dept!
2	With No 1 Boba Tea just a few yards away , I won't be returning to Tea Station:*No fresh fruit drinks. Just artifical "snowball" drinks. EW.*Rude staff*My mango green tea wasn't very tasty. *The bobas were ok, but I like the hot,fresh ones at No 1. Those hot bobas in a cold drink are so incredible.*$.50 fee applies to use your credit card?! *Insanely expensive. My coworker got a plain milk tea, I got mango , both with boba, our bill was over $13?!?!? Yup, it's more Americanized. Yup, it's "classier" inside, but sorry in the end I'd rather tastier drinks that cost far less. When you're so close to No 1 why ever come here?
3	got some peach green tea with boba! tea was a little on the bitter side, but guess that means they didnt put much peach syrup as other places (less calories...yay!). cost us 9 something for 4 drinks (one reg size and one large)!!! yeah i am appalled!!!ive had some rice dishes here b4. nothing impressive, but a great place to come and hang out. saw lots of people studying and congregating outdoors.
4	I HAVE to go there when I happen to be in Chinatown and I would definitely suggest the "rose" or "lavender" milk tea with boba...Just the right amount of sugar and totally addictive!My favorite boba place in Vegas so far!
3	I liked the Tea Station near where I used to live in Fremont, CA.  And was glad to find another one out here in Las Vegas.  Their menu is pretty much the same as the one I remembered from California.The drinks are good (but again made from powders like most other boba tea places), and the bobas are cooked well.  It is a pretty relaxed and chill place to hang out, get some snacks, play some cards or surf the web while you kill some time.Service is usually good, but can sometimes be rather poor if you end up with a rude server that is most likely a mainland China transplant.What I like about this place:the snacks I have tried have mostly been good (Sweet butter toast, tea boiled eggs, Tea flavored fried spicy chicken-can also be prepared non-spicy).Dislikes:2 waitresses that can be rather rude.Cost less to order the drinks to go, but these orders do not count towards their Buy 10 Get 1 Free promo card.And prepared to pay in cash, or they will charge a small fee for paying with credit cards.
1	Can you say overpriced? I avoid this place at all costs because in all my experiences, I have never felt welcome. The customer service has always been very bad and the staff has always pressured me (and my friends) to order something right away. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Although they serve good boba, it's not worth it. You can find better cafes in Vegas.
4	You think they only serve boba drinks and tea here? Wrong! They have a pretty big menu including snacks like fried taro balls- delicious!!! (We love taro! If you're a fan, you should try it.), spring rolls, and soup. I like the mango hot tea, just enough sweetness. I'm a big fan of fruit teas as well as green tea. Large selection of drinks here- hot and cold. Perfect place for dessert.But if you're trying to have a conversation on a weekend night, it can be a little hard to do that since this is a social kind of place where games are played, like cards (iem noisy) and there is a lot of smoking (not a smoker so this bothers me and sometimes my allergies don't like it either).  Service is good but it's not like they're smiling and happy about being there. At times it can be hard to get a seat on the weekends. If parking is a problem, just park in the back.
4	My favorite place to get boba in Vegas. They stay open fairly late, we have ridden our bikes here a few times. I like boba tea, but I prefer the yogurt drinks. They have a few different flavored yogurt drinks with the boba in it.  I get the apple cinnamon ice yogurt or something like that. It always fills me up.
2	I was expecting more... better... I'm not sure why, but I was. We got a large coffee milk tea with boba and a large peppermint green tea with boba. Hubby liked his coffee milk tea but my peppermint green tea tasted like I had swallowed some spearmint gum. I thought it was supposed to be peppermint? In any case, almost $12 for the two seemed a little pricey. And what's with the attitudes? I felt like I was an inconvenience for asking to place an order. I think I'll go elsewhere for my Boba tea next time.
5	We had the hot tea with sticky rice balls and green beans.  The soup was really refreshing and the rice balls were pretty sticky and good.  I haven't tried the entrees here.  This place is pretty clean and the service is decent.
3	Pretty much standard with the other tea stations. The tea recipe is good and the tea is more authentic than a lot of the other boba places in the area. If you're looking for authentic tea, come here.
2	I'm not a big fan of this place cause the price is too much for a basic milk tea (almost 4$)!!!! The milk tea is too sweet too.The setting is nice though, as there are quite a bit of tables for everyone. Nice decorations with their wide assortment of tea on the shelves for display.I'll take Quickly over this anytime.
5	you people are insane... this place is the MOST AMAZING boba place in las vegas. Number one boba, volcanoe tea, DONT STAND A CHANCE. The waitress there are helpful and very friendly, the place looks clean and really cool. the people there also got rid of the 50 cents extra charge for credit card use. lets just say TEA STATION BOBA IS AWESOME!!!!
4	I give this place such high reviews because I've been coming here since I was in high school. This is, seriously, Las Vegas' only boba joint to just chill and hangout in a cool and big environment ~ the closest thing to California or any other big city you'll get.The service sucks. The food is expensive - albeit - pretty good for the most part. And boba sizes are also overpriced, but you're paying for the experience of hanging out. Flavor of things isn't bad though so that won't disappoint you.This place is one of those long-standing Vegas institutions that usually only locals would go. If you're a visitor, it just might be worth checking out if you want that full local experience. * BTW * they don't accept credit cards unless it's over $20. The closest ATM is Wells Fargo across the street and Bank of America also across the street.
3	In all honesty, this place isn't that amazing... It is over priced and over iced. But I can't stop coming back! This is a good place to catch up with friends and plan where to go to next. Thai iced tea with boba or iced lychee green tea with boba are my staples. They are yummy, but nothing incredible. I recommend getting your tea "to-go" because then you wont have to sit around waiting for someone to take your orders, or to get the bill.. nor will you have to tip;]. Now if you're ordering food, that's another story, and another review (not from me). Perhaps I am drawn to this place because sitting outside on a nice night, people watching, sipping on tea, & planning the night feels pretty good... I guess it's worth the few extra bucks.
4	A treasure on Spring Mt. Thought the teas are a bit pricey, it is STILL just a couple more dollars. I am a big fan of tea. Definitely recommend rose tea with milk. If you get it with boba, suck with caution. Those things are dangerous.
4	Ok, so I haven't had a lot of experience with different tea houses.  I haven't had the need to try anything else!  I've had several of the teas, including the mixed fruit drink both as a tea and blended, the barley boba tea, and the almond boba tea.  I'd have to say that the mixed fruit one is my favorite!  It has lot of pieces of strawberries and apples, and its nice and sweet in a fruity sort of way.  The smoothie version, which I think is better, reminds me of Tropical Smoothie or Jamba Juice, but better!  The service is always awesome here.  The girls are friendly and always willing to help you make a decision (the menu is huge!).  I haven't had the food, but there are quite a few dishes here that at least look yummy, particularly the soups.Even if you don't like traditional teas (like me), or have had bad experiences with boba tea elsewhere, try this place out.  You won't be disappointed with the mixed fruit tea, trust me!
4	Every time I spend time in Las Vegas, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.  Not only do I get to explore really cool hotels, Yelp event venues, and foot massages, but Misti and Bobby Y have introduced me to some really unique restaurants too.During my last visit, I was introduced to Tea Station, and I felt like a little girl in a candy store as I took in all of the tea and snack options on the menu.  Iced Teas, Milk Teas, Iced Coffees, Jelly Ice, Snow Ice, Shaved Ice, Hot Teas, Traditional Teas, Tea flavored Noodles, Snacks, and Meals... I hadn't heard of half of these things before... you see, we have extremely limited boba options in Phoenix, let alone all of those other fun things!I ended up ordering a green tea with milk and boba and it really hit the spot... so I'll end this review with a request to Tea Station: can you please open your next location in Phoenix?
2	Had the almond milk tea and it was just okay.  It was watered down and lacked flavor.  The service here is definitely not the best, but it stays pretty busy.  I suppose you have to know the right thing to order.I prefer Volcano because the the service is outstanding and the boba teas blow this place out of the water .
3	When I first moved to Las Vegas, my newfound friends took me here for some boba. I never knew such a drink or dessert existed until I was introduced by them and I'm grateful they did because I'm able to share my favorites with yelp* and anyone who's ever been will agree with me 100%!Boba is "slimy, yet satisfying" -- (c) Timon, Disney's Lion King.First off, I'll warn you that parking is the biggest problem. When a place gets real popular, parking is always a battle! Parking tip: Right next to Tea Station, behind the east side wall, is Harbor Palace (stay tunes for a review!), is some parking and you can walk right on over to Tea Station no problem! Once you've won the battle of parking, you'll walk in and often times, especially after 8pm, the tables are taken and crowded-- exactly what happens when I wear skinny jeans: TIGHT! They offer a discount of 30% off when you take your drinks to go (good business move and idea!) so take advantage of it if you don't have a party to entertain. Take your drinks and take a stroll on the strip that isn't too far away from Tea Station. If you decide to ignore the 30% discount and stay, grab a deck of cards to entertain yourself while the Asian "baristas" throw your drink together.I came here a few times and a few bad experiences with the service. The waiter tends to get your order wrong if you don't explain clearly what you want or point to the menu.  Should I fail this place in my book if I've grown numb to the bad service I get here sometimes? I'm not the only who's said the same thing, but then again the drinks are the best boba drinks I've tasted here in Las Vegas. Sigh... What a love/hate relationship! What am I talking about again?! Oh yes, Tea Station! Here's a list of my favorite drinks and dishes served! Stick with this list (that will keep growing) and you can't go wrong! Try:*fried taro balls*hot taro milk tea*hot honey black tea*honeydew ice with rainbow jelly*pork chops and rice!Note: Taro is like the potato of the tropics. It has a starchy consistency with a different distinct flavor. Trust me! You'll like it.Enjoy!
5	I got honeydew snow boba.It was the best I ever had.I didn't know the tapioca could be so soft and chewy.The drink didn't flake and clog up like icee either.Then again, I'm from Arizona where they have NO good boba.They treated the customers well and acted like they appreciated their business.
4	The entire plaza alone is a whole different kind of culture just sitting on the streets of Vegas. So I guess it sorta is a little 'get-away' or 'vacation' from your typical ol' starbucks coffee house. What makes it better than a coffee house, is the fact that they serve full on entre`s of actual food too. Usually when I do go, I'm just there for the hot taro tea w/ boba on the side. I haven't come across any other place that serves HOT taro tea.Of course like everything else in an asian-crackin' place, it's SUUUPER packed like UPS. Usually mostly during the evenings tho. But don't let that stop you from trying it.. I mean just being in a crowed room, with people who love what you love is all part of the experience.
4	milk tea, fruit tea.. all good. we ordered snacks like peppered chicken and toast that were really good as well. Wanted to get their shaved ice with tapioca strips, but they were out unfortunately. This is my hang out spot almost every night while I was in Vegas!
3	This is to place I go to for jasmine green milk tea with boba.  The boba is soft and chewy, like how it should be.  There are so many boba places out there where the boba is hard because it has been sitting out too long.  When that happens, it kills the drink for me.  Now talk about the jasmine green tea, it is brewed here.  Many other places have the powder kind, which again, I dislike.  I had taiwanese food here before but only remembered that they all taste a little different, not as flavorful.  I tried the chicken nuggets, and other stuff.  Have not ordered any food here since.Service...They could do soooo much better.  Sometimes, it feels like they don't want our business or something.Until I find another boba joint that brew their own tea, I am sticking to this one.
1	I live in Cali, and I always go to tea station in Cerritos, so I decided to try the one in LV. Bad bad service, one of the guys name is see or ce I don't know. But one of the reason they said they werent welcoming to my cousins and I is cause they were so busy, that shouldn't be an excuse. Aside from that there tea is really really good. Too bad I didn't get one at the one in LV. FYI they only accept credit card if you spend over 10.
1	my first time here at this tea station in Las  Vegas. upon entering no one greeted us or even smiled. no welcome at all, compared to the one back home in Cerritos. CA. when we took a seat. some Asian girl with a pony tail asked us " if we we gonna eat here or to go?", so I said " here". so then she was like " oh were about to close in 10 min", and it was barely 130am!!! knowing that they close at 2! ugh never again!! so glad I don't live here. very unfriendly staff the night me and my family came in Sunday 11.28.10 around 130am!!!! so who ever was working that night, shame on you!!!! also my sister asked some girl with shirt hair why they didnt greet us, the staff told her " because were busy!"!!! absolutely no excuse!!!!!!!
1	Wouldnt be a bad idea to fire all the waitresses and hire all new ones. Ones who dont treat their customers like they're the ones that ripped the heads off all their dolls and spit into the stuffing when they were little.Just wanna copy and paste a buddy's review of this place from 5 months back. ---Elnino F.2 star rating6/10/2010i take it back!!! a business cannot prosper if their employees are snippy, impertinent, and unpolished!!---Yo El! it's 5 months later! guess what dawg. the employees are STILL SNIPPY, IMPERTINENT AND UNPOLISHED!!Yes Tea Station is a respectable chain in CaliforniaYes this location is a franchiseYes the teas and food are quite niceNo that doesnt mean they can treat paying customers like scum when all we're asking for is just a little extra attention.I guess i should put some details in. Okay here we go.It seems every time we ask for the bill they take their sweet time bringing it to us but never want to retrieve it. On two separate occasions i thought about just walking out on the bill and waiting outside to see how long it'll take for them to notice.On one occasion i got fed up with waiting for them to collect the money that i walked up to the register to do it myself. The cashier didnt even look at me, no eye contact, no face contact, no general direction just grabbed the bill from my hand like it was money i owed her, thrust-ed the receipt in my general direction and turned away to avoid more human contact. Not even a thank you.Another occasion the waitress acted like she was a servant that just got called away from her one moment of rest when we asked for more napkins and by her body language and slouch of her shoulders she REALLY didnt want to bother with those napkins but was forced to.
5	i love this place!!! their drink is awsome!!!when i camein, they always know what i wantabout the service, they are pretty nice to me:)sometime they got busy, i will excusedfwhy people complain a lot? if u don't like this place just don't go there then.
4	The girl that took our order is nice and patient. I ordered my fave, jasmine green milk tea, medium size, and it was strong.  Definitely real brewed tea.  I upped a star this visit, and do wish that they keep their service at this level consistently.It was crowded, like usual.  The only thing is that you must spend over 10 bucks before they let you use your credit card, so we have to order another drink that we didn't want since we don't carry cash.  Boo.I will remember to bring cash fo sho next time.
2	VERY QUICK TIP!  If you're willing to experience the worst service ever, don't ever go here.  Don't get me wrong their boba is delicious, and if it wasn't I wouldn't come back.  But the thing that kills this place is the service.  For one, you have to be Chinese and speak the language in order to get some respect around there.  I know the place gets pretty packed sometimes, but they do rush their customers out once they're finish with their boba so others can be seated.  It's something I don't find right, but I get the whole wanting to make business aspect of it.  Today was a usual day of you know, coming in and being ignored until I actually spoke to them to get my order in.  Even when they did so, I always seem to get attitude. For what? I have no idea exactly, perhaps I don't speak their language.  I always seem to get jipped on my Milk Teas, and sometimes I never receive my Taro boba fresh.  I don't understand how people can run a business, with workers that are rude.  This place is lucky to have good boba, otherwise....I would've bounced and gave this a no STAR rating if I could.
4	Tea station is a very Asian chill spot off the strip. They serve Chinese appetizers, noodles, and ice bean desserts. My favorite thing here is the hot brown sugar milk tea. It is amazing! Once you have this, nothing will be as good. It's a perfect spot to catch up with friends.www.anitaeat.com
2	This place has completely horrible service. They come to your table about a minute after you sit down, and if you aren't ready to order - they won't come back for another 10 minutes, unless you can somehow flag one of them down [ but they usually pretend not to see you].Their drinks are mediocre at best. And they don't seem to cook their boba on a consistent basis. They also have a minimum purchase amount for each person at the table. And you get charged a two dollar fee if you don't meet it.The only reason I really go here, is because it's one of the only places in town where you can get boba after 9. Other than that, I wouldn't waste my time.
5	What a great late night date with a friend or even just meeting someone! With the bowls of tea that will last into those late hours. Rose milk with boba hot helps bring a little bit of spring to cold Las Vegas. Brown sugar milk tea is like a big cinnamon roll!! Can't go wrong with this gem :)
3	Ok, I love places like this. I can never say no to tea or boba and together, they're a powerhouse team. I just can't get over how expensive this place is. Not saying it's not worth it, because their creations are good. I just have a hard time paying $7-8 for a drink (off the strip) when I could buy one for half the price at most other places...that are just as good, if not better.I have been to many of the places in this chain of stores. I'm actually originally from around the area that this company was started and headquartered, so I'm quite familiar with this place. The atmostphere in Tea Station is nice. Cool, hip, relaxed. I actually enjoy quite a few of their tea soaked foods as well. They aren't extraordinary, but they offer a solid product in their own right.Aside from the price, this place is a great place to sit and hang with friends. Just be prepared, you will most likely have to beg the servers for their attention or else, just order at the counter. Service can be pretty slow.
4	So I you have "boba" drama and it's a late night, Tea Station is the place.  Although they are kind of expensive and chippy when it come to using credit cards (if it's under $15 they charge you extra), I'm still a fan.  They have some great stuff on the menu so it not just tea that they do here.  Try the pork chop and teriyaki chicken if your hungry.  My favorite tea is the hot mango black tea, it's delicious ;) It's a great place to hang out late night and while I haven't been there earlier than 9pm I'm guessing it's still the same and would be good then too.
3	I have made it a habit of stopping here for boba milk tea on my way home from a delicious meal at hot and juicy crawfish.This place can get pretty crowded, but the to-go line is reasonably quick. I've never eaten in, so I can only comment on the boba. I am never disappointed with the texture or the taste of the boba. The consistency and yummy taste keep me coming back for more.
4	I have to admit.. they are the best boba place in Vegas. However, they probably have the worst customer service - but then again, what else can you expect from a restaurant in Chinatown.love their milk green tea & mixed fruit tea and pork stew rice for dine in :)
3	Good boba. Don't really treat the white folk too friendly sometimes, but I would go there. Minus the awful health code rating and demerits.
4	I really enjoy this place. The floral smell of tea just makes me happy! I am not a fan of boba so its nice to exclude it from your drinks. Just try not to sit by the door because if the door sensors are on you will most likely trigger the annoying welcoming or departing sound. Otherwise the food's yummy and the teas are swell.
1	The drink is good but the food is bad. Comparing with LA store. Vegas store is not good at all.
3	A fine place to get your tea and boba cravings satiated, but there are too many faults in this place and location to barely give a recommendation.Located in Chinatown, the place is apparently a hot spot for the college Asian crowd on my visits on Saturday nights. Parking is atrocious. Tea Station is located in a two-story plaza with several businesses with limited parking. On a crowded Saturday night, expect to circle the perimeter to find that elusive parking spot. Service is so-so and a bit rushed. As for payment, it's annoying how there's a minimum to use your card. Ugh. Drinks are good and food is average. It really depends how familiar you are with tea and other items. I love taro and their hot taro milk tea (without the boba) is simply, going back to 90's slang, the bomb. I like their ginger and jasmin tea. It's a bit strong, though. Prices are a bit high for some damn tea. I always buy the smallest portion available. Food isn't good enough to be recommended, so stick to drinks. Lastly, I have an issue with their bench seating against the wall. Maybe it's me and my bony ass, but it's extremely uncomfortable and hard. They put cushions to mitigate the problem, but it's doesn't work. Bruised behinds aside, it's an alright to place to have a convo with your bff or loved one. Otherwise, I would rather stick to a coffeehouse.
4	As the name suggests, it's a great place for all kinds of tea.  The milk tea here is as close as it gets to the ones in Taiwan.  Although the bubba tends to be slightly overcooked.  I am not a fan of the food here......it's really just a drink and dessert place!
2	Tea Station is a bit overrated in my opinion. The drinks are great, but very expensive. $4.50 for a small and $6 for a large. The food is a bit expensive, but the portions are large. Unfortunately, my Pork Chop was dry and hard to chew. Overall, their specialty is not food. Go here for drinks and a merry time, not to eat.Oh yes, the stupid electronic door greeting system constantly goes off even when somebody does not open the door. They seriously need to get rid of it.
4	TEA:If you want to get the best tea in Las Vegas, this is the place. I tried various teas and they were all good, but the tapioca milk tea is by far the best. If you order teas for to-go, you will get 15% off the price. One tapioca milk or milk green tea will be free when you've purchased 10 to-go drinks in total.FOOD:I don't care for their food. I've had lunch at this place a couple of times with different friends, but none of us liked any of the food.SERVICE:Not so impressive. If you want to chit-chat with your friends for a couple of hours, this place is good because they don't bother you at all. But if you need a regular attentive customer service, you almost always have to ask for service. Without knowing that, one time we had to wait for 15 minutes for a waitress to bring a check.OVERALL:This is the best place for to-go teas.
4	I love going here for the flavored shaved ice.  My favorite is the mango, but it's seasonal.  My standby, green bean shaved ice, is good as well.   This time my husband got it with lychee jelly (without consulting me, btw) and it was really good! Coming from Socal, I thought Tea Station locations were more common.  There were two locations in San Diego.  But actually, there are not a lot of these around and I feel lucky to have one in Vegas.$10 minimum for credit cards.  I bought some hot tea so we could meet that requirement.  Great place to just hang out.
4	Tea Station... since when did they change the name lol. I use to come here when the place was called Tea Planet back in the day. Great place for some delicious milk tea or some boba drinks. Super bombsies, my favorites the honey dew slush with boba, try it. It's also a pretty cool spot to hang out with friends late night and just chill and have conversation over some drinks and cards. Oh and they have pretty good food too try the M10.
4	Stopped by for some boba after dining at Ichiza.  Though it's a bit confusing the first time coming in since everyone was busy behind the counter on the left and it looked like a restaurant.  Stood there a bit bewildered...walked out...looked at yelp again...yeah they serve boba, this has gotta be the place...walked back in and got our drinks and happy again.
3	I came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a small group of friends. I shared a pot of the hot taro milk tea with pearls with my cousin and it was pretty good. The place seems to be hit or miss though as the other people in our group didn't really like what they got. The passion fruit tea/juice was too sweet and the black barley tea didn't taste good. I'm sure there are better pearl tea places out there.
4	The food was great. Although customer service is a bit fuzzy but over all I like this place. They kept me coming back =D
4	My friends and I usually hit Tea Station as a late night hangout spot when we don't feel like drinking alcohol. The service is kind of hit-or-miss with how friendly and attentive your server is. Sometimes they're quick to take your order and bring you your item, other times you have to call the server over before you can place your order, especially if they're busy. The place is usually pretty steady in its number of patrons per night; on a weeknight, the place is 70-80% full, and on weekends, sometimes groups have to hang out for a bit outside before being able to find a place to sit.Some of the most popular items are the shaved ice, the snow ice (taro, or purple yam, is my favorite), and the regular boba milk tea. They're pretty quick to get them out to you too, especially if they have more than one person making the drinks.Their food isn't bad; we usually stick to the appetizer items so that the group can each try some of everything. I've had their eel on rice before, as well as their marinated chicken, but they're nothing too spectacular. I would suggest eating somewhere else and then coming to Tea Station to hang out afterwards, rather than eating here.One last thing: Bring cash; it's easier. There's a minimum $10 charge for cards, so save yourself the issues.
4	Pretty good tea, including hot tea to cold boba drinks. They mix them very well and they have a good taste. However they are kinda pricey but I guess you pay partly for the environment and for the awesome mixed drinks.Ok so about the atmosphere, this place is hella chill, so relaxed its pretty awesome. They truly do not care, as long as you buy something.One time it was a group of 5, two people bought just regular drinks, and we sat there and messed around for about a good hour and a half, and not a word or glance of impatience by the people working there.It is a very chill environment and a good place to just kick it..now here is the best part, they are open to 2am everyday, 365 days a year. including any major holidays. That is such an awesome trait for a restaurant to have. And on top of that they do not alter their prices just because it is a holiday, and I guess that keeps the people coming.Ok enough about that, they also serve food as well, little snacks to go with the boba drinks, but they also serve actual food. It is not the greatest but for a late night dinner or snack it does the job. OH and if you go there for good let me recommend the chicken curry. -delish-
4	Service has VASTLY improved since my last review about four months ago.Four months ago my general attitude of this place was pretty much 'burn it down and build a new one' now it's 'hmm...didnt i use to hate this place? oh well...'So yeah staff is MUCH more attentive to customers despite being full or being empty. They no longer have decks of playing cards available for loan nor a lot of places to plug in electronics for juice but the free wifi isnt too bad.Been coming here enough to establish a few favorites:Mixed Fruit Tea (hot/cold)When it's served hot it could be a little on the sweet side, and the 'omg my mouth is burning but i dont want to spit because it kinda tastes good but holy crap this is causing me lots of pain' type of hot. A nice little perk is if you finish the tea you can open the little pot up and have at the pieces of fruit used to flavor your teaServed cold with boba and you got yourself a treat. Ginger Logan Tea (hot)Got it when i was feeling sick during the winter months. Very mellow soothing tea that tastes a bit like honeydew melon. Again you can open up the pot at eat the re-hydrated logans inside.Instant Beef flavored Noodle with Egg and HamIt's instant noodle with a fried egg and a slice of thin processed ham. It's 5.50. Who in the right mind would pay 5.50 for instant noodles with cheap enhancements. Normally i wouldnt but i cant identify what brand of instant noodle and the cheap enhancements just make it taste so damn good...Will keep ordering only to replenish my occasional craving for sodium.Honorable Mentions:Spicy Chicken WingsYeah 'spicy' is an understatement...Are they really spicy? if you're used to eating Korean food and sucking crawfish and shrimp heads at Hot&Juicy then no these wings are as spicy as a glass of milk. Still they're seasoned nicely and juicy on the inside while lightly crisp on the outside.Been there, Yelp'ed it, Possibly Never Again:Fried WontonsBland, Not a lot of flavor, nothing specialTeriyaki ChickenWhere to start...Chicken had grill marks but very little grilled flavor, also very little teriyaki flavor. The rice and the teriyaki sauce didnt go well together. The rice was too moist and instead of soak in to the sauce it just blanded the sauce up. Looked good in the picture but i'll grab the instant noodle next timeTea flavored Japanese Style RamenYeah...didnt taste like tea at all...Broth tasted heavily of pickled bamboo which also floats around in the soup. Priced higher and larger serving compared to the instant noodle with egg and ham but didnt tastes as good.Spicy Fried ChickenAnother case where 'spicy' is an understatement. The pieces lack consistency. One will be big, meaty, and juicy on the inside, another will be too small and dried out but crunchy, and there's a bunch of others that float in the middle. The breading is a little to heavy and not seasoned enough.
3	the order.milk teagood milk tea and adjusted to taste.boba was not what i've come to expect from tea station.enough to satisfy my boba craving!
4	I enjoy going to this place for tea. their food is decent as well. i usually order the large milk teas. i havnt tried their pearls since i dont like pearls to begin with. for the most part ill just add red beans.overall its a nice place to go and relax and enjoy a snackthey also have free wifi
4	Tea Station is a solid spot in Chinatown late at night when you're in the mood for tea/boba drinks, but other boba shops have closed for the night (*cough* Volcano Tea *cough*). This place is also good when you're in the mood for tea and free wi-fi. It's true that their prices are higher than your average tea/boba shop, but spending a few more dollars to get a tasty drink along with free wi-fi is worth it. Their menu features an extensive collection of tea and other drinks, along with tea-inspired appetizers and dishes such as tea-infused eel and tea-flavored noodle soup. They also have shaved ice desserts that look perfect for a hot summer day. I want to come back to try one of the Hot Healthy Drinks because they look so darn healthy (not to mention the serving bowl looks cool). After reviewing the menu, I opted for the Iced Honey Green Tea on my most recent visit. My first initial sip left me disappointed- the tea was way too sweet- but after drinking more of it, I began to like it more. I've also tried the Iced Hibiscus Spice Tea- a pretty red colored tea that is lemony yet sweet- and the Iced Barley Powder Milk Tea w/ boba (I like the taste of the barley milk tea, but I prefer Volcano Tea's boba). Their hot teas are good as well. On one visit, I tried the Fried Spicy Chicken (located on the Tea Snacks page), which was pretty tasty. I would love to try some of their other menu items on my next visit. Service has never been an issue for me- the servers are friendly and the orders come out fast. I'll be back again when I feel like sipping on tea while surfing the Internet in a nice, clean environment.
4	Boba. West coast boba.We were craving boba after dim sum, so off we went down the street to tea station. I got a hibiscus something black tea, and man, the boba was good! A simple midwestern girl like me...happy with good tasting boba. Who would have thought. The boba was the right amount of chewyness. I mean, don't get me wrong, tea station isn't like your Joy Yees, but still, definitely good.
4	I stopped in here after a busy morning for some tea. It really just blew my mind - I got the Tapioca ice milk tea (with the boba!) and a bowl of noodles. Tea-flavored beef noodles, I think they were called? Both were amazing. The broth was very flavorful and rich, and it had soaked into all of the contents (beef, carrots, noodles) making them both very tender and complimenting their natural tastes very well. The boba in my tea was very chewy and had a nice, delicate flavor. It tasted fresh. My server was quick with getting things out and very polite. I'll definitely be stopping by again!
3	Decided we wanted boba after eating pho and this was the closest place (down the street). We ordered our drinks to-go but they do have sit-down if you wanna order some food. I ordered the Green Milk Tea w/ boba and the hubby ordered Milk Tea with boba. Both were good but kinda pricey for a drink, $6 for large. Service was kinda slow, took awhile for us to get our drinks.
5	So this was a pretty random trip after friends and I visited the Pawn Stars pawn shop (History Channel show) in Vegas. We felt like having boba tea, so we went to the chinatown area. Tea Station is more of a tea house than any tea shop i've been to; they serve all types of leaf/loose teas and sell alot of their own tea leaves to take home. We had:Shaved ice: goodBoba Milk Tea: REALLY GOOD. Best boba I've had! QQ, as they would say in Taiwanese; perfectly chewy and al dente. Most places make them either too hard, or overcook them/leave them out too long and they get mushy. Tea Station's boba was really QQ and had great flavor; in Taiwan after they cook the boba, they'll mix it with some brown sugar and sometimes honey; they definitely did that here too and it was sooo good!Mango Black Tea: Pretty good, but a little too sweet. I'm actually a little bummed that the boba was so good, knowing that I won't be able to have such good boba until I go back to Vegas or Taiwan. Boba tea in LA didn't even compare. Sigh... And of all places to find great boba...
2	When in high school this was where all the Asian kids would go to hang out, order boba, and play cards. They have a different prices for dine in and take out. I like the taste of there drinks, but I have two complaints. One, their boba is a hit or miss. When they are fresh, this place is delicious, but it is the opposite when you get the bottom of the container remnants. Sometimes it was so difficult to chew that my friends and I would use them as ammunition in our parking lot wars. Maybe I should not be complaining because we got a drink and entertainment for the night. My second issue is how expensive they are. Compared to all the other tea shops around, they are by far the most expensive. I like that they do not use too much syrup to mask their teas, but that can backfire when the tea has been sitting around for too long and become bitter. It has happened on a few occasions, but overall their green and black tea are strong and not watered down. The taro slush is my drink of choice and of course one of the more high in calorie drinks. It is rich, creamy and everything bad for you.
3	I enjoy Boba Tea from time to time and this establishment is open late and has a convenient location on Spring Mountain that's fairly close to my workplace.The inside is gleaming, very modern-esque with tables and booths on the floor, tea and sets availble.  Tea Station is actually a chain with this being the only one in Vegas.  Onto the tea! So I like the milk teas a lot.  They're not SUPER sweet but they're rich, tasteful and I enjoy it without the actual "boba" in it.  The syrup teas are all very sugary and sweet so if it's your first time, I recommend an almond tea with a few boba so you can try it.   I would try around at different tea houses on Spring Mountain because one or two of them actually made them with fresh ingrediants and not artificial syrups.  They also have tea flavored snacks and hot treats such as the soups and takoyaki (WOOOO TAKOYAKI!).  Beware, takoyaki is HOT in the center even if the exterior seems cool.  The fried Tofu is also nom nom nom, but remember: this place is meant for snacks and comfort food.  Go get a meal elsewhere but having a quick bite here is more appropriate.You can take your Boba tea to go for a discounted price as well.I do not find the night crew to be anywhere near on par with the day crew.  The day staff is pleasant, talkative, and cheerful.  The night crew will rather forcefully shoo you out close to closing time and is very short and sometimes difficult to talk to.  My roommate can't stand the staff to the point that she won't go in past five.
3	Go there frequently for boba and to play cards once in awhile. Great hangout spot for young people to just chill and have a drink. The boba is made wonderfully. Not too chewy and not too hard. Tea drinks are also legit. Just the right amount of bitterness with a hint of fruit. Shaved ice is alright. Not the best since the ice isn't really that smooth.. kind of chunky and sometimes they overload on the syrup and what not.They do have some snacks which I guess are okay. The sweet toast is alright and so are the fried taro balls. Everything else is what you would find at other boba places like: french fries, fried chicken etc. They also have meals which are not the best in the world.  Wouldn't not come here for legit chinese food. Pros: great boba and teaAwesome hang out spot + wifiCons: No legit chinese food (as in meals) Servers can sometimes neglect you at busy times (night)Ok customer service
4	Prices are a little high when you get the non traditional stuff, but the milk tea, and its variants are good here. Service is pretty fast, but the no credit card under $10 policy stinks.
3	the fruit blends with boba and the almond milk tea are oh sooo yummy! the toast with sugar is sinfully good the only reason why they get 3 stars is because the service is so so.
4	I am a big fan of boba tea, and have tasted it wherever I have been able to find it in the world. I have been to two branches of the Tea Station in San Diego, and two others in Irvine (now there is only one there, I think), and the one here in Vegas, of course. All have consistently excellent boba, with the right consistency and flavor, which is not so easy to find. My favorite tea is the "boba milk green tea," which is a jasmine green milk tea, which is also consistently excellent. I have to say that this tea and boba are the best I've had anywhere, although I admit that I have not been to Taiwan or anywhere in Asia. I have had my share of bad boba and bad tea, and it is nice to know that it is excellent 99% of the time at any branch of the Tea Station.
3	While this place is worthy of four stars, I unfortunately agree with many others who say the service isn't as great as it should be (thus the reason why I give it a three; well, technically, I wish there was a 3.5 option!) With that aside, their menus are full of options to where you have a variety of teas, milks, bobas, and even plates of appetizers and meals to choose from. I've been coming here since high school, and this is a perfect environment for locals to come and sit down in a group, play some cards, and have a light snack/tea for the afternoon/evening. This place is usually mobbed at later hours of the day, but otherwise I always find this to be my place to go when catching up with old friends or discussing business matters.
3	My friend and I were on a mission for boba... at 2am, so this was the only place that was open. One that would satisfy our craving, I mean.I had the milk green tea with boba, and it was perfect.  The only thing not so perfect was the increasing prices! I came here about a month or two ago, and the large teas were 4.75, which is now the price of the regular teas! The large is 6 whopping buckaroos!! 6 bucks for a large milk tea?! AND I payed for it!! Can someone please tell me what went wrong in that situation?!! Wahhh!!!On a better note, if you order your boba to-go, I believe you get 15 percent off your purchase?*NOTE: if you like paying for expensive and tasty boba, please remember to ask for a stamp card. Haha, thank you.
3	For some strange reason, I've always had something against Tea Station. The thing is, it's been such a long time since I last went, I don't really remember what it is. But it's something that has stuck in my mind for years and I avoided the place like the plague. Was it bad service? Reading other people's reviews, that could be it.Anyway, I finally returned this evening to hang out with a friend. We didn't order anything demanding - just a couple of drinks. The waitress took our order quickly, the drinks came out in good time, and then they left us alone as we talked for a couple of hours. When it was time to leave, it was easy enough to flag the waitress down, get the check, and be on our way.Other people have mentioned that their service has vastly improved. I'll second that. It certainly was fast, accurate, and then invisible when we didn't need them. I'll still choose other boba places during the day when everything is open, but if you need a late night fix or just a chill late night hangout spot, Tea Station is a solid choice.
2	This is my usual stop area when I'm craving for milk tea.  Same menu as San Diego but customer service definitely needs improvement. I found a new place in LV called Tea Time Cafe by centennial & customer service and quality is superb! Should check it out sometime.
2	Tea Station is consistently good for me, but this one was a little pricey compared to the others. First of all, parking was easy. Being from LA-- this has to be mentioned.I get the curry chicken and rice = great but the drinks is where they shine. Boba milk tea and blueberry green tea are good but for $6+ each ... yeah, no thanks.There are cheaper, more delicious places. Sorry, Tea Station.
4	Seem like a great place to hang out and talk with a group of friend.I'm a tea lover and they have a great variety of tea available. Wish I can try them all. I usually order the green apple tea.
4	great milk tea! Fun place to hanging out anc chilling with your friends. I love there a lot! and i usually go there with my friends however i dunt think it's really clean :(
4	We had the green boba tea, and dawggone - this was definitely green tea - I've never had such intensity in the stuff - I suppose I could make it as strong too but I doubt it would taste as good.  Their menu is extensive; also expensive.  Hopefully the rest of their offerings will be as succulent as this one.
3	A nice place to hang out with friends over tea or maybe share a shaved ice dessert. I'd recommend the taro milk tea (hot or cold). Unfortunately, aside from the honey toast, I haven't had much luck with their food. With so many better places around, I would skip eating here.
4	Karen was super helpful. Green apple yogurt ice tea was my choice today. A little sour kick to it. Delicious. Almond ice tea. Pretty good. Normal. Haha.will Definitely go again next time i'm in Vegas!
3	I decided a change of pace was in order so I stopped here today instead of heading to the nearest Starbucks.I got a bubble black tea, unsweetened, and it was quite good.  There was a bit of a language barrier.  She was asking if I wanted sugar and at first I wasn't understanding at all.  Finally I understood, and I got my tea without sugar.  The place is close to Las Vegas Little Theatre where I spend a good amount of time, but I think I'll stay nearer to Schiff Drive where it is.  The location of the Tea Station makes heading west out of the lot a pain in the neck.
5	My fav boba joint.  They are almost always packed, especially late night, so consider waiting for a table, or taking it to go.Very flavorful teas and drinks, with some good food to boot.Try a yogurt snow ice or jelly ice...my favorites are probably strawberry or passion fruit.
3	This is my first run in with Taro tea and it's yummy! It's milky, purple and sweet. I enjoyed that with some crispy chicken appetizers. I thought it was pretty good and I love that it's open late. It's a great place to catch up with friends over drinks and snacks. If I knew this place was open so much later than other places in town I would have come here first instead of driving  all over town.
5	Wow. Late night hot spot. From a sip of tea to a full meal, this is the place to be. Sweet Potato Balls!
5	Love this place. It's crowded at night but I find this place lovely for an afternoon. I'm always ordering takoyaki, so I have yet to try anything else. I absolutely love their lychee snow, it's going to be hard ordering a different drink!
4	Just came in for a snow ice and a boba tea, we didn't realize they have food too! Nice atmosphere, good service. Next time I come I am getting the ice with black beans and sweetened condensed milk, that looks great!AWESOME place to read a book and "chill" out- no rush, just like a good ol coffee house!
3	June 28, 2011  It's been quite some time since I last visited Tea Station.  So long in fact that I got the name wrong while I was looking for it on Yelp to review.  Tea Planet is what I typed out for some reason.  Any who...Pros:  Pretty good selection of flavors.   Chill ambiance  Quick service  Outdoor seating  Friendly crowds  Open lateCons:  Parking sucks. (Chinatown..what do you expect)  If you hate the smell of smoke, don't sit outside... It's smoker's delight.  Did I mention Parking sucks?Verdict:  A pretty chill place.  It seems like they are always busy.  I went here after dining at Kaya Sushi for some milk tea with some out-of-towners.  I really liked the ambiance  Everyone there (staff and customers included) seemed to have a very down-to-earth attitude.  Sitting outside at night, I was able to enjoy the nice breeze coupled with the warm temperature... perfect during this time of year.  They are open late too, so if you are looking for some late night tea, don't rule out this place.Tips:  If you are struggling to find parking.  Just post in one spot.  People are always leaving.  Nevertheless, the parking situation is a hassle.  This place doesn't close til 2 am (at least the night I was there).  The crowd is pretty loud.  Lots of younger people.  It was a fun night.  We just hung out outside had a nonalcoholic bevie and just reminisced some good times in Cali during my teen years.
3	I've recently became a Tea Station fanatic, so I go to one whenever one is in the area. After entering the store, there's a sign on a bulletin board that reads, "Different locations. Same great taste." It assured me that I wouldn't be disappointed before I ordered but after I ordered, I was disappointed. I ordered the usual boba green milk tea but it lacked that strong taste that I loved. It even tasted a bit watered down even. I thought I got my milk tea fix for the day but guess not!
3	This place is ok. It's open late, they have food, and there are lots of places to sit, all which make for a great boba establishment. However, I was a bit disappointed with their actual boba! It was just a little too chewy for me... The texture just wasn't quite right. And the tea - I just ordered a plain black tea w milk and it also was a little off. There wasn't enough milk and it was too watered down. Sweetness level for normal sugar was ok but overall it tasted like when u leave ur drink out too long and all the ice melts. I'd still come here again though for the atmosphere, and maybe to try some of their other drinks or food. :)
4	My recommendation: Taro Boba SmoothieWith god awful customer service, higher than usual prices and some of the slowest preparation time I've ever seen in my life, the only thing saving this place is that their boba smoothies are the best in town. Many a times have I had a craving for Taro Boba that can only properly be satiated with a Tea Station smoothie. Just make sure you come with cash because they do not accept card for orders less than $10.
4	Loved this place. The honey lemon boba teas was excellent. Fun feel and we will be back.
4	I'm one of the people who comes to this place late at night, either right before or right after a delicious meal at Ichiza. You might think getting tea in the middle of the night is for the birds, but it is not: it's for the cools. I really like the tea they have here. I usually always get the mixed fruit tea, which is a mix of different fruits steeped to flavor your beverage. The tea is really good and comes out piping hot, so it kinda forces you to spend some time there. The place is cool, and they serve things other than tea. They have boba, shaved ice-type things, and other things I haven't gotten around to trying yet. Plus, the prices are right, though I dislike that I have to spend $20 or more to use plastic. The only reason this place doesn't deserve a five-star rating? Some of the girls who work here are kinda mean. Or just in a perpetual rush. Even on days when I've gone and it's kinda empty, they're always kinda mad at me. One time, my friend asked one of the girls what something tasted like (I believe she asked what taro tasted like) and the waitress says "I can't describe it. It's like describing what an apple tastes like. Can you tell me what an apple tastes like? Because I can't" It's funny in retrospect, but it wasn't so funny then. I'll continue to come here because I like the place so much, and I think it's a great casual date spot, but I just wish the waitresses would be nicer.
5	This place is the proper place for the person who likes to meet and talk with people at any time. It opens til really late and their teas are so fragrant and great! They are selling Hot tea, Ice tea, Fruit tea,  Herb tea etc. I will also pick this place as the best boba place.Whenever there's nothing special, and Whenever I don't want to eat a lot at night, but whenever I want to meet my friends or when I want to have your own time, I go there and have a really good time with tea and playing card game that they have. Different from my home country, South Korea, I couldn't find a lot of  tea cafe place that runs til late at night in America. But I finally found here and I enjoy going there. They're also serving good asian dishes. I love them too.This place is mostly crowded especially friday and saturday night. but you can get seats soon and they have some seats out side too.
4	Decisions, Decisions.I swear the menu is larger than the Cheesecake Factory's.  They must have every possible permutation of tea or boba drink at this joint.  Unfortunately, I never really venture past the tried and true here.  Perhaps it's because I have no idea what some of those things are (what exactly is grassy jelly?)  Too bad, because I could come here every day for months and never have the same drink twice.  My favorite is the plain old iced honey green tea.  It's never too sweet and it's always got that nice stiff green tea flavor with tannins to boot.  I could probably live off this stuff.I do love to come here and hang out.  On my most recent visit, a friend and I plopped ourselves in a booth, ordered a couple drinks and chatted.  No one even so much as bothered us and if we wanted something, we just waved someone down.  They did eventually ask us to pay, rather than just dropping a check off, which kind of surprised me until I realized it was past 3am.  We had been there for 5 hours and never felt any pressure to leave that whole time.One of these days I will have to order a desert.  Some of those concoctions look pretty tasty.  Oh, now which one?
3	Standard place to get boba.  Nothing extraordinary and I have nothing bad to say about this place either.  I ordered the Iced House Coffee with Boba and it was pretty good.  The boba's texture was soft and chewy as it should be.  I also tried the small shaved ice.  It was way too sweet, but good for a couple of bites.  I can't remember what I paid here, but my experiences at other Tea Station's make me want to say that they are a tad bid overpriced.  One thing I could say is that they could move the tables around because it's an awkward set up in there and it gets crowded when trying to order something.  If I go to Vegas again I will come here because it's the only place I know of to get Boba.
4	Tea Station addict confesses...relieved to find one in the desert. Yes it's home away from home.  Kudos to franchises!
3	Service takes forever. It is a pricy place just for boba.
2	It's good! but.. expensive and they use syrup and or powder for their fruit drinks.If a boba place is going to use syrup and or powder I would expect it to be cheaper not expensive.
3	Good drinks.  Service is kinda iffy.  but whatever.A bit on the pricey side, but it's Vegas.Drinks are a tad sweet.
4	This place has a pretty extensive menu. There are pages upon pages of various teas and smoothies... who would've thought? There is also a selection of snacks made to order. I had the passion fruit green tea with lychee jelly. Dang this is some strong green tea! I can actually taste/feel the tartness. I was caught off guard because I'm used to overly sweet drinks. The jelly could be better, though. I prefer the clear jelly that's used in philly and new york drinks instead of the white opaque one that was given. Overall, this is not a  bad spot to quench your thirst, especially in this hot weather.
3	Came here with a few friends visiting from LA.. One of my friends, has an obsession with this place..Butter Toast and a side scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream: If you like Butter and Vanilla Ice Cream, then you might just find yourself a new habit!.. A fat slice of Toast that tasted like a sugar crusted bar of butter! The slice of toast came warm and with the cold ice cream.. 'Ahhh'.... (Kinda reminded me of the Lava Cake from Chart House or at Morton's..) Just melted in my mouth.. I felt pretty guilty eating this but it was worth the sugar fix or butter fix?! Watermelon Juice with Boba: I had a tough time choosing a drink since they had so many combinations to choose from. I noticed a chalkboard hanging on the wall with their special items written on it. I saw watermelon, I love watermelon, especially during the blazing summer heat! I thought it was the most refreshing choice, I just added boba. Fresh, tasted like sticking a straw into an actual watermelon! and the boba itself had the right chew and sweetness. A nice choice to cool yourself down! Place was Clean and Simple, happy bright colors.. typical boba restaurant decor. Service and prices were fine. Decent spot to have a drink, cool off, and get high off butter!
4	I love the Passion fruit jelly ice drink that they make but they chrger $1 extra for aloe! I wanted to replace the boboa with aloe and didn't mind paying 50 cents extra. But $7 bucks for a med ice drink is expensive!
5	My bf's relative from Vegas brought us here. If you happen to go to Chinatown during your Las Vegas trip and like tapioca then it is definitely worth your time to try this place. I had their boba milk tea, and the milk tea was better than ALLL the boba places in San Francisco and comparable to Verde Tea in Mountain View, Ca. The drive was quite far from our hotel on The Strip, but if this was on The Strip, I would get it every time I visit Vegas. Oh yeah, it was very refreshing for the 107 degree weather!
2	i use to think that there is no other place other than tea station. despite their horrible service, i still continued to buy my tea there. One day, i just couldnt stand it anymore, they had new people working and twice they made my drink wrong. when i have to pay $6 for my boba, it better be my money's worth. i have been ordering the wintermelon milk tea for 2 years and they now tell me that the drink does not exist. they poured milk into the wintermelon green tea that they mistakenly made for me. Of course it did not taste they way it was suppose to. i complained and they did not want to replace my drink until i got a bit furious with them. they ended up just making me a milk tea, which was delicious but i did not enjoy it, just for the fact that i initially wanted my wintermelon milk tea and what they put me through, just for a simple drink.
5	I am sitting at Tea Station after getting something to drink and eat. My server was Karen, I had to ask her how to connect to the WiFi, it was very simple. Sh pretty much left me alone when she noticed I was was on my iPad. I ordered the Fried Squid Balls and the Tea Flavored Deluxe Taiwanese Angel Hair with Iced Green Tea. For desert I had the Mango Shaved Ice, (I was waffling between that and the Strawberry Shaved Ice).The Squid Balls were easy to eat, I expected them to be a lot more chewy than they were, an excellent choice.The Angle Hair soup had just enough spice to be flavorful with out burning your mouth, another excellent choice. The green tea was very good with a strong flavor of jasmine (I love jasmine tea). The large green tea is just right, not something you are going to guzzle down, you want to savor the flavor.The Mango Shaved Ice is huge, large enough to share, admittedly it is mostly shaved ice; however, on a hot day like today, shaved ice is just the right desert. There are bite sized chunks of mango and cream on is dish. Next time I will be going after the Strawberry Shaved Ice.I came here after reading the write up posted by Lilly L. She gave this place a 5 star rating, and I agree with her, this place is great for coming in and relaxing out of the heat. The only sad point I had was dropping one of my Squid balls on the floor, that's what I get for not paying attention to my eating and surfing the web.Looking over the extensive menu their main selection is Tea, if you are in the mood for a light meal, there are enough offerings to please your pallet. Their menu has icons to show you how each item is served,
3	Honey dew slush is my favorite boba drink so far, hate their milk tea, many great desserts and teas . Their crunchy pork w/rice is decent . Customer service is a little slow and not as helpful but it doesn't bother me anymore . Cute little hang out place for little kids .
2	Tea Station, aka Tea Planet (does anyone else call it that besides my friends and I? ) is very well known in Las Vegas ever since the early 2000's. If you've never been there or you're a tourist in Vegas, it's definitely the place to go if you want to meet locals, especially the Asians. It's where we Asians flock at night time, and where the business people meet during the day. You get people of all ethnicity coming here too to buy "boba" since it's located in the heart of Chinatown. Due to it's name and longstanding reputation in Cali.. many people who aren't familiar with the other cheaper "boba" places in Las Vegas will come to TP just to drop $6 + tax for a simple drink. Honestly, I DO NOT understand how it became so popular or why, but for the super expensive price you pay just to get boba made from powder and service that is dirt poor.. TP is definitely not worth it!Perhaps because it's located in a very busy complex (thanks to Ichiza upstairs, Kaya & Zizzy bar next door) the place is just always full of people..However, if you really look at it closely, not everyone orders drinks.. it's just a place to go hang out and crowd around...pretty much loiter, making it busy all the time. But in reality, Tea Planet is expensive, overpriced, and the service there is HORRIBLE. Majority of their drinks start off at $5+ tax for a medium, even though nothing is fresh but powdered.. their large drinks is $6+ tax.. Finger foods such as spicy chicken and what not is $5 + tax for a small plate, and a meal is $8.99 and up.. Some of their noodle bowls go up to $12.00 +tax.. Everything there is overpriced, and the portions are skimpy. Don't be fooled by their "tea flavored" prefixes on the menus.. There's no tea flavor in any of it. On top of that, they occasionally raise their prices up and their portions seems to get smaller and smaller over time. The other day, I met up with friends there and order my usual Royal Milk Tea in a pot. The "pot" is supposed to be their size medium at $5 + tax ( their "urn" is the large size) .. when I ordered it using the size names they wrote on their menu, my waitress had no idea what the eff I was talking about. She kept asking me what size I wanted and I kept repeating the pot. They only have pot and urn on the menus, how was I supposed to know the size. She should know because she works there but sure enough, she didn't. Everyone I talk to has something bad to say about the girls that serve there. Not only are they slow, but their attitude is so bitchy, especially when they mess up your drinks and you tell them to remake it. Overall, for the price you pay, service is just horrible. And since they bring out the drinks to you, it's customary to tip them too. Not worth it at all for bad service.
4	This place has really good taro milk tea. Its the only one I get when I go here. I havent tried anything else besides that. Dont expect superior customer service here. Its more like give them your order and voila. DONE! =) The parking sucks here. We always have to drive around before we find a spot.
1	Great Tea, Good Food, Horrible Service.
3	I came here with one of my best friends from out of town and her son. I thought I knew what I was ordering but I had no idea until I bit into it. When I saw it on the menu it looked like and I thought it was a crispy spring roll. I was so wrong ! The outside wasn't crispy at all it looked like shriveled skin. I tried really hard to try to eat them because my friend was treating and I didn't want to be rude. I pretended it was really good and I said "They are so good you should really try some". My friend took one and didn't have another after that. I tried to eat my third one but while my friend and her son were looking at all the teas I spit it out on a napkin. I couldn't take it anymore . I finally told my friend and she understood because she didn't like them either. I'm so glad we have the same taste! I also tried the Taro Balls which were really good. They are fried to a golden brown and not too sweet. My friend's son also had a Honey Dew Slurpee like drink that he let me try. I didn't want to give it back ! It tasted better then my Lychee drink that I was having !
1	Quite honestly one of the WORST places ever and it's definitely not authentic either.  Their flavorings all taste like artificial flavoring powders.  It tastes nothing like the locations in California or other cities. I've gone there half a dozen times and each time their services gets worse and the food get worse as well.  I took my family there for a family dessert night after eating elsewhere for dinner.  I ordered shaved ice with a side of the chewy (not fried) taro balls ON THE SIDE, fried sweet bread, and fried taro balls. The waitress smirks and says "Ummm, that's not going to taste good because the shaved ice is cold and the taro balls are hot ". OH YOU DON'T SAY, REALLY?! I know that because I was born in Taiwan, grew up eating this stuff so I think I know what I'm doing. Not to mention, I order this EVERY TIME I'm there...so she places my order and comes back later and tells me she doesn't have anymore taro balls but she can do rice balls. So I asked her again, so if you're out of taro balls then what are you serving with the red bean soup when people order that? She smirks AGAIN so I just told her to forget about it.  Each time a dish was dropped off at the table, it was literally thrown on the table and not a word mentioned on what the dish was. Long story short, I'm in service industry and I've never given someone a 10% tip. But I did last night. I'll never go back. Worst customer service, if any, and worst food/beverages!!!!
4	If you're going to make it worth coming here, I recommend ordering tea.  I would avoid paying for overpriced boba(bubble) tea or milk teas.  However, their specialty teas in the teapots are definitely worth a try.  We tried the grass jelly hot tea pot.  It is served hot, but it gels up like gelatin as it cools.  It has red beans, boba, and maybe some other ingredients that I don't remember.  I've never paid $7-$8 for bubble tea before!!!  Ridiculous.  I'd look for nearby competitors for bubble tea but for food and tea, I'd definitely recommend checking this place out.  The location is a bit inconveniently off the strip near the Chinatown area.  The place is small cozy and clean with bright lighting.
3	Nice to see a familiar place in vegas for boba! Nice clean and quiet restaurant/tea shop...waitresses were surprised when I spoke in mandarin...the chrysanthemum tea came out watered down and the crystal jello (aiyu) tasted different, but when you're in vegas and desperate for boba, that's perfectly acceptable to me. Refreshing after being dehydrated from post-alcoholic nights and partying :)
1	I really want to say: screw this place!!!Service is horrible.  They're rude, slow, and not friendly at all!!  I usually take my drink to go and even with such a quick transaction they're just so uninviting.I tried to sit down and have dessert once and it took a while to get acknowledged.  I had to flag a waitress down.  Forget asking for suggestions, it's like communicating with a child.  I ordered the mango shaved ice, but I can't tell you how it tasted, because after waiting for 20 minutes, it never arrived.  Apparently the excess of servers standing around kept ours to occupied to bother punching in my order.  I mentioned it to her, she looked surprised, I saw her tell the person behind the counter and he proceeded to make it. F that... I walked out.I come here because I'll have my occasional boba craving and I eat off spring mountain a lot.  After finding other joints who serve boba, along with the shit service, I don't come here anymore.  This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!Btw.  Make sure you always taste your drink before you leave the place.  I ordered a large milk tea taro to-go for my BF once and didn't taste it cause it was for him.  Well, I got home and gave it to him and it tasted like purple water.  I paid almost six dollars for that and was so pissed.  I really wanted to go back but it was just a waste of energy.Here are a few places I've found that serves boba- cheaper, yummier, nicer cashiers:1.) Boba City Cafe2.) Cefiore3.) Waffles Cafe4.) Easy Life Boba TeaAnd I believe there is a Q-cup opening up off of jones where China Mama is located.
4	I decided that when I am in need of tea and it is late at night, I have no issues driving the distance from my place (13miles) to sip on some warm delicious Mixed Fruit Tea, or maybe even a new tea that I would probably try the next time I am there. I absolutely love the fact that they are open so late on the week days! I went on a Wednesday and it was 11:00 and still hoppin. I liked the atmosphere and how everyone seemed pretty chill. They have a huge menu, I could not get through it all, but I will be back to try new things, guaranteed!  I cannot really say much beyond that, because it was my first time and I just had the Mixed Fruit Tea, which was amazing and made my insides feel all warm and relaxed. I felt so relaxed and enjoyed just hanging out that I really did not want to drive home. I just ate, I was having this delicious tea, enjoying the conversations, it took strength to get out of my chair. In the end all I can really says is, "I'll be back!" -said in the famous voice everyone knows and loves.
4	It is painfully obvious that Tea Planet, or Tea Station now..I guess, is notorious for its terrible service and overpriced drinks.  Yes, it is worth mentioning and Im sure there is a consensus in the feeling.  So why would I bother dwelling on it like everyone else?Whenever I find myself in Vegas I always crave the pork chops from this place.  I could care less about anything else on the menu honestly.  Last time I was there it was under the menu as "M10 Tea Flavored Pork Chops".  As far as my experiences have gone with this dish, it was never a small portion.  The crusted, deep fried chop is usual a decent sized cut.  The chop is always cooked through, but not dry and overdone.  Juicy with a good amount of pork fatty goodness.  It sits on a bed of an about even ratio-ed rice portion with a meat mash blanketed by an over easy egg.  Theres also three sides accompanied on the dish that never seem to be the same.  It seems more of the luck of the draw, what sides they feel like preparing that day.  Thats pretty much the only inconsistencies they have with the plate.  Which is fine because Im sure they see those three sides the same way I see them as....filler. The times Ive been here, Ive had enough company to not notice or care of the wait time for our orders to arrive.  Were usually busy talking about our trip and trying to enjoy ourselves anyhow.  And were usually a big enough group to attract the attention of our server.  Regardless, you should know what to expect when going to these types of places anyhow.  Either you deal or you dont go.
3	I really enjoy good tea and that's the main reason I continue to go to this place.  The tea is great, and the boba is great.  I don't like my tea and drinks to be too sugary as to mask the taste of the teas.  So they get a lot of props for that, but this place is a hit or miss every time.If I come here with my Asian friends the service is much faster, we get greeted on entrance and wait 5-6 minutes for our order.  If I come here with say...my Hispanic friends, a lot of times, they either forgot we entered the store altogether, or forgot we ordered a drink.  I don't want to point this observation out to my friends, but it is true and valid.
2	Service has always been horrible for the past couple years, even when it used to be tea planet. The good boba never makes up for it and their slow staff.
5	taro milk tea with boba my favorite!!!
4	always a fan of boba.  Service is never expected to be "nice".  You don't go and eat here for the service, that's for sure.  The drinks are another story and I ordered their noodle soup dish that had shredded pork with bok choy.  Unfortunately they don't give enough veggies or meat but plenty of noodles.  The noise level is a bit high and they could turn down the music a bit.  You barely can hear the other person talking across the table from you.Opened late when the other restaurants in the shopping plaza right next door close at 10pm is a benefit here.  I was happy to at least get my "noodle on" and stay warm.
5	I'm so relieved they have a Tea Station in Vegas, it just makes everything so much better! The Boba and Milk Tea here tastes just as good as any other one Tea Station in California so I give it a 5 star! Recommendations: LARGE Boba Milk Tea--plain and simple is the way to go! & large because you're going to want more!
2	I'm quite keen on service. Their service here was horrible. Maybe I could say bad timing for me, but regardless of time, it was still horrible service. Walking in, do find my own seat? I guess I do since there happened to be servers running to and fro and perhaps avoiding newly arrived customers. Whatever the case, I went ahead and pulled myself a chair. Waited quite a bit to finally get an order from a server, but I think at this time, I was already fed up with bad service. Fast forwarding from bad service, the drinks were all right. Tasted better. Still on the hunt on finding a nice place with decent service and serves delicious tea. If anyone else has, let me know.
1	me and my friends wanted to share two pots of hot milk tea. When we got them they were in two big bowls with spoons. We asked for cups and they said that each cup would cost an extra $1....seriously? We are paying for tea and we can't have cups to drink them?? This store obviously cares more about ripping me off than actually making me a happy customer...never coming here for boba again! (yes, the boba was good but there's plenty of other places in lv to get boba, and those places give you cups)
1	Beyond the fact that I like their green milk tea and rose milk tea, I have nothing good to say about this place.  Service, as everyone else on here seems to agree, is HORRIBLE!! I don't know why I even bother tipping (when eat in) anymore.  I usually tip a very small % because the service is THAT bad.  Now that I think about it, they charge over $6 for a large drink (!!!!) and add so much ice, I shouldn't have to tip.  If I ever go back and actually sit down to enjoy my drink, I will not be leaving a tip. And another thing that have intrigued me for a long time is that, every time we go get a beverage to go (I order the same thing every time), they charge me differently.  I don't get it.  How can the same drink be priced differently each time?  My boyfriend thinks it's because he's non-Asian and they think they can rip him off because he's white.  I don't know how true that is but it is quite strange, don't you think?
3	The Tea Station in California is so much better! The drinks tasted the same, but they were way stingier on the amount of boba at the LV location.
5	I have died and gone to boba heaven!!!  I LOVE BOBA!!!  This place is my new fave!!Lychee snow ice with boba = Yes, yes, yes!!!  Sooo perfectly smooth and delicious and a generous serving of absolutely yummy boba!!My friend got the passion fruit jelly ice and was kind enough to let me sip on that.  What on earth is this amazing deliciousness?!?!  I just about flipped out it was so yummy!!I'm willing to drive back to Vegas just to come back here ... But I just discovered they have locations in CA!!  I'll be yelping about those shortly  ;)
2	Good typical boba, slower than the second coming of christ service. This place is getting on my last nerve.
3	I still need to get my boba fix even when I am vacationing in Vegas...I usually always go here when I'm in Vegas. Pretty much the same as any other Tea Station that I have been to. Their boba is good. Its soft and chewy. Prices here in my opinion are a bit high for boba. Service, like all the other Tea Stations that I have been to, is not very friendly, but this is one of the better boba places in vegas to go to. My usual drinks are:-Milk tea-Jasmin/Green Milk tea-Thai Tea-Coffee Milk tea
2	Minus 2 stars for the horrible horrible service today, maybe the worst I ever experienced...What in hell did we do to deserve this?!!My +1 and I decided to have a seat and enjoy our boba after a long day of work but the hostess completely ignored our existence for 15 minuts, she was just standing there avoiding eye contact.When she finally acknolege us and take our order it took 15 more minut for our two green tea to come out.Then 20 minuts to get our check after asking for it and it came out wrong...can you say "annoying?!!"Plus the place was sooo load, it gave me a headache when I just wanted to relax...Also we politely asked her for the wifi password but she just said "I don't know" and walked away from us with a very pissed face on.Excuse us for disturbing your gracious time my queen...I really wanted to stay your fan tea station but save yourself from the mean waitress...take your boba to go.
5	I forgot how much I missed this place! It's a great place to just really sit down, and enjoy a good drink or snack with friends. You come in, and you expect it to be a very fun place to go. I'm just glad that it stays away from creating an internet cafe concept, with less computers, and more social engagement. The way the place is decorated, and the furniture settings really invite that social atmosphere. Expect to see many customers playing cards, chess, checkers, or laughing and talking over boba or tea.Another great thing is that they offer free wifi. A perfect place to for a study group or even to do homework or papers on your own. If you want a place to study that provides choices either than coffees or lattes. I'd say this would be that place.My personal favorite is their Taro Boba. I've gone to many boba places and their Taro Boba just never tastes the way Tea Station's does. It just never compares. Tea Station's Taro Boba is just so smooth and rich with that Taro flavor. I would usually grab a small snack to go with my drink, and expect it to either be the squid balls or the sweet buttered toast. Sweet buttered toast is fluffy, sweet, and light. Expect it to be filling, but the simple concoction of this treat is such an ingenious concept! Toast with sugar and butter? It's amazing.If you want a more meaty and salty snack. Definitely the squid balls if you're adventurous and down for the seafood snacks! Its tasy with that seafood flavor, but eat expecting that it might be imitation seafood or artificial seafood because the texture sort of feels that way.I think the service was subpar. They do their job, and that's about it, but I'm glad that they do do their best to make an impression whether it would be a happy tone in their greeting or a smile.
3	3.5-4 stars if the service isn't so horrible and the food isn't overpriced. 5 stars for their tea selection and staff knowledge of teas. I fell absolutely in love with the honey ginseng tea. If you're sick, have a sore throat or flu... I highly recommend this tea! It goes down smoothly and clears up your sinuses. They offer a large selection of iced and hot teas (pot or cup) and bobas, the quality is good and flavors are delicious. There is something for everybody. Now on to the food... good selection (they've expanded their food menu), but prices are pretty steep for Asian food at a tea spot. The dishes and appetizers can stand to be $1-2 lower. Although the portions are generous and the presentation is lovely, in the end it is off-the-strip Asian food and the prices can be shocking to most locals. Needless to say, the food can range from good to great. After all, it's one of the only places in Vegas that offers green tea noodles (yum!) and their rice dishes come with complimentary side dishes (Korean-style). We definitely enjoyed our meals... hearty and plentiful. Aaaaand the service... AHH! The horrible service! The workers are nice, but not experienced. No sense of multi-tasking, forgot a few things we ordered... I had to get up and chase someone down for a refill on our waters. Whenever we needed ANYTHING, it took way too long for anyone to approach and deliver. Hopefully, they re-train their servers so that the overall experience for customers can improve.
1	Sat down and waited 20 minutes for them to notice me and give me a menu.  25 minutes later they didnt come back to take my order.  Some people came in and got their take out order immediately.  Been to this place several times before and this is by far the worst service i have received.  Will no longer come back.
4	I did not know there was a Chinatown 5 minutes from the Vegas Strip. I got the milk green tea with little boba and it was very good. I am giving it 4 not 5 stars because the price is pretty high compared to the one back in la. A regular boba on the menu can be as expensive as $5 including tax. Parking is easy.
5	You can't possible imagine how overjoyed I was to find a legit chinese tea cafe in Las Vegas's Chinatown Plaza! For those who are unfamiliar with Tea Station...it is famous chain of taiwanese drinks and snacks. My friends and I already had lunch at the plaza's Anime Ramen so we were too full to try any of their food; however, we still left room for some aromatic milk teas.I ordered a hot wintermelon tea (without pearls)! 1) because I was curious as to how a vegetable tea would taste like and 2) my friend highly recommended it. It was absolutely DELICIOUS and I must say,  I am hooked! I've always noticed that it is only available in authentic specialty chinese tea cafes, so it is relatively hard to find in franchises like quickly's, q-cup and tapioca express. I'm sure their other drinks (hot and cold) are just as good. For those of you who have never experienced it before, I think it is worth trying, because its flavor is very unique and deep. Overall, great cafe and I will definitely be returning for more when I'm in town!
3	Been coming here more often this past couple of months and sorry to have to bump it down a star. The food and drink is still delicious but friendlier service wouldn't hurt either. The wait staff never seem to carry a smile and when you sit there too long they kinda give you the eye. But hey only they have that scrumptious sweet butter toast that I can't get anywhere else.
3	I really think 3-stars is a bit generous.My review of this place is long overdue after countless times of going here.  Honestly, I think the only reason I'm not giving them 2-stars is because the cafe serves its purpose; you get in, sit, get your tea (or if you're craving for street food, by all means, have at it), and then you get out.It's very convenient to get your drink to go, and they give somewhat prompt service.  But their service when it comes to sit-in is horrendous.Along with the trash-talking in Mandarin about customers, they're pretty deficient on the hospitality department.Short story- one time I went there and our bill came to around $15.  We gave her $25 since we had big bills.  It does NOT make sense to keep the change.  $10 tip?  Are you kidding me?  We had to ask her for the change and when she gave it to us, it was short a couple dollars and cents.  We left no tip.(Just so you know me a bit better, I tend not to tip ONLY if the service is ridiculous.  I've never NOT given any tip because of bad food, that's something we risk as customers.  But in a city where the tip percentage is among the highest in the nation, I believe that the tip should be a reflection of the establishment's hospitality.  Thus, she received no tip.)
4	I like to visit Tea Station late at night.  Fair warning - the parking situation is CRAZY!  The lot is oddly-shaped and small... and people drive like they are cracked out of their skulls.  Anywho, they have some of the best drinks I have ever had... good taro milk drinks, honeydew snow ices, and really awesome milk teas.  The service can be spotty - the staff rarely come around to tables, so you have to flag them down - but once you do, they are nice.  The drinks really are incredible beyond belief :)  Also, their shredded pork soup with tea noodles is very good too.We used to have a favorite waitress, Pinky, who served us our late-night goodies... but they moved her to the day shift!  We are so distraught - we miss Pinky!  We rarely get to go to Tea Station during her shift... boo!  So if you see her, tell her that "the goofy couple who always orders two milk teas with no boba" says hi!
1	Love the matcha green tea with boba and the sweet buttered toast is good too.  But It's a little over priced, and they could use some new staff cause the women waitresses were just rude and unhelpful.
1	Hmm, two words .. HORRIBLE SERVICE ! why go to a place where youre gonna get treated like shit. on the other hand , boba is good. BUT ... ive had much better ones.
3	I give 3 stars ONLY because I love their coconut milk tea with boba. It IS pricey, but obviously worth it for me to keep going back there quite often. At Tea Station, the flavor & amount of sugar overpowers the tea taste (which probably isn't good for you health-wise haha) which is why I find their boba sooooo addicting. If you're looking for boba that HAS more of a tea taste, I suggest Volcano Tea instead.One thing I dislike is the service. I always order my drink to-go and the waitresses never smile, never greet you, and always have a blank face on... When I pay with cash most of the time they automatically assume the rest is their tip, which you should NEVER do. Because they assume that I owe them something after paying almost $7 dollars for a 16-18 oz. drink ON TOP OF the girls turning around and speaking a different language to their co-workers most likely trash-talking, I probably shouldn't leave a tip. But I do anyways.Overall, I've heard great things about the food, I LOVE the boba, and the whole atmosphere of the place is nice... Parking sucks though.
3	The formally known Tea Planet, I've been going to this place for years, gosh I feel old. Does anyone still call this place Tea planet? LOL I think its a way better name than Tea Station. If you didn't know this is a chain Boba, they also have locations in California. Boba: 4/5 I love their variety of boba's and styles they make it in. I love getting the passion fruit jelly ice because it just looks WILD. My boyfriend prefers the honey dew slush. I also like their hot boba's during the winter I love getting hot boba milk tea. It replaces my usual hot cocoa fix. I wish they did more natural fruit drinks rather than powdered boba's Food: 4/5 I've tried their sweet butter toast, Taiwanese sausages, Fried spicy chicken, & their tea flavored beef stew noodle. So  I've tried a couple things, they promote tea flavored foods but idk I don't really taste much tea but okay. The sweet butter toast is very sweet trust me! With a sweet tooth I couldn't even finish it. Taiwanese sausages are sweet pretty good, the fried spicy chicken wasn't as great as most places I've tried so that was disappointing because I love fried spicy chicken with my boba. The tea flavored beef stew noodle, isn't really special.  Happy hour: 2/5 Pretty good happy hour from 3-5pm $2.50-$3.50 drinks. Keep in mine none of the specialty drinks more like boba milk tea or boba milk green tea. So not much variety in their happy hour. Price: 3/5 decent price range from $3-$7 a drink depending on size and the way you like your boba, from cold. hot, slush, smoothie etc.Parking: 3/5 Depending on the time you go, parking for this place can be hell. From dinner hours to late the parking lot can be full and you'll be forced to park at the china town plaza and walk a bit of distance.
2	From the awful parking situation to the attitude encountered from a mistake made on their end - it's Meh. I've experienced better. The Tea Station is located on Spring Mountain. If you live(d) in Las Vegas or spent any time there recently, not much more need be said other than "parking sucks!". All I know is that if I had to wait a minute longer than I did for a space, this review wouldn't exist as I would have went elsewhere.As for the attitude - I place my order and as he's taking it down, for one of the drinks, I state "no Boba" which he confirms and even crosses out on his order pad. Lo and behold, the order is brought out with Boba and attitude ensues like I made a mistake. Luckily, I don't speak the language he spoke with the person who made the order because I'm sure it wasn't polite with regards to me - but as long as they didn't spit (or worse) in my drink, I'm good. The counter height is such that you can watch them make your drink so rest assured, I wasn't drinking anything I didn't order. Anyway, like most places, even in California, the price for these drinks is pretty high. Demand is high so the price is too.The price. The parking. The attitude. I'll pass on this place the next time I'm in Las Vegas and want a cool drink.
2	My friends and I love the hot Taro milk tea with boba here. But on our recent visit, we were so pissed by the service and the "new policies" they have. We got the large hot Taro milk tea with boba, and we had to buy another large size tea cause we needed to at least spend $12 dollars for our table (they have a policy that each person sitting should at least spend $4. Since there were three of us, we had to spend $12). When we got our orders, we asked for cups and they asked a dollar per cup!! Seriously what is that, I've never had to pay just to borrow extra utensils or cups in any restaurant. They tried to explain it as best as they could, but we couldn't understand what they were saying (language barrier) so we just let it go. But we were sitting there so annoyed with our two large bowls and not knowing what to do with it. We were so frustrated. The people weren't bad but their new "policies" suck.
2	I gave this place two stars because 1) the new policies suck. Our server would not give me and my friends  extra cups for a large bowl of tea boba. There was an extra charge of $1 for an extra cup. I even asked if there was an extra charge for a spoon. Since they charge on everything 2)over priced drinks- the tea bobas here are almost about $6! I would rather go to volcano tea house down the street for half the price with the same or even better tasting boba   3) the food isn't great- I ordered some noodle soup and it tasted very top ramen like.. I could have just made it at home for free. 4) staff can't speak English! 5) service isn't too good either. So in general the only great thing about this place is that it's open late usually open till 1-2am.
2	I have been here countless times and was always with good company, probably why we don't mind their bad service (I'm Asian, it's Chinatown..) but this time their service just really got to my nerves. They like to act dumb, don't even understand well, seems like they don't even know their most basic items and they talk in their language in front of customers. Almost like you owe it to them that you are in their establishment (REALLY... Such a privilege.) We first ordered a large tea to share but they said we HAVE to order $4/person which i don't get, i feel almost like im at a club and I had to pay for a fee. We were in a relatively good mood so fine we just gave in and ordered another large one so we can get our tea with little cups to share. So we sat down and got our order (ummm they gave it to us in a TO GO cup, FAIL.) and notice it didn't come with cups so we asked for it and they said it was $1 each. WTH?!? Why did we even order a second one in the first place? As if paying overpriced milk tea wasn't enough, they just had to get their point across that they wanted to rip you off. (OK OK Tea Station, we get it!) The lady probably sensed we were getting annoyed so she gave us a small bowl for our drink. They can give us a small rice bowl container and not a cup? Does not make sense at all that it cracks me up! Only reason to go here is when it's past 11 and it's the only boba place that is open but thats about it. The lady said they charge extra per cup if you did not order food (then c'mon why name it TEA STATION? Shouldve named it Rice Station or something) I dont know? It's not like it's crazy packed and there are customers that are waiting to be seated? Somebody please shed some light. Okay now you can all say, "YOU MAD BRO?" I swear.... I'm not. LOL
4	i like their lavender milk tea as well as their earl grey milk tea. i like how they're piping hot.
4	This place is awesome. It's a nice chill spot after getting off work late and hanging out with friends. I love most of their warm milk teas, especially the almond milk tea. Actually, I pretty much like all of their milks teas, cold and warm. The staff pretty much leaves you alone except when you first get there (which is understandable). Their tactics for getting you to order instantly is a little intimidating I will admit. They just stand behind you until you're ready to order -_- I like how they place all of the teas on the shelves for everyone to see. It adds color and ambience to the place. I am already a regular and will continue to be one.Side note: I was iffy about coming here the first time because one of my close friends told me that she came here and hated it. She ordered regular boba drinks (not totally sure which ones) and almost all of her friends puked. My experience was nothing like this.
1	Every time I come here I expect to get better service than the time before.. and I'm always wrong. The servers seem as if they're too busy to care. There's always a crowd at night and people like to spend more than just a couple minutes here.  Parking can be difficult in this complex too. I don't think the boba is exceptional to make up for the poor service either. I guess if you with good company and you're craving boba late at night, this is just where everyone goes..
3	Walked in at about 10:45am sat. Boba was not ready sat and wait for bout 15min then Ordered a large milk tea boba did not taste like how it should... It was watered down, texture is thin, tasted like sugar water... I wouldn't order that drink again.
2	EH!Sort of expensive for what you get.  I understand that you might pay a little more to hang out and chill there.. but still... at 6 bucks for a medium with boba.... overpriced!The service is awkward (at least late night).  They kind of hover over you until you decide what to order.  Then, you never see them again.  I even had to go to the counter to get my order even though we were seated (confused - they took our order at the table, but I had to get up for my drink?)Anyway, I normally get the smoothie type of drink with boba.  Taro's my fav.  Blech!  I could taste the powder... and it was way too icy chunky tasting.  We also go the Red Bean (expecting it to taste like Red Bean ice cream).  Tasted like straight up beans.Anyway, I see the appeal of the place as a hang out joint... but I'll be sticking to Volcano Tea House just a minute away.
4	The service is usually lacking and the employees may not speak much English but the tea makes up for it. My two faves are the lychee green tea and the mango green tea-- with boba added of course.note, most of their cold tea is pretty sweet so I always ask for half sweetened.
2	I just got a quick drink for my class. I had original boba milk tea. It was okay the boba was a little bit too soft tho but the service was so BAD. Made me really up set.
1	The drinks are definitely below the standard set by the location in San Gabriel. The milk green tea I had wasn't flavorful enough and the sugar didn't help make it any more appealing.The service was even poorer than I expected for an Asian establishment. At this point, I'd rather go to the Volcano Tea a few blocks down in hopes of finding something better, and I never thought I would ever resort to that.
1	WILL NEVER COME BACK! HORRIBLE SERVICE & NASTY BOBA DRINK! I used to live in California and had always gone to Tea Station. The tea station in Vegas is just horrible! My boyfriend and I went to Tea Station last week, we had a peppermint milk tea w/ coffee jelly and a wheat germ milk tea w/ boba. The bill is $14.05. Seriously? 2 drinks for $14??And the drink is not even good. The waitress has some attitude problems and she messed up our order. Our waitress is so rude and the drink is so watery! She literally just threw our drinks on the table and she was so impatient while taking our orders. I mean, I've been to many Asian restaurant....I know how most restaurants services are and I can tolerate it because of the food. but tea station? Heck no! BAD FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE! There are many boba place is Vegas like Easy Life, No 1, Beegee.... I don't know why on earth I ended up here! There is no way that I"m gonna go back to that place for crappy drinks and horrible services! I don't know why they are still in business....
3	If it wasn't for the fact that they made bomb drinks and are open late in this 24/7 town,.. i probably wouldn't come here as often. The service is the worst part... they just don't know customer service.. often times I wanted to just never come back.. but they make legit food/drinks.. so if you've got the midnight craves, Yes this is a good spot.
2	My daughter was asking for Boba, so this was the closest I could find to where we were.  I was actually looking for Volcano which was recommended to me.  Insane prices for tea, $5-7?  It's tea.  I asked what she recommended and she said the rose milk tea.  I trusted her and bought it.  Wow!  Tasted like it had my grandmothers rose perfume in it.  Nasty.  I've had tea/boba at several places in CA and this was just way below average.
5	Nice.   I was so dissatisfied with volcano tea next door that I went hunting for a replacement.  Thank god tea station is here and close by.  Now I have to share my experience with you all.  Just beware... Volcano tea flavor has gone downhill.  Get ur fix at tea station instead.
3	Huge menu full of things you probably never heard about.There are tons of tea drinks here and an assortment of foods cooked in or with tea.  Every time I come here, I try to order something new.  Honestly, sometimes when I look at the items on the menu, I ask myself, "Are they just making this stuff up?"  I always end up having something that is good, but not amazing.  While this place gets crowded, and the service is far from good, the drinks aren't expensive and they have lots to choose from.  On my last visit I had a cold Wintermelon milk tea.  I can't really describe what a wintermelon looks like, since I've never seen one, but the taste was pretty mild and satisfying.  This is a fun place to experience food and beverages that you have most likely never had before.  Before you come, expect less than stellar service, and you'll have no problem getting the most out of this station of tea.
2	This is my first time ever @ a Tea Station (despite how there are many from where I live in California). I was excited to see what they have to offer. They did not open until 11 am so we showed up a few minutes beforehand. They were kind of rude! They should show up at least half an hour earlier to set up and open up shop so they can be ready to go exactly at 11. They gave us an attitude & we didnt even rush them! They were busy taking down chairs from all of the tables-at 11am (WTF?). It was super hot in there too!Their menu had sooooo many drinks but I settled for the jasmine milk tea. It was very strong, fragrant, & flavorful. Apparently it has a lot of caffeine in it because it made me all jittery & had to frequent the restroom many times. I got the beef bowl (like Yoshinoya or a Japanese sukiyaki beef) & my husband got the noodle with eggs and other stuff (personally, it looked like prisoner's food-all kinds of scrap scrambled with noodles & cabbage). My food was just ok. Apparently my husband likes his dish (he's a simple guy & settles for anything lol).Overall, I would not come back...
4	I love me some Tea Station! I was very surprised when I found one in Vegas!Came in here on a Monday morning (or 12 AM Sunday ;p) and this place was still packed even though they close at 1 AM. The staff were friendly and prompt with the order.I ordered the barley milk tea boba and an order of butter brick toast...the best buttery toast ever! The barley milk tea is one of my favorite boba drinks and the Tea Station always makes it darn bobalicious!
4	Yummy and delicious boba tea along with other varieties of asian teas.  Free wifi, cards, and games to play while you enjoy your drink.  They also make those ice bowls, but I haven't tried it yet although they look very good. Only downside is that the credit card requires a minimum purchase of $10.
4	This place still holds a special place in my heart for the thai tea with boba (it's my new "regular order").  However, some of the drinks have become too sweet for my liking.  Some time ago, a new person took over making the drinks on the night shift.  Ever since, I've had to specifically ask that they put less sugar in my order.  It's really overwhelming otherwise.When I began reviewing tea places, I got my drinks sans boba.  Now that I've become addicted to the boba itself, I will concede that Tea Station has incredible boba.  They have a good flavor and consistency and seem to offset how sweet the drinks have become, at least to some degree.  I'm still a regular visitor.
3	I came here for the first time a few days ago with Donald. I ordered hot taro milk tea, size large, and he ordered iced lavender milk tea. I thought my tea would be served in a little tea pot w/ cups like this: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dA7y-Lz1P5rOaPtCbwRUuA/l.jpg so I could share with Don, but instead it was served in a very large bowl with a soup spoon like the one Nelson posted a pic of: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qFsgiYsEXxr7qpR8zh9jpQ/l.jpg. It was a very huge bowl that wasn't meant for sharing. I ended up asking for a cup so I could pour some of the tea into it rather than sip from the spoon because it was way too hot.I really wasn't fond of the hot taro milk tea at all. It was ridiculously sweet. I felt like I gained 10 pounds just drinking it and it left a horrible after taste. I wouldn't get it again. I did like Donald's iced lavender tea though. It was refreshing and had a wonderful floral taste. If I ever come back, I'll probably stick to tea without milk because they seem to overdo it on the powder and sugar.
1	Don't go here. There are way better Mom&Pop boba places in Vegas that'll offer better food and golden service. A slice of bread would offer me better service than this place.I took my friend here on a late Tuesday night to get a late dessert. It was 11 PM and we and four other people were the only customers. We waited at our table for--not exaggerating--20 minutes before someone took our orders. We gave them our orders--two cold, easy boba drinks that shouldn't have taken very long to make--and we waited--again, not exaggerating--40 more minutes to get them. They would've taken longer if I didn't ask them where our orders were. The whole time we were waiting, we could hear waitresses laughing and talking behind the counter, not doing anything. And when we interrupted them to get our food, they deliberately acted annoyed. Wow. That wasn't my first bad experience there either; it was just the one that made me stop going altogether. On another occasion, they gave me the wrong order but wouldn't refund me or make my drink because I took ONE sip of it, wherein I found out it was the wrong drink. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. There are other bad experiences, but I'll end there.This place is a JOKE. These people will piss you off and ruin your day, and you don't deserve that because you're a rad person. So don't come here, Rad Person.
5	Great place for the best Tea/Boba/Smoothies/Desserts !!!!!
4	I would absolutely come back here for their Brown Sugar Boba Milk Tea alone. It had just the right blend of sweetness to it, enough that it didn't overwhelm the tea base. My other 2 friends had a hot rose tea and green tea boba respectively and boy did they look just as yummy. Other independently owned cafes (sambalatte, holly's cuppa etc) were starting to wrap it up by 8:30pm and we were left with the more commercial chains until I realized my galpal was driving right back to the West side of town so I decided to just bring up Tea Station. Considering it was my first time to actually sit down and enjoy the environment, I was pretty fixated at the little frames hung on the walls with miniature tea holders, not to mention -- they had me at 'Free Wifi'! My only criticism was the service. I wish our waitresses had more knowledge about what was on their menu since there aren't any descriptions underneath item names. Also, it's important to take note that the place doesn't't start filling up till about 11pm - and this was on a Thursday night - so if you're into a more mellow vibe, I'd suggest you come early.
1	Worst service.... & overpriced boba.
4	whenever we are in vegas and need a boba fix we check this place out.  it is kinda pricey for tea, but we love it!
5	I always get boba here when I visit LV.  The service is fast and friendly.  The shop is clean with a ver hip feeling.  But the main reason I come here is the boba is always fresh and the perfect consistency of chewiness!
4	So i enjoy the food and drinks here but when seated and trying to eat the service is a bit slow. The time of day i was there was not busy at all but the employees seems pre occupied with each other. Its quicker to walk to the counter and order what you want then it is to sit and wait for them to take your order it seems. Other than that the food and drinks are awesome. I tried the yogurt green tea with boba and it was interesting and good! Not something ive ever found back home in hawaii. I think this place would do well in hawaii. The tea chicken katsu was another interesting thing but def good and somethingi havnt heard of. Def a spot ill keep coming to but most likely not to sit and eat just because the attempts ive had at seating and eating there.
1	Tea Station isn't a bad chain but I had such a terrible experience at this Tea Station that I had to dole out my first Yelp review below three stars. Onward we go :(. After being harangued by a talkative gentlemen in a complete sweatsuit in the 100 degree weather, and giving said gentlemen a dollar for his troubles, me and my companion entered the Tea Station from refuge from the heat and the gentlemen.Our order was taken in a standard fashion with no line at the register, I ordered a milk tea with boba minus ice (the most standard or drinks) and a passionfruit green tea half sugar. 20 MINUTES LATER, the entire place was packed (with annoyed Asians) due to the lack of drink production, and we finally received the passion fruit green tea. Why we stayed that long in the first place is a mystery, possibly attributed to my catching up on Scramble with Friends games. While asking for a status update on the drinks the employees merely noted they were coming, even though they were not.We waited another ten minutes and my milk tea was finally produced. We left in an angered hurry at this point and once out the door I noticed that my large milk tea had but ten boba balls or so. Incredible! This place is remarkable for its failure to serve in a respectable fashion. Outrageous blaggetry! Blaggetry isn't even a word but it describes my experience here quite well.It doesn't need to be said, but I will not be frequenting this establishment again.Should have went to Volcano!
2	Man the service here is terrible! They act like they're doing you a favor by blessing you with their presence. AND their drinks are ridiculously overpriced. Makes me depressed that my best friend has to settle for their mediocre boba just because there's hardly any other places in Vegas.
1	It was 100+ degrees & we came here bc we wanted something cold & refreshing to cool us down.  We walk in and it feels a bit cooler (bc it wasn't 100+ degrees inside), but as we stay inside, it just gets HOT. Y'all should get a better AC or something for this place.  We ordered and waited for our drinks.  The girl brings back TWO tapioca milk teas when we ordered just one.  We tell her, she takes it back, brings another one & says that it's the tapioca milk green tea.  Okay.  We wait and wait.  4 out of 5 drinks come out (we saw her writing down each of the 5 orders).  Okay.  Soon, we decided it's time to leave so we ask the girl for our check & tell her to void the drink that we didn't receive.  She gave us this dirty look, looked at the counter, rolled her eyes, walked away to the cash register, talked to her coworker in her language, and then brought us the check.  We stayed inside bc we were waiting for our taxi to come & the girl at the register kept giving us this dirty look & was waiting for us to leave.  Finally the taxi came and we left. This place gets 1 star bc their tapioca milk tea & boba was bomb.  I won't be coming back unless I have no choice.
3	There are a LOT of tea options on their menu. The boba was good, not too mushy, and the tea wasn't overly sweet. I would like to come back the next time we are in the area to try some more of their options. My husband really liked his milk tea. They are also open really late..., staff was fairly friendly...  they didn't want to make my coconut boba tea withouth milk,( as many other places have done for me). They eventually caved, (tho they acted like it was a huge favor) and it was actually pretty good...(would have been better without the attitude). I'm giving three stars, at least until I can find a better boba place in the area.
4	I love coming here for their drinks.  Every time I'm in Vegas I stop by here 2-3x out of one week just to grab my favorite drink which is the Rose Green Milk Tea with Tapioca!
3	Tea Plan.. whoops "Tea Station" has been well established in Vegas for at least a bajillion years which makes it the OG for Asian beverages, or more appropriately the Triad of Asian beverages. Pro:-It is open late as... I don't even know maybe 3am? -Offers extensive choices of beverages and limited entrees-Board games and cards are present-Orders usually come out pretty quickCon: -$$$ (i.e. $5.75 for a large iced (insert flavor) tea that is 1/2 ice... ice cold man)-Service is really inconsistent, sometimes its okay, and sometimes you'll probably hate them- Parking here sucks. I recommend parking at the Chinatown plaza next door and walking over. - Skip the food, you'll thank me.- Doesn't really promote social loitering. Must spend x amount per x length of staySide notes:- Don't come here with intentions of studying, it won't happen.- Possibility changed their policy on outside food? I ate my street tacos here last time.
1	SLOWEST SERVICE EVER..... 3 years later and i finally get to order.Employee doesn't speak english that well....EXPENSIVE $7 Large Milk tea... Luckily SJ only cost about $4 for a large to please my ADDICTION!
1	This place was HORRIBLE!! I will NEVER give my business to this place again. They give the name a SHAME!! The service was awful and the people that works there are RUDE!! Never been to any tea station that has this bad of a service. Seriously if I could report ot the people that owe this corp. I would totally report them.The ones in LA are so much better.....if the workers in LV don't like working in servicing people in LV....then don't work....
1	My experience at this bubble tea place was bad!Bubble tea: I got Lychee and the sweetness was absolutely overpowering. It was so bad, I wished they had just dumped some water in there to thin it out. I also tried strawberry and that was also too sweet. Bleh!Boba: At first, I was delighted. The texture was great, not overly chewy or too soft. The subtle flavor was also present. BUT as the minutes passed, the boba started to freeze and instead of that black translucent color, I got light brown boba! I couldn't even bite through those freakin frozen balls. Argh! $$$$: Are they freakin out of their minds?? This stuff was not worth a quarter of the price! They are not realistic at all. It's not even on the strip, but they charge more for a drink than an entire meal I could get in the same complex.Service: This was the last straw! I'm usually very patient, since I also work in customer service, but the waitress just blew me off when I asked for the bill. Doubly Bleh and Argh!I will never stop by this place again. Okay, I'm sure they have other drinks that may be tasty, but I put a huge emphasis on customer service. Tea Station, you have lost me as a customer forever!!
3	Ordered a Lg Lychee green milk tea for ~7.- Fruity. Nothing special. average.- Expensive, then again all tea station are.- Fast to-go service. - bad parking- 75cents for water. lame. - side comment on egg pudding: flavorless. too clumpy.- boba better than any i've tried in vegas so far. sad.
2	pretty chitty customer service. We walked in, asked a question, and the waitress pretty much blew us off. it wasnt til 5 minutes later that she came over to see what we wanted to order.milk tea wasnt even good, and most definitely soured by the terrible customer service. the tapioca balls were too sweet and way too hard and chewy. The milk tea was also overpriced.I will not be returning.
3	came to tea station for the first time last week. never been to a tea station before.Ordered a mango frozen drink and butter toast.This place is really popular at night and a lot of people come here to hang out with friends.not sure if it's worth coming back to try more things but I'm open to that idea.Lots of drinks and food to choose from. Not sure on quality.indoor/outdoor seating. casual.bring an open mind.
3	the mango black tea is yummy. also the honeydew something or other. yum.but the service sucks, and they aren't open late night.
4	Being from San Diego I have always had a love for Tea Station, especially since it is a branch of Ten Ren, which is actually my favorite boba from San Francisco. (Ironically Ten Ren is one of the worst tea brands once you go back to Taiwan, but we're in the states here so come on now). I was hungover as shit and we needed to kill time so that traffic would die down so we decided to drop by. I got me an almond milk tea without boba and the only thing I look for when I get almond milk tea is that they don't have that powdery consistency. Too many places mess up almond milk tea. Not this place. It wasn't too sweet and it didn't taste like powder. Not very high standards to make a review but hey, I'm reviewing tea.Only bad thing is that Tea Station usually runs more expensive than your typical boba joint so be prepared.
3	I think this place has potential to be amazing.  (I have a feeling my 8th grade PE coach used to say the same thing about me as I never was able to do a full pull up back then )  But anywho...  the drinks are great.  This one time I ordered an unsweetened black ice tea with boba.  But I asked the watier to put fresh lychee in it.  (This is not on the menu, and he was confused at the order, but he made it happen!)  It was delicious and the fresh lychee added a slight sweetness to the drink. So I have a boring life and had been talking about this drink for quite some time, and I brought a friend here to try it with me.  Another worker was there, and said I couldn't have this because there is no such thing.  I told her that I have had it before.  That didn't help my argument.  My friend thought I was crazy and I was making orders up.  So I have yet to be back, my heart will break if I can never have this amazing drink again.
3	I recently the Milk Slush tea, caramel flavored with boba. It was ok, nothing amazing. Great Atmosphere, Has about 10-12 tables, servers are prompt, and the drinks come out in a timely manner. They have a  huge selection of teas and food as well.  They also have hot tea, I had the star fruit black tea once. that was really good, especially when i had a sore throat.
3	I love their Thai Tea! Yummy!!!The only concern I have about this place is the location. The parking here sucks! cars are constantly blocking other cars and in the past month, I've witnessed 2 hit and runs.. omg. When I go here, I usually park it next door where the 99 Ranch Market is and walk..... :)
4	The tapioca here are sweeter, milk tea taste better than most
4	I'm being a little generous with the rating. It's more of a 3.5 to 3.75 star rating. I rounded up :P.The food and drink here is consistently decent. The slushes are just the right amount of sweet for me. The boba is nice and chewy with just a little hint of sweetness. I've had the mango shaved ice and green bean shaved ice as well. Both of which were really tasty.The aspect they're really docked down on for me is the service. The workers are really inattentive to their customers when you're sitting down at a table. They don't check up on you, and sometimes you have to flag them down just to put in your order. If you're just ordering to go, they can be pretty speedy even when they're busy. But if you're sitting down, don't come in expecting they're going to be catering to you.Oh, and the parking situation is pretty cramped. If you know you're going during peak times, you should park in the next lot over where the 99 Ranch Market is and walk over.
4	I love their Taro milk tea with boba! It's one of my favorite places for boba in town. I haven't tried many of their flavors since I really enjoy the Taro, but I plan on venturing out and trying something different when I go again.
1	The boubo tea....is soso,but the food is ok... i dont want go back again..
3	Service here are not so great. But who is normally at a tea place for their service anyways. As for their milk tea, it was still very sweet even with 1/3 of sugar. I really wish there tea could be more stronger. Since its too light for my taste.
1	I've been to the Tea Station in LA which was delicious! I came to Vegas January 2012, came to this Tea Station and it reminded me so much of LA. The boba and milk tea was perfect, not too bland, not too sweet.However, I'm not too sure what happened but in my most recent trip to Vegas, we were so excited to get our milk tea. I told my friends about this place so they were all excited to give it a try. As soon as we got up to the door, the workers opened it and started bringing their tables and chairs outside, we weren't even greeted or told politely when the store would open. The worker just blatantly and rudely told us that they are closed. Since we wanted the milk tea so bad, we waited outside in our car until they opened at 11am. Let's just say... my friends weren't satisfied.The man who was working was very rude and giving us attitude (not too sure if it was on purpose or if that was just his fob accent). Their milk tea was extremely sweet. We all drank less than 1/3 of our drinks and thew it away. They used to serve Taiwanese milk tea (which was what I was expecting).. instead, we got Korean milk tea which was way too sweet for our taste. I won't be back. The only Tea Station I'll be going to is the one in LA.
2	The past few visits have been subpar in service and not so friendly so visits have become far less. I haven't been in a long while and last night just did me into not going here. BF and I both ordered our own taro smoothie with pudding. When the guy was scooping into our cups he didn't fill it all the way and once the product sank to the bottom where the pudding was it was more than 1/4th not filled. There was a ton of smoothie left and instead he dumped it all out! I don't get that. Scrooge the customer and waste product. Then when it came to pay, it was $15something (w/o tip).... for two drinks!Their prices definitely has gone up since the last time I was here and it was already on the high side compared to competitors. It's too much to ask for milk, ice, taro powder and pudding. It's busy because it's the trendy Asian late night thing to do....I'm going to look for a different place. I may not be able to have late night boba, but oh, wellsies. I can deal.
4	This is the place to go for bubble tea "taiwanese style" in Vegas!  I'm sure if you drive around town, you will see many many many bubble tea shops, but of all the ones I've been to, Tea Station has to be the most consistent to that Taiwanese flavor some of us yearn for! =)  I kind of swayed away from the bubbles and moved on to getting the custard pudding with my milk tea.  What?!  You never tried it?!  YOU MUST!  It is ohhhh soooo delicious!!  I'd have to say, some of the workers there are pretty rude, and I don't know if it's a culture thing, but being a native speaker, I just had to talk in a demanding way to get what I needed in a quick way (haha).  You Taiwanese people know what I'm talking about!  (To the Americans, it may seem rude, but not in Asia! xP)  As for the food, I have yet to try it.
1	I've frequent this Tea Station multiple times, and sad to say the service has been going down hill, while prices have gone up.  And the last couple of times when being rung up, the amount was incorrectly high in favor of them.  I can understand people make mistakes once in a while, but this is a bit too consistent, makes me think it's being done on purpose.  Hate to think how many people unknowingly got charged extra.
5	Still my fav boba spot...Only updating since I have been trying a lot of their food and snacks.Can't go wrong with the squid balls, taro balls, and sweet potato balls...I guess if it is in ball shape, it is good here!  LOLThe butter toast here is also good, and I have tried some of the desserts.Good place to hang out...order a drink or two, have a snack, and enjoy.
4	I have a dream, that one day I will get the right drink.  The time before last, I ordered a large coffee which came in a bucket size cup.   It was 110 degrees outside and the hot drink made me sweat like a marathon runner on his/her last mile.    This last time, I ordered a strawberry drink that was so sweet that if I added 1/2 cup of sugar, it would taste no different.   However, aside from my bad selections, my friend's drinks were great and the mango ice was refereshing.   So I cannot mark it down for my bad choices.  I will continue with my dream to order accordingly and will soon return.   By the way, do not order the plum/grass ice, it taste as good as it sounds.
3	I was in the area and decided to grab a boba drink since I haven't had any since leaving Orange County.  I guess since I was spoiled by OC's variety of boba shops, just wasn't the same.  I didn't find anything special/interesting on the menu or that stood out.  Overall, the service was very nice and the place had plenty of tables.  Sad to say for parking.. Place is packed with many stores sharing the same lot and it gets pretty crowded during certain hours.  My drink came out and what was expected; wasn't too bad nor impressing. I'll have to try a few more places around the area to really see where Tea Station stands.Side note: parking is a pain.
3	I love using this place as a meeting spot to chat and eat. This Taiwanese restaurant is pretty good and I love their Boba tea drinks. Their Bobas are pretty fresh not rubbery and chewy like other places.. I have been going to this place since high school, and would chill and relax here on the weekends play cards  and socialize. The reason why i gave this 3 star is because their service sucks. They take forever to take your order or to clean up, they don't check on you..Then again what Asian restaurant ever gives good service.  So Im pretty use to it.. I give it a 3 1/2 star too bad Yelp does not do 1/2s.. hehe I would still go back here it's a great place to chill and socialize while grabbing some food and drinks that are pretty good. Just don't expect good service. I highly recommend getting the passion fruit tea and for the food get the pork chops.
2	This is a place for a certain type of person. This type of person must not care about service, blood sugar levels, comfort, or feeling welcome in general. Let me explain.Service - there is no service.Blood sugar levels - I'm sorry, you have diabeetus. They empty one bag of sugar per drink, I'm pretty sure.Comfort - ok, I'm not asking for lavish cushions, but isn't it time to get some better chairs and cushions that aren't worn, and worn, and worn again?Are you welcome? Meh. Maybe. Not if you stay longer than 45 minutes. Especially if you have a bunch of people with you.I will say this to their credit - they have a large menu of drinks, some items you can only get from them. That's cool I guess. Too bad everything else sucks. But you can avoid most of those things by just getting your drink to go. Just maybe tell them easy on the sugar bags.
3	I love sweets but their drinks are too sweet. I recommend asking for your drinks with easy sugar or no sugar. I ordered the rose milk tea no sugar and it wasFabulous. Every other time they pump too much syrup or sugar up a milk tea too much. I know now to just order with no additional sugar.
4	Service was better this time around. Even if it is crappy I still think its the best boba I've had.
4	Got my fix of their Boba Milk Tea, delish as usual !!!!  But tried something new, Passion fruit Shaved Ice w/ lychee, sooo good!!!!  Can't wait to try the other flavors!!!!
3	Its good, service sucks. I wanted mango over shaved ice, a item listed seasonal on the menu, the waiter told me they do not have it.... Hmmm ok, I go with my back up since the mango is labeled seasonal. I order strawberry over shaved ice.... They dont have that either lol. Some one forgot to go fruit shopping I guess.  I wish the waiter would of told me what they did have since that list seemed shorter then what they did not have. I ended up with red bean over rice, it was good but interesting. They also gave my friend the wrong drink, we didn't want to complain, just wanted to pay our bill and leave, but it was hard to track anyone down that  worked there. Overall not too fun.
3	My gal pal and I decided to stop here after dinner to get a boba drink. I had not been here previous and was a bit nervous as to what I should order. I was praying that I did not order a boba drink that I may not like and that would be disappointing.Luckily I finally decided on the rose milk with boba after reviewing the menu which has a lot of beverage options.My drink was the perfect amount of sweet and I truly enjoyed it which was really like a perfect dessert after just having ramen for dinner.The prices are for sure high for what you get, my "small" rose milk with boba was 5.75 which is more expensive than my favorite "large" drink at Starbucks, ouch!!!I will be back after I hit the Lottery or a Vegas Jackpot so that way I can order a large drink to enjoy!
4	Took a star cause it's a bit pricey. I'm from LA, and usually boba and slushies are only like $2.50, but I guess that's just me. And if you end up getting more than just drinks, you end up getting a nice bill too. But, none-the-less, still love this place, and love getting their shaved ice, and their ice jellie drinks (PASSION FRUIT!). Great sip during the summer, have yet to see what i'm going to order during the winter months ;) Maybe i'll try that giant toast that they have :))
2	The quality of food and rinks here has declined considerably. Before the initial impact of Asian restaurants was brand new, the quality at his location was up to par. You can tell they had the energy to launch with high ambitions and a competitive spirit. Now, considering that quite a lot of Asians from this town would sit down anywhere that's got a Taiwanese or Chinese name and menu indiscriminately, it's no wonder that once money starts flowing in, complacency kicks in, as well.
4	Love the taro milk tea with boba.. Huge menu, hot or cold, and food.I only gave it 4 stars because every time I go in there, the service is extremely awful. You sit there waiting for your bill, I'm sure you could walk out without them noticing.. It's kind of sad.The only reason I keep going back is because I like the atmosphere and there are so many yummy flavors to try on the menu.
3	I've been wanting to hit this place up for AGES, but as we pass by after eating ramen, my male always says, "No, you already tea, you don't need more," and steers me away to the car. Out and about with one my girlies, and we finally stopped here for a drink. Holy Crapballs, this place was expensive! I mean, almost 6 bucks for a small iced green tea boba? It's just a bit much. The positives: huge menu of every kind of tea I can think of, and at least a hundred more that I can't. Polite enough service, and the tea was REALLY good. Definitely not a good place for a nice cheap treat though.
3	I changed my two-star rating to a three-star rating because upon reflection...I really do like their teas. However, their service leaves much to be desired. Rarely do I ever feel less welcomed in a restaurant. They're lucky they have such good drinks or else I would be tempted to leave this place and NEVER LOOK BACK! Never look back, I say! The drinks are a bit pricey, but I can't really find any other milk teas around here that taste as good ;T
4	I have Been going to this place since high school and the food and drinks have never disappointed, you got to try the Spicy pork chop if you want a bit to eat or the Taro snow ice if you want a smooth sweet drink! Both are awesome!
1	I ordered a simple tea egg minced pork rice and it took 45 mins for my foo to show up. I had to follow up with a server (who was busy chatting away with other servers) and he seemed surprised that there was such an item on the menu! The order comes in individual bowls/plates for each item. For some reason.. I felt like either they ran out of ingredients or that they shorted my serving size. My minced pork barely filled half the bowl.No one checked on us during the meal so my 8 oz cup of water sat empty for over half the time.It sucks that this is one of the few Taiwanese places available on Vegas. I would not recommend tea station to anyone looking a hassle free meal!!
3	This place is great for having a quick lunch or just to hang out. Although I'm not a big fan of their customer service or for how long they take to bring out your order, their drinks and food are enough to keep me coming. If you're a fan of fruit team (like I am), their Caribbean Fruit tea is a good start. Not too sweet and not bitter.One of my favorite meals to order is their tea flavored teriyaki eel. I love how it comes with soup and three small dishes because it's always something healthy and I always feel full every time.
4	Like that you can choose how much sugar you can have in your drink.
2	Do they have good Boba? YesIs it overpriced? YesAre they rude? Yes and yesTwo stars for the fact that it is good boba but it is a pain to get it and you pay a lot for it.
3	I like the drinks that Teastation offers, but I definitely would not pay the price for regular drinks like boba milk tea or other simple boba drinks, for that I'd rather head out to the other many boba places in town with cheaper prices and portion.BUT I do come here for the Red bean grass jelly drink, which is incomparable to other places that have offered it.Food is okay. Sometimes the side dishes that comes with the meals aren't what said as in the the menu. But the portion of the meals is pretty decent. A good place for lunch, or a hangout with snacks.The only reason I don't like coming here is the extremely slow service if you're at a table. If you want the server to notice you you better be loud and clear to them, because they will walk past you and chit-chat with their other co-workers.They're only fast when you order drinks to go.The place gets extremely busy in the late hours, as a lot of college students come here to hang out.
3	High hopes for an amazing experience, but it turned out to be mediocre. Went on a Friday night. Parking was a pain in the butt. Not enough spaces. The interior was well decorated. Was really busy. I only saw three employees: guy behind counter and two girls working the floor. Both girls wore budges that said "trainee". They were too busy to seat us, so we grabbed our own table. They have a rule, each guest must spend at least $4 every 3 hours. apparently they have a problem with people sitting up there all night without spending money. We ordered an appetizer of wontons. They were okay, not amazing. Main dish was soup with tea flavored noodles and beef. Was okay, not amazing. We could not taste the tea. We finished with a large green tea boba. We had such high hopes, but it was mediocre as well. We ordered two glasses of ice water right after sitting down. I asked for the waters at least three more times. They served one glass for me and my wife. I had to ask for the second glass and they eventually brought the second glass. The waters finally arrives after all the other items were served. Way under staffed. Do they ignore water orders on purpose to encourage ordering their premium beverages? There were people waiting for a table, but the servers were too busy to ring us out. After waiting for a long time I grabbed a server and drug her over to the register. Overall, the place was okay, not amazing. Food and drinks were mediocre. Way under staffed.
4	I love the drinks here! The best in town, and I have been to quite a few.  Pretty pricey, if you ask me. But sooo Good. Love  the hot taro milk tea:) The only reason, I didn't give 5 stars is because of the service. Sometimes they were very good and kind and other times they are just down right rude! Most of them can't speak English so it is difficult to understand and you have to get their attention to order or they will never go up to you. For the most part, I don't have an issue when I go there. A story: My bf were doubling dating with my sis and her bf. After dinner, we decided to come here. Everyone was stuffed, so my sister and I each ordered hot tea. We just wanted to relax and talk. The place was not busy at all. There were many open tables. The guy serving us said that if we wanted to dine in, each of us had to order something that was 4 dollars or more!! Seriously?! What kind of policy is that?? I go to this place so much and have never heard of such a thing. Long story short, we ended up ordering more things because I wanted the tea! lol But he was very rude to us after I tried telling him I never heard of  that rule before.  I wonder if anyone has had this problem?so if you willing to forget about the service (once in a while) Then go try out some awesome boba!!!
2	In all honesty I do not know why my friends and I always come here whenever we visit Vegas. The service is horrible, price jacked up, and taste not as good as the drinks in SoCal. Why do I even put up with paying $4+ on a boba milk tea? UghMaybe my friends are just obsessed with boba and cannot leave it behind for even a weekend. Since this was the first boba place we discovered in Vegas we have an affinity for this wrenched establishment. 1 star for quality. 1 star for familiarity. That is all. Please let us find another boba joint that is legit for our Vegas trips!
3	Drinks here are really good the only thing that bothers me is their service. Every time I go the waiters are always really rude and I always forget that you must order at least $10.00 worth of food and beverages to use your debit/credit card. I never carry cash so this is very annoying to me. The food here is not the best I would recommend you stick to their beverage menu and go eat somewhere else in Chinatown.
3	I had never been to Tea Station, but have pased it many time in China town over the years. I like Tea, I am not a fam of Boba so much.. but I figured maybe I would give it a try based on some friends that wanted to drop in. I had a green tea Boba.. nothing wrong with it.. tasted like hardcore green tea (which I really like) and then some Boba. Maybe I don't have the finer palate required to .. drink.. slurp.. chew? Boba? lol.. Someday I am sure will go back and try something else.. for now my curiosity is satisfied. The other guests in the place seemed to really liek it.. and the staff was prompt and energetic.. lol.
1	I suggest that if you have terrible service then you better have rock star boba to make up for it. Unfortunately for Tea Station, this isn't the case. Boba is okay. Their coffee ice cream with is good for you java lovers. The rest of their menu is simply okay as well. Their tea boiled eggs satisfies a salty craving. Their toasts are bit on the dry side. The only upside to this place is that they're open late and it's convenient to hang out after a delicious dinner somewhere in Chinatown. To-go service is a joke. You might as well come in, sit down, have a grand ol' time and leave. You stand around with a looking like a deer in the headlights while the servers ignore you or give you the dreadful finger telling you to "hold on". But then again, you might not want to sit down because it'll take them forever to come to your table. And then when you come to your table they're really rude. I always feel rushed to order. They don't explain things well. I'm not the one to complain. I have a lot of patience. Takes a lot to put me over the edge. Kudos to you, Tea Station. You have done just that.
4	I've been going to this place for years.  Buried in the heart of China town, it offers some of the best teas in town.  I've always brought friends in to try the hot taro milk tea and boba.  A friend of mine so lovingly calls it "cookie tea".  I recommend it to every one.They have a strange atmosphere, but sometimes I think you have to be willing to blend.  Just like visiting a different country, going into a restaurant with a different culture can be an experience.  I think this is what all the reviews are talking about when they mention the service.  Are they friendly?  No.  Are they accommodating?   Certainly not.  Do they try to be?  Not at all.  And I can respect that.So long as they serve up quality tea I can't find elsewhere, I'll be back.
4	don't get their teas less sweet.tastes like water.i still like their coconut milk tea, lavender milk tea.they have a special for $3.50 on regular or green milk tea right now.
4	I had the strawberry pudding boba tea. It was pretty good. Not too sweet. I wanna go back and try more flavors.
2	I'll make this simple...This place is a shame. I don't understand; their main business is to serve tea and yet the tea is bad?
3	Stopped by this place picking up Boba milk tea. we stopped in because we went up stairs at Crown Bakery to pickup some pastries to bring back and wanted a nice dessert drink.The place overall is nice and clean, service was quick & fast. I really like my Milk tea because it had a very strong tea flavor. Some places, you can't even taste the tea. Wish it was a little bit sweeter though. The boba was cooked perfectly how i Liked it.price on the other hand was a little bit much for what I pad. I probably won't be coming back here in the future.
3	service could be better, or maybe i am used to service back in 626?tea was alright, too much ice.
4	The tea here is very good. Particularly the Jasmine blossom tea which is a flower that opens up at the table in a see thru pot. My only complaint is that the wait staff at night time is much better than the day staff. Also, it is much less crowded during the night so after 8 pm is honestly premium.
5	Best Milk Tea and Boba in the US. Winner.
2	I'll start by saying we didn't eat here, we just wanted refreshments on a hot day!  The place is cute, clean and I would've thought about going back to have something to eat if ever in the area.  But, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, "what u like?"  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a "hello".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! I had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.  Call me spoiled . . .
2	I would give a 2.5 I went here when it was stupid busy, hard to find parking, went I got inside it was super toasty, like I felt so hot I couldn't think, the music was to loud for me, made it hard to think to, I eventually choose some random drink, cause I was so hot. Then left.
3	I don't like that you can't just hang out here, you have to actually make a purchase of a minimum of $5 or they kick you out. Overall, cute little tea place that's open until 2am.
2	This is my second time coming here and I dont  plan coming back. Although the drinks are delicious, the service is the worst. My friends and I were only allowed 40 minutes to order even though there was still an hour left on the clock. Our waiter spent half of our 40 minutes ignoring us. After finally getting his attention and order we tells us they're out of boba. What?! I work at a boba place in California and we will make boba or any drink even if it is 5 minutes before closing. Our customers are very important to us and are given great service, it makes them happy and more likely to come back.  I wasn't able to finish my taro slushy so I asked a waitress nearby if I could have a to go cup, and I'm not lying my friend Lia noticed this as well, the waitress rolls her eyes, flipped her head and makes a sound. I was like woah! JUST BEYOND RUDE! Although this place has convenient hours in las Vegas' Chinatown and yummy drinks, this place really doesn't know the meaning of customer appreciation and good service.
2	Terrible/Awkward setup.Drinks taste "old" and stale.Prices are high compared to other spots.Redeeming factor is the glassware if you get your drink "for here" (yeah I'm fancy).I wouldn't go back.
1	The service is so bad, I never even got to order, so I can't comment on the food or drinks. Twenty minutes and no one bothered to take our order.
1	You can tell the tea isn't fresh. It tastes like it's been sitting there all day. Compared to their other branches, this one doesn't compare. The service is not up to par because the waiters/waitresses tend to talk amongst themselves sometimes and end up ignoring the customers. I only go there because they use the Ten Ren branded tea. Even though they offer free Wi-Fi, it never works. They always tells us it's down. The price is more expensive too.
2	It's the second time I've walked out of this place. Every time i come here the service has gotten worse. When it's been 20mins and you're still waiting on someone to take your order, it's time to leave. It's not cause they were busy. They were just chit chatting with each other and on their cell phones. When other groups come in later and they get to take their orders before you. Yeah. Don't think I'll be dining here much more. Granted their tea is good. Only reason why they still get stars from me.
1	When I walked in with my friend, nobody was there and the waitresses chose to ignore us. We ordered our drinks and my drink came out very bitter so I asked for more syrup in there. The tea maker literally took of my lid and squeezed in the syrup. He seemed so mad and unwillingly to do anything even though he had nothing to do. When we left, everyone chose to ignore us once again and continued to chat away.  Horrible service.
5	The blend of the tea was perfect.  You don't taste the powder of the tea and the boba is boiled to perfection.
2	Boba and food is good, but the service is terrible. Been going here for 4 years and it hasn't changed.
2	I don't know if we go up and order or what? When we walked in, it was a little busy.  It was EDC weekend so there were a lot of people that looked like they were stopping by to get some Boba.  We easily were able to seat ourselves at an available table.  It look like there were about 2 servers on the floor.  Let me tell you, they kept passing us up and even served other tables that sat down after us.  It was probably a good 15 minutes before they recognized we had no menus.  That was until we finally said, "Umm, yes we are here, can we get menus?"  I ordered a hot medium cup of mango tea.  It was really delicious.  Overly priced, for sure.  It was $4 for a cup of tea.  Good tasting tea, but not knock my socks off let me spend another $4 for a cup of tea.  eeeeh, I've definitely had better service and tea.
1	Visited this Tea Station for the first time in Vegas. Came here for an quick lunch before heading home.The food- Microwave, microwave and more microwave.. If they were not microwaved, they must be really good making their food taste like microwaved food.... The drink is ok... Taste very watered down.... The service- what service? We came in right after they opened, NOBODY was in the store, we still had to stand for aobut 5 min before anyone achnowledged us.... After seating, the table and chairs are sticky.... The waitress spoke English which we couldn't undertand, but the accent is obvious China-ish. So we started speak Mandarin to her. Of course the service is still not better.. Obvious this store is run by people from China.. which has no service concept at all....When to go the cold drink, they gave us a styrofoam cup...I asked why don't you guys use paper cup for more environmental friendly or plastic cup at least we can recycle... The answer is because it cost cheaper for them....Not a good business practice.
3	Wows, Tea Station. Your milk tea is expensive. As is your food. The milk teas are good though; I really have no complaints about it other than the price. This place is also open late, which is a plus because sometimes you just don't want fast food late at night! The tables are really oddly set up, and they really need to figure out a system with their "To-Go" and "Dine-In" people. Also, where the cash register is located is really odd as well, it's really an inconvenience if you're sitting at that table behind it! Sit against the wall, but not near the door on cold nights!
4	I've had some great tea and food from Tea Station. The Rose Milk Tea w/ Boba is a must as is the Strawberry Jelly Ice. I'd also recommend the Sweet Butter Toast for a snack. The stuff is legitimately some of the best you'll have.Now I have to explain why I take a star off. The staff is kind but they take a very long time to serve you. Perhaps it's a cultural thing that I am ignorant of, but the staff prioritizes everything over the dine-in patrons. You're better off ordering to-go and sitting down in the restaurant. Overall 3 1/2 stars. I am a repeat customer here, so it's worth visiting.
4	Thai tea - bolba..good stuff.  Bonus that's it's open really late because I work graveyards.  I'll definitely hit this place up at least once a week!!!!
4	I think I am in between 3 and 4 stars. Service is 3 stars, but their milk tea boba's are amazeballs and deserve 5star from me! Love it!
2	I got an almond milk tea and it was WAY too sweet. The prices are also pretty high.
3	Their boba is delicious but service could really improve. Not quite attentive or friendly, especially when it gets a little crowded. I suggest the Matcha Green Tea w/ Boba. Comes with a generous amount of green tea ice cream on top of your actual drink.
4	I bring my Gf here once or twice a month, we have sort of a tradition to go here and order a large thai tea boba in the glass mugs. We sort of found out that the boba tastes sweeter when in the glass mug opposed to the plastic to-go cup, don't know if it really is a difference aha, but we think so.Inside is ok, can be full at times and you may have to stand or wait for a seat, customer service is average sometimes slow but we don't mind.
1	Late review.Will not be going to this place again.  Not a fan.  I ordered simple Milk Tea w/ boba.  Some boba was not soft and chewy, but hard.  The milk tea tasted like sugar water. I even had my daughter taste it since it's her FAVORITE kind of drink and she didn't even want it.
3	Not as great as the boba tea back home in L.A but good enough for when I come to vegas.  I did think they were a little pricey though but I love boba so this will be my vegas spot and their open late!. Matcha milk was really good and I tried the honey dew one also really good my son got the passion fruit smoothie which I also really really enjoyed even though it was really sweet., but I was confused a little about the place though it looks like a order and leave  type of place  I guess it's also a restaurant and they don't really have an area to stand for to go orders so you feel like you're in the way. Oh! and  and the parking... is terrible.
3	great boba but customer service is not as good.had a friend come here and got a wrong order for a drink when there was only two of us. but great boba.
4	So happy..i Can have milk tea at vegas. Lol
1	Our drinks tasted fine, however i am here for the service. or lack there of.There were about eight of us and we all ordered different drinks with different sugar levels. The girl taking our order did a fine job with that - she didn't mix anything up. Once they handed us our drinks, it was a different story. Let me ask you this; if a group orders a bunch of different drinks, wouldn't it be common sense to label the cups so that they know which is which? When we asked her which drinks were which, she took a "guess" and then told us "why don't you just sip each cup and then you will know" - I've never had anyone tell me that at a Tea Station and trust me, i've been to plenty. I will gladly donate a box of sharpies for them to write down the names if needed.& don't even get me started on the whole stamp card policy.
4	This is one of Tea Stations small locations but it meets the standard of any Tea Station I have been to. The employees were nice and remembered who ordered what drinks. I ordered a large Thai Tea with boba to-go. It tasted like I expected it to.
1	There's another tea station in Northern California where I am from that is very busy and popular. So I decided to give this location a try since it's something familiar. WORST DECISION. It took us ten minutes to order because apparently the cashier doesn't know enough English. When it came to my turn to order, the cashier kept asking me unnecessary questions and confusing my order as well. Seriously? It should be straight forward when I am reading from the menu and telling you exactly what I want-milk tea with pearls regular size. How complicated is that?.....we will not be coming back. It seems like everyone that was inside at the time was only there to take advantage of their free wifi.....
3	Its Tea Station.. The ambience is that of a coffee shop but less douche-y. They have games but many pieces are missing. We order boba it comes out quick but its not cold which is  a little disappointing for me. Their boba was on a shortage so when my friend asked for extra she was told with a firm maybe depending on supply it was still relatively early so that was kind of disappointing. She did however end up getting extra boba. So score one for us. The waitress wasn't paying attention so one of us got a regular drink when she in fact ordered a large. Nothing here majorly off putting but small little nuisances throughout. I'm not in a rush to return to tea station but i'm not opposed to it either. Its still a nice place to sit and enjoy boba, just dont expect to be wow'd.
3	Okay so I've been to Tea Station very many times and have probably adapted to their style of service. Sometimes they are understaffed, but I prefer to go in the daytime when it's not too busy because parking can get pretty terrible. There's also the option of getting a couple drinks to go. If you come with a group, they do expect most of your group to buy something. I also believe there is a $10 credit card minimum (before tip), so if you don't plan on spending that much be sure to bring cash. This place is also fairly overpriced for both food and drinks. We've tried a couple of the small food dishes, but I don't believe they are worth the price you pay.Regardless of all this, we've returned time and time again because they do make great drinks! I've been to multiple similar restaurants and have not found many that make perfectly flavorful and frothy Thai Tea as the one I buy at Tea Station. I've also tried at least 15 different drinks here (iced tea, hot tea, snow ice, etc.) and have yet to feel disappointed.So in summary, I would suggest that you only come here for drinks and try your best to avoid busy hours. But I really don't think this place is as bad as many of these reviews make it out to be. As a side note, I've actually been to a Tea Station in California where the restaurant had a much better setup and improved customer service. I definitely preferred the California TS, but for now I don't really mind the troubles of attending this one.
2	Oh Tea Station, where shall I begin? You and I were pretty good friends when we started to get to know each other, but then like an abusive ex gf, you started showing your bad points really quickly. I have been going to this place for months but after sampling other boba tea places around the area, I now know there are better places where customers are actually treated with respect. Why do I have to bring up respect when talking about a cafe? Because it has all to do with service. Or lack thereof in this case. There are two wait staff members here, a boy and a girl, who always seem to be giving not only me but other customers a hard time when ordering drinks. I even experimented different ways to order drinks (Pointing to the drinks on the drink counter, speaking slowly and enunciating each word, learning Taiwanese (Okay, maybe not the last one but I might as well have)) to lower the aggravation or pissy meter off of these wait staff members. Nothing works. They will often get annoyed or angry that you can't get your order right the first time. I have worked front of the house in cafes before larger than this establishment and I have not once showed signs the level of discontent or disrespect these guys show. It's gotten from me being embarrassed thinking I made a mistake to being embarrassed that they don't know how to do customer service. Probably the only constructive criticism I can say is to retrain these two wait members or get a touch screen so you can punch in your own orders to save time, money, and customers. But enough of the bad, the good is that their drinks are consistently good and there are some very good helpful members of their team like the older pudgy guy who usually mixes the drinks or the young short girl who always seem happy to have a job.I would give this place one star if it wasn't for the consistency of their food and drinks. Remember, people will go out to eat at places with good food and drink but they will only comeback if there is good service to match.My advice? Why take the abuse? Try Volcano Tea House or Fresh Cup down the street. At least they won't chastise you for messing up your order or nag you on it.
1	Service was slow... We were standing at the register for like 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged us!  We ordered the Taro and Almond Boba and it was nothing special!
1	Tea was not bad. However service just fail everytime i visit. They either got my drink wrong n argued it was my fault or made me wait for my drinks when actually my order was not passed to the one preparing the drink. N it so happened that whenever i was facing these problems, there were also customers facing problems n asking for refunds. The staffs needa work out a better system.
1	This place has horrible service! That's straight to the point! Never coming here again!!!! Not worth the aggravation!!
4	$5 for cup of boba tea is a bit pricy but it's pretty good. Quality over quantity.
1	Caution: This place discriminates against Caucasians. My son and I purchased our drinks and sat down to enjoy. Not even 5 minutes later an Asian waitress in glasses came to our table and asked us to leave saying the seating is limited and was needed for other customers. My son and I were the only Caucasians in this place. There were other Asians seated when we entered the store and no one asked any of them to leave. Clearly there was preferential treatment. I have never been so humiliated in my life. This establishment should be ashamed for its outrageous practices.
4	authentic taiwanese milk tea boba! i love the jasmine green milk tea here, it tastes just like taiwan's :) i recently tried the food here too and it was pretty good! there's usually a ton of taiwanese people here either dining in or picking up to-go, the workers here are mostly taiwanese too or chinese. overall, the service is quick and easy and the place is comfortable and clean. i can see myself bringing my laptop and having lunch by myself here. the only thing i don't like is they charge additional fee when you order to-go. wtf? but other than that, i recommend this place.
5	It's a little busy but a cool spot. I dig the vibe...casual. Ordered the Rose Milk Tea and its amazing! Also, the fried won tons...yum!
1	My drink was actually okay and I can't complain about that.  My issue with them is that they will not stamp your stamp card unless you pay using a gift card. WTF kind of stupid policy is that!  Maybe LA and Vegas have different policies but I know for sure the multiple Tea Stations do not have that policy.  Other thoughts, boba wasn't as chewy as I like it to be.  The Taro bbtea was EXTREMELY powdery and was the worst that I've had. Maybe it was a one time thing but I wont be coming back to find out.
3	Service here is horrible. Food is good. But I get so upset with the servers at times. They're neglectful, slow, and a bit rude. Try Number 1 Boba instead (inside the mall next door) or Wendy's (not the fast food joint) down the road on Jones.
1	I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, "hey, let's go to tea station!" Icy juicy will provide a much better service.
1	Stopped by today for a quick grab of Boba tea for the first time, but will not be coming back.  I had the toughest time ordering my drink because she did not speak much English, after about 5 minutes of trying to order a simple tea drink with boba, I left.  No one  bothered to step in to help her out.
1	The food is alright along with the drinks. My friends and I like to come here to catch up and hang out and for the boba.  I think what bothers me the most is the terrible service. The staff is always hanging out in the counter talking the day away. I've been coming here for years now and as the years go by the service gets worst every time. I've had to get up from my table a few times just to their attention. It just makes not want to come back
1	I dont normally post any reviews for anything. As a matter of fact i even forgot my password to my yelp acct. The service is so fcken shitty here i actually went through the resetting of password process to post this.
1	I wish I could give zero stars. This place is such a joke. They have HORRIBLE customer service & overpriced food/drinks. I came in last night for some milk tea because I was next door at Zizzy & it was more convenient than driving 5 mins to Icy Juicy. Big mistake. I should have just driven further away for cheaper milk tea & better customer service. Anyways, I came in to place an order to go & stood at the counter for about 10 mins as 2 employees ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. Only 1 acknowledged me & said "sorry for the wait" but still proceeded to help everyone sitting at the tables instead of the line at the counter.This isn't even the first time I've encountered their crap service. Definitely won't be back. For cheaper food & boba check out Volcano Tea in the next plaza or Icy Juicy on Jones & DI!!
2	I try to avoid this place as much as I can. Although I am in love with their Rose Milk Tea with grass jelly, I cannot stand how terrible their customer service is. One time it took them 30 minutes to get our orders after being seated. RIDICULOUS right? I guess if you have all the time in the world and you don't mind getting your order in an hour then this is the place for you.
1	I made a Yelp account just so I could review this place and warn other people how HORRIBLE this place is. First of all, the drinks tasted like they were made with powder. Gross. Second, the boba was so hard I couldn't eat them. Also, when we ordered, we specifically said "To Go" but they gave us the glass cups instead. So when we clarified the second time it was to go, they gave us plastic cups and told us to pour it out ourselves. Also, after seating us, and after being seated for about fifteen minutes, the waiter then told us to get up and move down because he needed to seat other guests. I was tired of the lousy customer service so we got up to pay, and we stood in front of the register for a good ten minutes while the waiters just kept walking past us. One of them even bumped into me. NEVER EVER EVER coming back here. It is way over priced. Spent $50 for the WORST customer service experience I've ever had. That's $50 I'm never going to get back. If I could, I would give this place no stars at all. They are so rude. DO NOT COME HERE! Go to Icy Juicy down the street, it is much much better. This place is ridiculous.
3	Although it is really nice to be able to eat and drink stuff from Tea Station while visiting Las Vegas, this location can work on Its cleanliness.We got beef stew to go, and the soup and food was pretty good.  I had to skip out on the tapioca drink, but my friends enjoyed theirs.  The downside was that I had to use their restroom, and the restroom was dirty all over.  There was not even any toilet paper in sight - not even in their opened storage cabinet.  The "soap dispenser" was a poorly opened huge commercial-sized jug that you have to lift and pour soap out of.  It was not a pleasant experience, and yet I felt that the bathroom is something they could easily spruce up.So come to eat and drink here, but try to avoid using the ladies' room!
2	you are way way wrong on the prices, you must be filty rich! a cup of nasty-ass Jasmine tea that tastes like sewer water is friggin $6.00. Everything is way way too expensive, this joint is ripping Asians off blind. Although the service is impeccable, and quick, tables are cleaned immediately, and customer service is great, This is what you are paying for!!!!   Lots of 18 and 19year olds standing around the counter to go-orders, lots of older couples cheating on their lovers 'under the radar'  be afraid be very afraid....
3	I don't think I chose the right tea that day.  I chose an iced mango tea and it was okay.  I do like that you can hang out in this place.  There's a good amount of seats to chillax with friends, which is what we did for almost two hours.  I would definitely have to go back and try more stuff because their menu is extensive.
2	Worst service ever. Food/tea is mediocre to terrible. Not sure how this place stays open....Best thing about this TS is the outside seating and location.
4	After dinner,  I went here since I had a violent craving for boba tea. It quickly became an impromptu UYE when a few fellow Yelpers arrived. They have more room here than most boba tea places I've been to.They have interesting items on the menu but since we already ate, I only had room for boba tea. I couldn't decide what I wanted: lavender, rose, Thai or something else. My original choice (lavender milk tea, I believe) can only be served hot so I went with Thai milk tea with boba.The black balls were warm, soft and chewy. The flavor on the Thai tea was just right. It's about $5 for a medium and about $6.25 for a large milk tea but a certain person hooked me up since it was my first time at Tea Station.The only concern I have is the parking. Let's all hold hands and be thankful I wasn't driving that night.
2	I used to come here a lot. It sucks that I did, but it was convenient and the shaved ice was very traditional Chinese/Taiwanese style, which I craved for. However, Tea Station's ill-mannered service and absurd prices bring this place down to 2 stars. I would give them 1, but it's not like I've found a hair in my food.1) Service: I don't know what it is with the attitudes of these girls, but it seems like they wake up on the wrong side of the bed every morning. If food service isn't for you, find a new job. Don't expect us to deal with your unpleasant attitudes; it truly ruins the dining experience.2) Food: Mediocre at best, yet they charge ~$8 for a tea and has a $5 "sit down" price? What is that?Don't waste your time here. There are much better places around Chinatown to satisfy your boba/shaved ice cravings.
4	Tea Station is reminiscent of Ten Ren's in NYC. Their lychee green tea is just as good. I had the lychee snow ice two days in a row :)
4	Best boba in vegas! However their prices are a little outrageous. The staff has never been overly rude to me, but their customer services skills can sometimes be lacking. Saying that, the gentleman that greeted me as I walked in the door the other day was pleasant and I think it was the first time I was ever greeted.
3	The food and tea is always spot on! Definitely a hidden gem. The only reason I would give it 3 stars is because of the staff. Possibly understaffed and they Always seem to be a little confused.
1	Service is really bad.  I do not recommend everybody to come.  Especially the old ladys service.  She will drop the dishes on the table and leave.
4	love their ice cream mocha!! its taste better with pudding
4	This place is a good place eat and catch up with friends. I really like their Honey Milk Green Tea with Boba, it never disappoints. The only thing I didn't like is the parking in the area is just horrible, its such a pain, you literally have to drive around it and wait until someone leaves to take their spot.
4	This is the perfect place to catch up with an old friend because nothing says friendship like tea.It's a tad on the pricier side, but the teas are amazing. It's worth it. Try the ginger tea. No caffeine, but it comes out piping hot and sits well on a cold winter day like the ones we are currently experiencing.The shaved ice is bomb too! The only downside (and same goes for anything in the building) is that the parking sucks. That's the only thing holding it back from a 5 star in my opinion...but it is what it is.
1	The owner really need to fire all these kids! I don't know why they r working here if all they do is horsing around and ignore the customers. A drink should not take 25 mins to make. That's no excuse. Starbucks is a million times busier and my drink came out in less than 5 mins. Last of all, don't expect me to tip u after u gave me an attitude!!!! I want to find out who owns this joint and make a complaint.
1	The second time in a month that I went there and they ran out of Green tea ice cream. They should know by now that they sell a lot of those. So stock it!!!! Tonight was packed. So I decided to order to-go instead. No more ice cream, fine, I'll get just regular milk green tea. I gave them a card and they don't accept a card under $10. I said my bf is picking me up I'll get cash from him. He said "I can't put an order in before you pay. It will take only a few second to make it" yeah of course it's fast to make it but I waited like 10mins to get someone to take my order. I was craving for something sweet and quick. If I had time to sit down, I wouldn't come to this place. Every time I come here service sucks. Last time I ordered two appetizers, greentea noodle, two glasses of tea. And they forgot my apps!
5	I have gone here only a few times, since I'm more of a fresh fruit smoothie with boba type of girl; but when I'm craving milk tea, this is the place to go. Everytime I'm here, I always get the honey milk green tea with boba. It's absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend it. Since I have never actually eaten here before, or even sat down (I always get my tea to go), I cannot vouch for their customer service. But I can say that they are definitely fast in getting my tea ready (then again, I always end up going when it's not busy). So I guess I could say that my rating for this place is really for the milk tea.
4	While visit Las Vegas, we usually find our way to the LV Chinatown a few times.  This visit we stopped at Tea Station twice and got our favorite drinks.  The TOGO counter was not busy this time and we were served quickly, then waited for 5 to 7 minutes for our drinks to be made.  I like green tea with boba and less sugar.  My friend got the milk green tea with less sugar.  One word: Delicious!!During a quick search, I did see some other options for drinks in Chinatown, but we seem to always come back to the old standard - Tea Station.  My only gripe is that the drinks are getting pricey (around $8 or $9 for two drinks).Xie Xie!!
1	This place sucks. We were looking for a quick place to grab some boba and popcorn chicken and this happens to be the closest one so we made a stop. We have a Tea Station back home so we were kinda expecting a good experience. This place has ample seatings, which was nice. I like how detailed their menu is but this is where all the good stuff stops.Our party of 5 ordered popcorn chicken and different kinds of drinks. When our drinks came, we were quite disappointed. I had the passion fruit green tea w/ aloe vera and I tasted no passion fruit. It tasted very bland and watered down. They gave a lot of aloe vera which is great, I guess, but I would prefer to have my tea taste more flavorful! I tried one of my friend's drink which was an almond milk tea and that also tasted like water w/ just a hint of flavor. It wasn't milky or sweet like what an almond milk tea should taste like. Our orders of popcorn chicken came out with no sweet & sour sauce. I've been to so many different places before and isn't it just normal that popcorn chicken should come with sweet & sour sauce without us having to ask? Tell me I'm not expecting too much here. But it's okay, we asked for some. Although we had 2 orders of the popcorn chicken among 5 people, the girl brought out one small dipping sauce expected to be shared. Ugh, skimpy much? Anyways, pass!
4	Been here a few times during our late night excursions in Chinatown. This has been our go-to spot for last minute get togethers with friends. Pros:- fairly cheap- open late, (until 2:00am)The first time around, I tried the hot Mango Black Tea. I couldn't finish it, as It was a little too sweet for my taste. After trying a few of the other selections on the menu, I settled on the Pineapple coconut yogurt snow ice boba as my new favorite drink here. The sweet butter toast is pretty addicting, and to me, it is a lighter version of toasted pound cake with butter. I could eat a whole loaf of that stuff! Cons:- Parking is horrible - I sometimes end up parking in the lot next door- It can get crowded, and if you're sitting in the front area, it feels like the tables are too close togetherSummary: Yes, we'll be back!
5	I visited Vegas during Christmas. I found this place in Chinatown. I love their Special House Milk Tea with boba and aloe vera jelly :3 the service was ok, notthing to complain about. Definitely come back when I come back Vegas :3
3	This place is located in China town in a very popular part of town. I love their milk tea boba and mango slush. The workers are kind of weird and don't really have manners. I still go here often despite the service. It's a good place to hang out.
3	I find myself here once a week. Would be a great place if the service was half descent.  However the service plain old sucks and the servers are no help they speak Zero english. Other then that not bad tea.
3	I was greeted kindly and shown a table to take a seat.  They gave me a menu. I've never had table service at a boba spot before.  They served my tapioca milk tea in a glass mug. It is uncomfortable to drink from. I would have preferred the to go cup. I'm not drinking a beer!  It came out too sweet and not as milky as I like.  The tapioca was initially hard and chewy. But then later some were more soft and the way I like. Not perfect, and not terrible. The fried spicy chicken was nice and hot.  Cooked just right. Very seasoned and crunchy. Overall nice. Oh my the sweet butter toast arrives. And all I can think is, "The smell is DIVINE!"  It is nice and sweet.  Has a bit of a crunch. It is very reminiscent of an Asian bakery.  I came alone and I eat pretty light. This was plenty food for me.
4	It's honestly the best boba we have here in LV. Though the service can definitely improve, their drinks are always consistent which I like. I love boba milk green tea and would recommend it to any newcomers to boba.
4	Rose Milk green Tea w/ boba is incredible!
4	As some other reviewer's mentioned. Parking here IS a nightmare. And, the people in the next parking lot get super pissed if you park and walk over. So, good luck! Try coming on an off hour. It gets really packed at night!The boba menu is very extensive. I've only visited once, but tried three different kinds: coconut, lychee and barley. All were wonderful. Also got the blooming jasmine tea. Tea lasts forever and they will continue refilling with hot water forever!TIP: ask for half sugar. The boba drinks here are super sweet. I went with a friend who frequents this spot and he knew to ask for 1/2 sugar. It was still very very sweet. Can't imagine what they taste like with full sugar.
2	Only here because someone else wants boba. This place sounds like a great idea but once I was here eating and say the chef come out of the kitchen and she was picking her teeth & went back to work. Gross. Parking is always a nightmare. The service is always pretty fast so they get two stars
3	For those who would want a break from your usual Tapioca Express or Tea N More across the street, Tea Station is a lovely cafe to have some tea and unwind. Their selection of teas is tremendous and is one of the few tea places I know in LV that carries tea beyond just black or green or jasmine. And they're served in little teapots!The decor is clean and inviting. The staff is mostly nice. I've only had one run in where a staff member seemed frazzled but I'll chalk it up to being her first day. The food is not something I'd bank on. I've only had their snacks, so I can't comment on real meals as of yet. But they're all right seeing as the primary focus is the tea.A variety of drinks are available also as they have a large menu. Try the thai iced tea or the green tea ice cream drink. Both very tasty. A tip to the wise: Order loose leaf teas so that you could refill on hot water over and over again.
4	Ma-Cha Ice Cream milk tea !  The Taro milk tea is also delicious .  Huge menu selection for smoothies, hot/cold teas, many various flavored such as honeydew, winter melon, apple, mango and passion fruit just to name a few.  I come religiously for the Ma-Cha ice cream milk tea, it actually has a scoop of green tea ice cream in it.They also have a large menu with a variety of tea flavored foods which I've never tried, so this review is relevant to the drinks only.I've had the shaved ice a few years ago and it was decent enough, however I do really enjoy their milk teas.  There are a couple if regular employees who will shape your straw into a cute heart and are extremely nice. One negative is parking, if you go during peak dining hours expect to wait at least 15 min before you find parking.  But definitely worth the wait!
2	This place has a WIDE selection of Boba tea's and food to go with it! Although the food and drinks are superb - Service can be a drag.. I mean I'll be waiting 10+min for a damn drink that takes less than 2 to make.... plus the customer service could use some work. I've been in this industry for 8+ years and this has def. hit the bottom of the barrel.... No one smiles, no one says thank you... Plus they all seem like they HATE their jobs... IF i choose to return it will def be consumed outside or to go to avoid any attitude...
2	I don't know his name but the guy taking to-go orders was so rude to my group and I. We were walking in and I went to get a boba tea and the guy was like, "is this your party?" I was like, "yes." "Are you sure? This whole party is yours?" I confirmed again. It seemed like it was an issue even though I told him we were getting to go. So I told him what I wanted and he have me my amount so I take out my wallet and he's like, "do you have cash? make sure you have cash."I looked at him like, "I do?"Why would he say that as he gives me my total even though he there's no sign or anything? He said it really rude too.Luckily my boba was delicious or I'd burn this place to the ground.  I doubt I'll be coming back. People at Volcano Tea are nicer.
4	Tea Station is a good place if you're looking for a quick pick me up when its late at night. I usually go here with my friends before we hit the Vegas nightlife scene or after we have had dinner. It gets busy around 9pm-11pm. The atmosphere is very casual and. Their service has gotten better than when I first came in 2-3 years ago. The staff is more attentive and conversant than before. They have a wide variety of teas to choose from; as well as various food items. I like to order their taro milk tea with boba.
4	In LV, this is likely the best spot for Tea.Although a franchise,  I love the tea, no boba or other add ins.The best thing: Osmanthus tea, half sweet.Friends liked the popcorn chicken, peach black tea, and Matcha milk tea with green tea ice cream.Bathrooms aren't very clean (separate for men and women)  Cash and credit card accepted.   Am definitely coming back! Love!
2	I'm giving this place 2 stars because I love their coconut milk tea and their brown sugar milk tea (although it is a little too sweet for my taste, so I always make sure to tell them to only use half sugar), however, my experience here was not a good one. Most of the staff is just okay, but one guy in particular (don't know his name), was very rude to me and my boyfriend's family. We sat down at a table and I ordered our boba drinks in TO GO cups, and we ordered the squid jerky to eat there. I usually never finish my boba drink quickly; I take my time and sip on it, so I always order it in a TO GO cup so I can take it with me when I leave. Anyway, when the waiter brought our drinks to the table, they were in regular glass cups, not TO GO cups like I had ordered. I told the waiter and he said, "well it's okay like this." And then he walked away. Needless to say, I did not tip.
3	I usually just come here for the boba. My usual order is Honey Dew snow ice with egg pudding. & i never go wrong with that. But today we decided to order food. We had ordered--Pork stew- it was on the greasy side. The dish had so much pig fat I decided not to eat most of it. It does come with veggies, rice and soup. The veggies were pretty good, there was a variety. The soup was just regular ol' broth nothing in it, Nothing special.Spicy chicken wings-- they were good but defiantly NOT spicy! Fried spicy chicken-- those were pretty good but for some reason they didn't taste like chicken. They tasted more like pork chops. & again they were not spicy. Overall, the food wasn't all that great. Service was below average. The waitress was basically pushing us out the door. She was claiming they were changing shifts so we had to pay now. Like really? Only thing I'm coming here for is the drinks and that's it.
3	I honestly only come here for the boba..Service I don't care for, because well.. They don't give service at all.. If you're dining in, they take your order, bring your food and that's the last you see of them.Their menu has varieties of the smoothies, teas, shaved ice and foods. My favorite items would be Taro Smoothie and their Chicken Wings. The other items and drinks are not too bad.Was never disappointed with food and drinks but the service sucks!
3	i have mango snow iced and iced strawberry w/ pudding. They re both too sweet from my taste. I couldn t drink em all. For appetizer I got spicy chicken wings ,but I couldn t feel or tase any spicy at all.Service must be changed ,but i liked this placevfor hanging out w/friends
3	maybe we came in bad timing, it was about 11 pm, they were buzzing with a lot of customers, so i guess they were out of some of the items we wanted to order. i didn't like how one of the waiter were forcing me to order something i don't want to eat, what happened if i'm allergic to strawberry and i can't eat strawberry, it doesn't matter how great it tasted like he said, if i don't want it, don't force it on me more than 3x.
1	Green milk tea was way overly sweet and tasteless ! Gross. Service was horrendous . Why are these people working here so unhappy ?
4	Since moving to Vegas I have now discovered that Tea Station is indeed the best place for boba in the Las Vegas area. I'm not sure if my taste buds have adapted or if Tea Station has gotten better in the last few years. Either way they are the most authentic I've had in the area and I've been a boba master since the age of 11. Their prices are still a little high and a regular sized pearl milk tea will run close to $4.
3	Updating my review because their service has umphed up an inch. I believe 3 stars are in order for the best boba in Vegas yet still the slowest service & employees that nudge you to leave. In addition, their rule for ALL customers at the table to purchase something is still preposterous (did I just use that word?).
2	This place makes decent drinks and food.  I've been here multiple times when I want some milk tea.  I came by here before driving back to LA for a drink to take for the road.  They had a "monthly promo" special, which was $3.50 for iced milk tea or iced green milk tea with boba (medium size).I told the girl that I wanted just the green milk tea WITHOUT boba and she told me it was going to be more expensive.  I asked her how much and it was $.50 more without boba.  That didn't make any sense to me.  Why in hell would it be more expensive for more tea? I would figure boba would be more expensive than having another 25% more tea in my cup.  I know tea, milk and sugar is NOT that expensive.  The company needs to rethink that out before telling customers that.  It's just plain retarded.I caved in and just got the monthly special but I wasn't too happy about it.  I usually don't care for the boba and just want some milk tea to drink.  I would go back but only if I really craving some decent milk tea in the area.
5	I love this place! I only came for their boba tea! The green tea with matcha powder is my favorite! Topped with a scoop of green tea ice cream! THEY DONT ALLOW YOU TO SWIPE YOUR CARD IF YOUR TOTAL IS UNDER $10.
2	Not bad place for Tea and food.  But the owner/guy behind the bar, needs to lighten up.  I go there 3-5 times a week when I am in town and he always makes you feel as if you are a burden.  With the dozens of other, equally exceptional Tea cafes popping up all around nearby them, they should work on their attitudes.
4	Tea Station has a loooot of pros and cons to it. I'll start with the pros.In my opinion, their drinks are some of the best I've ever had. When I'm feeling iced tea, I get Iced King's tea: not so sweet, not so strongly herbal, there's a nice medium. My boyfriend likes chrysanthemum tea, which is strangely calming. I like their shaved ice, but their new addition which I think is called 'Iced Coconut Combo shaved ice' is absolutely AMAZING. It's shaved ice with boba, taro balls, rice balls(mochi like), grass jelly, azuki beans and sweet potato balls. Me and my friend weren't feeling the sweet potato balls so we switched it out with aloe vera. And oooo0o0o0o0o SWEET JESUS THAT WAS GOOD. Also, their menus have been revamped and everything looks much cleaner! Definitely coming back for that combo shaved ice again ahem. And now the cons. It's expensive as hell. Well not really but you're paying 4-5 dollars for a regular sized drink usually. However I would say it's worth it since out of all the times I've gone there the past three years I've only been disappointed once(don't get the hibiscus tea that drink felt like a good sour punch to the face). Another con would be service. The service is a hit or miss. They can neglect you sometimes. As a server, that's probably one of the worst things you can do. But it doesn't happen every time, it's honestly just a hit or miss. As for the card limit, yes it is pretty high. There could be a number of reasons why it's so high because it's a hassle to process cards, higher running profit, and so forth. It can be a pain sometimes but I don't think it's that bad if you're with a/some friend(s). Just make one person pay and pay them back later with dinner or a family sized bag of chips or something. But yeah, tea station's quality of drinks and shaved ice is good. It's just kinda pricey and the service is a hit or miss.
4	We had the red bean boba and mango snow. Both tasted great although they were on the sweeter side. The boba was delicious, but I might be biased because the boba where I'm from tastes like dirty sponges.
4	best boba i have tasted in town! hate the wait and the service, but love the boba!
5	Not like back at home in Houston, but who am I to even think as pretentious as that?! I love, LOVE the hot Taro boba! Really puts a twist to a drink I didn't think was possible to love anymore than I already did. Shave iced, it's okay, can't complain too much, rather it than nothing! The service is like any other late night Asian place, quick, straight to the point, in-n-out, happy ending short lived.
4	Probably some of the better boba that I've had in my life.  The price is a little high for boba/appetizers, but it's decent being in Las Vegas (I'm willing to splurge like a tourist, I guess.) Their royal milk tea (Earl Grey) is the best I've had in a long while.  Boba texture is close to perfection.  Service is decent. Great place to pick up small bites and drinks to hang out with friends.
5	I've been to so many boba places in Vegas yet this one is my favorite out of all. I've been going here for such a long time to the point where this place wasn't called Tea Station just yet. It's a really social environment with a lot of great choices to select from. It can get really busy especially on Fridays and Saturdays but it's still worth the trip to go here and socialize with your friends. I always bring my friends here whenever they're craving for some boba and ever since their first visit here they always choose this place as their favorite place for boba and drinks. My favorite and some of their most popular drinks there are the milk tea with boba and their matcha milk green tea ice cream! Their milk tea is too delicious to even compare. I don't think any other place in Vegas can make their milk tea as rich and delicious as theirs ESPECIALLY their boba! I go here so often that the workers know me and my order by heart and I have no shame in that haha!
1	I hate this place. WORST SERVICE EVER! I'm not just talking about 1 bad experience. It's EVERYTIME I come here. These people are soooo rude. Bumpin my chair and stepping on my shoes without apologizing...snaring with a bad attitude the whole time. Ughh. Not only are they rude, but why is the tea so expensive?! This place has the most expensive boba in Las Vegas. Please buyers beware..go anywhere else in Chinatown for boba.
3	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... I haven't been to this place in forever because of their service. And that sucks because it used to be a favorite spot.I'm not really into teas, so this review would have to be towards service and what I do see. Yes, they may have good drinks, but their boba is a little bit more on the pricey side. I feel like people go here because it's the "cool" thing to do. It's a perk that they're open late, but they get extremely busy at times. And even when it's not busy, service still sucks. People like to come here and just sit for hours to talk or play games, so sometimes it takes a while if you wanna sit in.The last experience was a horrible one. We came in with a large party of about 10 people. We waited for a table and when we finally got one 30 minutes later, the dude who served us just told us to sit down, put the menus on the table, and walked away. That was the last we saw of him. It took about 45 minutes for us to realize they weren't going to take our order... So we left. Mind you, during that whole time I would look at him to take our order and he kept on saying, hold on with his hand gestures, and would continue on talking to another worker behind the counter. Throughout this time he would also serve other people, and people who sat after us, and still had yet to take our order. We all said forget it and left. And he stared at us as we walked out. Right after he walked to the table and grabbed the menus. Sucks cause we were all super hungry and wanted to try some food AND boba! It's as if he didn't even care to get our business. If I could, I would have given it 2 stars. But I added one more because their strawberry slush is good, from what I used to know. Now, I just pass this place whenever I'm in China town. There are a bunch of other boba places that are just as good with better prices and much better service who care about their customers.My friends and I haven't been there since.
2	Boba places are a dime a dozen but for some reason this one seems to be more popular than others. Maybe it's the location? Or the abundance of seating compared to others? The drinks themselves are  good, but not amazing enough to rave about. However, the service here is horrible. I've probably been here a dozen times to meet with friends (always their choice) and every time it's bad. After they get you your drinks, they pretty much forget you ever existed. It's also poorly staffed as they only have 1 or 2 people serving drinks on a Saturday night. I'd recommend going else where.
3	It was a hot day after edc ! Especially in a heat and exhausting day you want something to drink. I ordered the icy milk slush with black pudding and add strawberry syrup to it ! The drink isn't bad ! It isn't too sweet too ! Honestly I feel they should be more welcoming ! The service isn't bad . They're pretty quick with drinks
3	One of the best boba places I've been to in Las Vegas. I usually get the typical honey dew with boba and pudding! It's fairly busy at night, but many people take their drinks to go. The service is alright here... Many of the workers are very rude.
1	Lately they have some what improved in customer service. Well at least I thought but I think it just depends on who is working. Today was by far the worst experience here so far. We walked in and there maybe 4 or 5 other tables occupied. As is not swamped at  all. After we picked a table 2 or 3 more people walk in and sat down. We waited 15 min for them for approach us with the menu as they always did. NOTHING! They didn't even notice that we were in the place. We got our own menu and still had to get someones attention just to take our order. Then later came to our table and dumped the utensils in the table and walked off. And then when the lady brought our food, she didn't just put the food in the table she also dumped it like we did something wrong to her. Then as the people were coming in they just ended standing around because they didn't know what was going on. A few walked out pissed off already for waiting so long for no reason. Because it was not even that busy.  If I come here again I will make sure that this lady wont be here!
1	Bad service. They don't greet you when you enter. They don't have a system for customers buying or ordering to-go. I mean, when we came there we waited for 15 minutes to be helped. Actually, some people who came in later than we did were served first. Also, when our orders were ready, the guys had no idea who to give the orders to. We had to watch him go from table to table just to find us. We watched and only interrupted when he started to insist giving the order to a customer on another table who repeatedly refused saying it wasn't his order. .. We got worried that our orders might just end up going to someone else that was why we stepped in. Anyway, parking was hard too and it was just a bad experience overall.
5	I visited this location for boba. Compared to other asian boba places, this location is very clean, professional, and organized. I really like the interior of the establishment and the professional business feel. Other boba shops even nearby are very poorly designed and not very professional.
1	With this scorching hot Vegas heat, I was craving something cold and refreshing. I'd usually order an almond milk tea but today I thought I'd try something new. I asked one of the workers about the flavored jelly ice drinks and she suggested a passion fruit jelly ice drink and I was asking her about the lychee jelly toppings... she then spoke to the other workers in Taiwanese and ordered my drink when I was STILL looking at the menu. When I wanted to order another drink (not the one she suggested) she told me that they already made my "order" and maybe I can try another one next time. Seriously? That's horrible customer service! They should wait for the customers to finalize their order. I'm not one to cause a scene so I just shook my head and paid and walked out pissed. The drink they made turned out to be overly sweet and disgusting. It was too sweet I couldn't drink it. They don't even deserve a star. I wish I could give them 0 stars. Looks like I won't ever be coming back here.
2	Located in the Vegas Chinatown plazas, and walking distance from Pho Kim Long and Ranch 99 which was just a plaza over, so super convenient. We walked in and were greeted. I already knew what I wanted so I ordered two drinks and paid. Went to go sit down by my friends and the girl who took my order is screaming across the room asking me to pay. I was like, are you serious??? I JUST paid.... and I had my receipt to prove it. I'm guessing she was just confused.. but still... rude. The green milk tea at this location is definitely no where as good as the one in San Diego and Fremont in California. I was super excited to drink it too.... but it ended up tasting whatever. It was good the next day because I was hungover.. but other than that, I wouldn't come back while in Vegas.
4	Need a refreshing drink? Then this might be one place to go to. It's big enough as a small cafe and is located on the bottom floor of the 2 story complex. (Good if you are weary of walking up a flight of stairs in 100 degree weather.) Also, the AC works and it wasn't muggy inside.I tried the ice coffee milk tea with boba. Blend of coffee and tea wasn't bad if you're looking for a nice caffeine blend between the two. Boba was a nice 75/25 soft chewy to firm ratio where I not worry about it getting stuck in my teeth. I recommend it.
3	I love love love their green tea matcha drink. It's soo yummy and refreshing. The boba is perfectly soft, chewy, and sweet. They have the best green tea drink around. Only negative thing is it's way over priced.  It's about $8 for a drink which comes only in 1 size. That's pretty hefty for a drink. $8 plus tax so almost $9 bucks for A CUP of boba drink which normally cost under $4 elsewhere. Overpriced but yes worth it! :)I also tried their green teas which is too sweet for me and totally not worth $8bucks. I only come here for the matcha drink. Anything else... I'll go to QQboba
4	As far as boba goes in Vegas, I still have a lot of ground to cover and there are still a handful of boba shops I have yet to try. So far, my experience with tea station is the most positive one I've had yet - not on service (service is below average), but in the actual drinks and boba. I would definitely return to try their massive drink selection. They were jammed packed on a Monday at 11pm and there were no open seats, so we hung out at the to-go order counter. Service was definitely non-existent - we were waiting and looking around for a good 5 minutes and none of the employees addressed us or noticed we were there. We finally were able to get one girl's attention by waving her down and she quickly fumbled to take our order. Drinks/Boba: (Better than the average boba shops I've had in Vegas. Plus, the boba doesn't taste like dishwater!! Yay) 1. Ma cha ice cream green milk tea (whew that's a long one) is the bizzness!! Cold, creamy perfection for 100 degree Vegas summer nights. It was my favorite and I slurped it down quick. 2. Thai iced tea with boba - not exactly an authentic thai iced tea, but it had a nice and light thai tea flavor. It was sweet, but not over bearing. The best thing is that you can adjust the sweetness of all of your drinks. You can have them make your drink with more or less sweetness when you place your order.
4	Damn, the greeting is a little better than before. I haven't been here awhile due to the nasty attitude they be giving me as if they don't want my business. Can't deny the fact that their Tapioca is the best in Vegas, but the service can be better. When business does so well, they get too comfortable and don't keep up and start to slack off in some levels. I stopped going here for a year bc of the terrible service. Only came in bc our friends wanted to dropped in. Turned out it's a little better ? Maybe they finally caught on Yelp ? Who knows, just maintain a good service and your sales will increase.
3	Good for hot tea. but usually I go for boba and the boba is only OK. I would have given 4 stars for variety but their lychee jelly sucks. they have the opaque flaccid kind, not the  chewy clear kind.
2	Had been going to this place since Tea Planet days but as of late the quality of food and the service has gone from fair to poor. Gone are the days of prompt service and generous servings of food and sides.
4	The best thing about tea station is that it gives you the option of adjusting the sweetness level of your drink. So the first time I came here I ordered an ordinary ice milk tea with tapioca. I was a bit disappointed that my drink came out so sweet. However, the next time I came here I remembered to ask for half the sweetness and my golly did that make the difference!! Their boba was probably one of the best I've tasted, it has the right amount of chewiness to it and they taste fresh! The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because their drinks are overpriced! I understand that we are paying for quality, but their prices are the highest I've paid for for tapioca!
5	Their drink selection here is amazing, and so is the taste!  I always stop by here and grab a tea when I'm on that side of town.
3	The food and teas and bobas are pretty good, but the service is horrible. Clearly I come for the food and drink. This is the 4th time I have been here in 2 weeks and finally felt compelled to tell fellow yelpers to try to stay clear of Danny's section, unless you want to chase down your server for everything. If the service was better, it would be 5 stars.
3	Flashback to my first visit/impression - came in with friends and barely received a welcome.  My friends and I are chill so who cares.  Don't blame us then if we leave little to no tip! I ordered an iced green tea and for some odd reason it came back tasting like...FISH!!! It wasn't just me as everyone else took a sip and agreed. I just assumed something was added that wasn't supposed to be??? That's a cause of concern. But whatever I didn't ask for another one as they probably would've left me a present in there:PI've visited often for to-go drinks.  I found my favorite drink! Their rose green tea:) their boba is always on point. This keeps me coming back but service always sucks.  I've learned to not take it personal in here. My most recent visit was dine in and I have to give it to them that they may have my favorite desserts (staying away from that regular iced green tea).  We asked one server where it was okay to sit and he said anywhere. A few mins later another server came and wanted to move us because we were only two people but chose a table for six just cause. We were moved TWICE in an EMPTY shop. Okay.....???? Moving on. Took awhile to get our orders in.  Had to flag them down any time we needed something. Don't expect to be waited on. Again, this doesn't phase me as I have no problem paying for my meal...I will just express my disappointment with the proper tip. I work in service and believe strongly in appreciating hard workers. Save your cash on this one!
5	Great selections on chinese desserts and tapioca tea!
1	Can you say crappy service? They stole $59 from my boba card. Freaking ridiculous. Will never eat here ever again. Waitresses speak broken English and ignores my right too.
3	Love this place since it was tea planet.
5	The service was very good. The people that work here are polite and work fast. The white peach oolong is a great drink if you want something sweet!
2	I'll be honest, I enjoy my Thai tea boba whenever I do actually come here to get it,(you can't really go wrong with thai tea boba) but I don't actually enjoy coming here. The service is always rude. I've never really been when I recieved service that I actually thought was nice. Just come here because it's open late or when I'm getting sushi at kaya. I've only had the boba, but the service does not make me want to try anything else. Oh & hate their minimum of $10 to use card. Obviously if you're taking to go, you might just be getting one drink or so.
3	I highly recommend the beef bowl entree and iced almond milk tea if it's your first visit and don't want to get something you're unsure of. The brick toast is also something yummy to try out.
3	Best boba in town! (It gets only 3 stars because I'm comparing it to SF and LA boba.) Not good if you're in a rush, but still worth it! The staff is normally friendly but it's a place where they leave you to do your own thing with the group you're in (which can be really refreshing on certain occasions). You really have to flag down the servers if you need their attention. The sad thing is that they seem to periodically raise their price with no sort of stamp card rewards system in place. Their boba is cooked very well, but soon the price will drive me away completely.Try their matcha green milk tea (it's got a yummy scoop of green tea ice cream!), boba milk tea (get it hot during the winter), mango shaved ice (it's seasonal), and takoyaki.
4	Went here for a late night milk tea treat and wasn't disappointed! Came out quick and was decently good. Will be returning.
3	I've been to this place a few times within the past few years. Each visit has been the same, a-okay. The only reason I come here is because it's open later than other boba places. The service is pretty bad, but the boba is nice and chewy. It still doesn't compare to the taste of kung fu tea's boba though. I would only go back if friends want to go for a late boba run.
1	Mhmm, I can see why this place has as many stars as it does... First walked in this place and it looks super nice, can't deny that... But I got no greetings or anything. The people who worked there just kinda stared at me and noticed my existence but didn't approach me or anything. There was about 2 workers, I wanna say. One of them was helping other customers and the other one was kinda wandering off or something. Anyhow, I just stood there and then kinda looked through the menu, but I felt rude doing that so I stopped and just waited until they greeted me. After the worker was done with the customers, she came to me and asked if I was ready to order and I said that I wasn't and I was actually just going to buy a drink or something of that sort. She put a menu in front of me and just said, "ok let me know when you're ready."Because the customer service was already ehh, I already didn't wanna order something, but I decided to anyways. Seconds later, she came back and I told her my order which was Thai tea with boba and while she put in my order, she rudely asked what size I wanted and I didn't hear her, so she repeated herself and I was like, "I guess a medium?" I didn't know how big or small their drinks are... Gosh, then I went to pay and she was like, "you're paying in cash right?" And I said, "no, I only have debit. Sorry. I don't have cash on me." And omg, she rudely pointed to a piece of paper somewhere and said, "look, we can only do debit $10 and over." I was just, I didn't know what to do, so I said that it was fine, I don't have to buy it, it's ok. Then she said, "it's $5 and (something) cents," grabbed my card, and said to me in such a rudely manner, "I will only do this for you once, but not again, not next time." Pleeease! There will be no next time. Oh gosh and then literally her and her coworker started speaking another language, and I can clearly tell they were talking about me... -_- They were completely looking at me and just talking out loud obnoxiously. Anyhow, took my card back, turned around, and all of a sudden, my drink was handed to me... Kinda like, they were in a rush to just get me out of their store. But nooo, I sat down for a bit and then asked if they had an outlet plug where I can charge my phone because my phone was dying... And they said I had to go outside and use a plug... Really? A restaurant/tea place? And I have to go outside to plug my phone in? Okaaay. Never coming back here. Ruuude.
3	Haven't encountered the bad service issues that others complain about, but they do lose a star for their their $10 card minimum- and this whole damn plaza is like that.The coconut milk tea and coffee milk tea are both good here, and the boba is great: soft, good chewiness, good quantity. Millions of tea-flavored foods are here as well, the tea-flavored eggs and eel sound amazing but so far I haven't been brave enough to try them.Really ticked off about the $10 minimum- if food trucks can use Square without having a minimum, a brick and mortar building has no excuse. I drive by frequently and opt to go elsewhere because I rarely carry cash and won't order that much if I'm solo.
1	Came in to have a Boba drink and something to eat with my daughter, no sign saying "please wait to be seated", sat at the nearest table and a server asked us to move to the next table rudely,  place was not busy and plenty of tables was open and available.  If this business wants to start signing seats to there customer they should greet there customers and have a sign stating "please wait to be seated"!!!! Was a favorite hang out, didn't mind that the customer service was low and the greeting was terrible, just came for the Boba drink. Now this business lost a customer. Tea Station you are definitely not all that! Taking my business elsewhere!
3	I absolutely love Tea staion. There tea is wonderful. The only thing they Need to work on is their customer service.  Every time I go I am waiting 15+ minutes to order. And another 15+min waiting for my check. I went the other day and had to wave my hand in the air in order to get a waitresses attention. When we got our check I put my card on the check immediately.  She left and didn't come back. After 20 min of waiting I decided to just walk up there. But overall they do have the best tea.
4	So far, I've been to Tea Station a handful of times and every time, my experience has been solid. They are also conveniently open late, which is great when my go-to boba shop (Kung Fu Tea) is closed. I would definitely return to Tea Station to try their massive drink selection. Drinks/Boba: (average / above average compared to the majority of boba shops I've tried in Vegas. The boba is always cooked properly, plus, the boba doesn't taste like dishwater!! Yay) 1. Ma cha ice cream green milk tea (whew that's a long one) is the bizzness!! Cold, creamy perfection for 100 degree Vegas summer nights. It was my favorite and I slurped it down quick. Flavor rating: 5/52. Thai iced tea with boba - not exactly an authentic thai iced tea, but it had a nice and light thai tea flavor. It was sweet, but not over bearing. Flavor rating: 3/53. Coconut Milk Tea with boba - I really enjoyed the refreshing and light coconut flavor, plus It wasn't overly sweet. It's one of my favorite dessert drinks after dinner because it's not too heavy or filling. Flavor rating: 5/54. Iced Honey Green Tea - the tea flavor wasn't too strong or bold like I typically prefer, but the overall flavor was refreshing and enjoyable. They were also light handed with the honey, so it was not too sweet. I would probably ask them to add more honey next time and adjust it to my taste. Flavor rating: 3/5The best thing is that you can adjust the sweetness of all of your drinks. You can have them make your drink with more or less sweetness when you place your order.
3	I was first introduced to Tea Station during my visit to LA last year. The ginseng tea definitely helped to reduce the soreness of my throat at that time. The good experience in LA made me decided to stop by Tea Station in Vegas.Our two visits to Vegas Tea Station were pleasant. In particular, we loved the drinks. Although my Longan tea might be slightly too sweet, it was refreshing. My friend loved her melon smoothie. My friend and I had contradictory views about the food. My friend loved the proportion between the octopus and the dough in takoyaki (octopus balls). In contrast, I rated my tea flavored fried tofu slightly above average. The tofu was hot, but it did not have a crispy layer.The star of Tea Station is the drinks. The food was average, but it was relatively authentic, cheap and arrives quickly. If you want a quick bite, you should definitely stop by Tea Station.
1	It's a nice spot. Service is unprofessional but  acceptable. However, the drinks are sketchy  today. Both me and my husband got major headaches right after drinking their teas with boba. I am still drowsy after couple hours!!!! Wtf is in our drinks?!! I'm not going again! This is very scary.
1	I used to eat here and drink teas, but this morning there is one server (staff) named Yi..was very mean, rude, unprofessional.  Very bad service. ..I was.asking about bobba tea menus...apparently I didnt quite hear what she says because of the loud music in the store, that she has to repeat her response, then she just rolled her eyes and says " you know what im saying" as if like im stupid. Then she talks to one of the staff in taiwanese and looking at me...like  as if I dont understand....I would not recommend this anymore to my friends and family..Rude server...pls be aware of that girl named Yi...bad customer service...
2	I usually come here a lot and never complain about anything. When I came here this time I  ordered their icy strawberry jelly drink with squid balls and wings. When I got my drink and took one sip....OMG I seriously thought I drank pureStrawberry syrup with crushed ice. It was so sweet I had to ask for water and pour half it in there to dilute it. I didn't bother complaining because I fixed it with water. Other than that the wings were slightly over cooked and I loved the squid balls.
2	I have been here a couple of times because it's convenient to the surrounding restaurants in the same complex that do not have boba. Sadly every time I have received next to no service. Once we even waited 45 mins to pay for our bill.The drinks themselves are decent but a little too sweet. The milk teas and teas (in which I usually get) isn't too bad. They do have a really large menu with tons of variety on both drinks and appetizers.If you do plan to visit this establishment, expect to see your waitress when you take your order, when they give you your drinks, and maybe when they come to pick up the $$ for your bill. More than once I had to literally walk up to the register to pay for our tab since they were taking really long.
2	It was around 11PM on a Saturday night in Vegas and I couldn't go out clubbing since I was with my mom, so my friend that lives in Vegas and I decided to just grab some boba. However, the majority of the boba places in Vegas close around 9 and Tea Station was the only place that was opened, so we flocked there.THE DETAILS: Located around China Town I believe. It was really easy to find and so was parking. The shop was pretty narrow, but there was quite a lot of seating area. The decor was standard, nothing special stood out to me. There was a wall with lots of tea displayed that caught my attention though. It's open later than the rest of the other boba places, so that's a plus. The workers are friendly. The prices for the drinks are overpriced to me. $10 for two drinks. THE DRINK: I didn't want to drink anything heavy like milk tea, so I ordered something on the lighter side.--Iced Chrysanthemum tea: Okay, so this might be my fault because I asked for Chrysanthemum tea without sweetener, so it was very, very bitter. I'm used to the bitter taste of tea and I actually enjoy it, but this tea was so bad. I've had unsweetened chrysanthemum tea before and it did not taste like what I received from here. I still drank it because it was refreshing nonetheless, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.THE END? I took a sip of my friend's regular milk tea and I thought it was alright; I probably wouldn't return though. Unless of course, I'm with my mom, it's 11 at night, and I'm not at the club.
4	I love the matcha green tea with boba! It's a giant milk green tea with a scoop of green tea ice cream on top and boba in the bottom. The taro milk tea is just as good. My friend always gets a green apple black tea, not on the menu anymore but they still have it! The snow ice is legit and the food is pretty decent. The thai tea isn't very strong. But it's ok.
2	Call me spoiled but I'm used to the land of boba and milk tea, Los Angeles. I guess that makes me a boba snob? Is that even a thing? I guess it can be. I'm still trying to find a good place for boba, teas and snacks in Vegas and my quest has come up with nothing so far. I tried Tea Station out one afternoon after having lunch with some friends in Chinatown. I've been to the ones in SoCal before and expected it to be pretty much the same thing. I guess it was okay. I had a green milk tea with grass jelly regular size and it came out to about $5.. It was a little pricey and the grass jelly was just alright.However, this place has a HUGE menu and selection of teas, milk teas, smoothies, etc and a food menu as well! I think if I were to come back, I want to try their popcorn chicken (Chinese popcorn chicken, mind you) which I have been craving!Tea Station is in the same plaza as Ichiza and parking can be a toughie sometimes since there are a very limited number of spots in the plaza so may the parking deities be with you on your quest as well!
4	I was first introduced to Tea Station last night. My best friends and I were out in town having dinner and decided to come in for desert. It was my first time in this place and I was pretty stoked to see their boba selection. They were pretty busy last night but we got seated right away and our waitress was very helpful and cordial. I ordered the brick bread and the hot almond milk tea and I gotta say it was DELICIOUS... Our orders didn't take long to come out and everything was just right and tasty...My only gripe is the prices on the drinks we payed $60 for 4 people... Yikes! The service was good, the drinks were great! I'll definitely be back again (:
4	This place is tried and true. They don't "run out of boba," which is so very devastating once you've committed to the idea. They have flavors for every preference. I don't like slushy drinks. I rarely get iced milk teas. I come here for two, consistently good things: hot rose milk tea and their "hot healthy drink/dessert" taro soup with taro balls and red bean. Fun fact: I was feel adventurous and tried Lavender. That may be someone's preference, but I felt like I was drinking soothing-nighttime-lotion. Lavender has no other association for me.
2	How terrible is this place? Their service is terrible. Their pricing is okay since they're in China town.The fact that they monopolize on the late night "coffee cafe" market is their main selling point. I've never encountered a pleasant employee.It feels like they have no expectations for their staff to provide any sort of service.Their Thai tea is okay. I wouldn't believe it if someone told me it was brewed in house.I've been here about 5 times and never by my own free will.  The one thing I'll give them is their takoyaki is okay.Their iced green teas are good.
2	My teen kids bug me to stopped for BOBA tea all my way to go to work.They were hungry but i plan to cook for them.They said mommy please just boba tea.Then I said OK.But once they saw the menu that have attractive colorful all pictures of nice looking food again they said they wanted to try.End up with 3 cups boba teas and 3 entrees.And they did not touch the food after first bite.I tried to make them eat but they refuse said the food have to taste.And I sipped my honeydew smoothie with boba.What a fool i was.When i have fresh cut Honey dew at my fringe why did I spent $60 for artificial Honey dew power with iced.People just learn and live.Give two star for fast service and very nice chewy boba.
3	It was okay to me. But I would love to come here to try it again. Got green tea bubble and this strawberry thing with loke grass jello, pudding.
3	Bull shit customer service. Although I still go 3 times a month. Bull shit. Customer service. Oh and did u know: you cant bring pastries or any outside food into this place? Even though you order like five things. Lmfao. I need to find a new place. -.-
3	I've visited Tea Station a hand full of times-- but just enough to rate it a solid 3 stars. On my last visits customer service was always a more in the negative side, not too friendly, they were completely confused as to why I would want a spoon when my cup was still filled with leftover toppings from my drink. I did enjoy the rose milk tea, it had a strong floral scent. The other drinks that I had included the jasmine milk tea and an Oreo one also, both were too sweet for my liking. In the end the only reason I'd go back is because they're open later than other teashops, not for their drinks or service.
2	I was not very happy with the service or the milk tea I purchased this morning...I don't think I will be returning here again!!!
4	Not much to say about customer service.  They get my order quite fast. They have never been rude to me. Their boba quality is consistent and good. I also like their sweet butter toast.
5	I come here all the time to get my favorite ice cold rose flavored green tea. It tastes very sweet and perfumey but I love it since it's so unique. It does relax me more then give me a kick like some other teas. They have so many flavors of delicious tea combinations to choose from and boba as well. There food is reasonably priced, and good for lunch. They are open fairly late which is nice if you want to stop buy for something light and tasty. Staff is very friendly. Nice atmosphere. There taro iced smoothies are really good too. They also have blooming tea as well.
1	Lame ass expensive place. Flavors are too sweet nd are so artificial. Place is crowded nd small nd loud inside
1	They made me pay before the food came it and added tip they did not earn forgot to out my order in I would NEVER come back. This is Vegas you give great service and earn your tip and don't mess up without fixing it.
4	I went on a date on 12/20/14 after 8pm and the service was so-so, but the tea was amazing. She got Lavender Milk tea with no boba and the garlic wings (she loved them, I did not try them), and I got Mixed Fruit tea. I really wish the service had been just a little more attentive. They pretty much leave you alone unless you manage to flag them down, but we were there for over 5 hours and they didn't say anything about it. Both teas were really great, the Mixed fruit tea was on the sweet side, so you'll definitely want some water or savory food to break it up, but it was addicting. The lavender tea was subtle and lightly sweetened and a nice counter to the mixed fruit. I'm going back tonight with my best friend and I look forward to trying their food.
3	Being a boba fanatic, when I saw tea station, I got excited because the tea station in both Fremont and San Diego are both very good. However, when I ordered royal milk tea here, it tasted very fake. On the menu it said earl grey tea but tasted remotely similar. Also they never asked me what level of sweetness I wanted which I recall being a pretty big point to this chain. The boba balls are good though! I didn't like the drink it didn't give me that satisfying boba feeling. My friends got the rose milk tea and regular milk tea and none of them tasted that great either. I did appreciate they had nice seating and were open during Xmas Eve. Didn't get to try the food because I was about to eat dinner but their menu was fancy and food looked tantalizing. Oh also I want to comment on the music. I do appreciate good old jay Chou classics. Whoever chose the music must really be a jay fan bcuz it was nonstop jay Chou for the 30 mins we were there. No complaints though!
3	Drinks are some of the better ones in the area. Prices are higher. Service and staff are lousy. 3 stars.
4	Tea is pretty good here. Price is slightly higher than other Boba tea spots but very good none the less.  We had the rose milk tea, mango green tea, and peach black tea. No complaints and exactly what we expected. Also seem to have interesting choices of food and snacks to choose from.
1	We one time called around 12am if they were still open and said they were "out of everything." I did not believe it so we still went anyways after checking their closing time is 1am. They took our order still and sat to chat for a bit. We were told to leave 30 min before closing as we were the last customers there. This place has horrible customer service. The workers talk ill towards the customers who they believe dont understand their language too
5	Food: 5/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 5/5Decor & Style: 5/5For a chain, this place is my favorite in terms of the taste of Taro Milk Tea (Iced). Taro milk tea is one of my favorite drinks and having tried probably over 20 different tea places, I would say this place is my fav. The menu selection is nice as well since they have tons of appetizers and fried dishes in which makes this place a great place to chill every weekend with friends. Decor is slightly small but  has good ambience. Service is slightly slow during busy hours. Highly recommend the Taro Milk Tea!
3	Rose milk tea? YESSSSSS.Let's be real, this place can be super annoying. The parking is atrocious (usually going next door to the main Chinatown plaza and walking over is the thing to do if you're not going right when they open) and the credit card minimum obnoxious ($10), but on top of that, the service is also nonexistent (will someone please come and take my money?). However, if you know what you're in for, the drinks and snacks are great.
1	Disappointed! Worst customer service ever. Server by the name of (Yi) was rude as taking our order and walked away from us. Once the food was brought to the table it had hair in the chicken wings. Sure won't return
4	i now realize why they charge so much for their drinks. the boba is consistently soft and perfect and the drink flavors are mastered to be consistent everytime you come here..ive been coming here for years but the only thing that really holds me back from coming here a few times a week is their price. i just cant see myself spending $15 for two people for 2 drinks everytime
4	The only downside about this place is that the servers are slow. Tonight we just picked our own table & it took them 15 minutes to get to us just to say hi.... Other than that the place is great! Love that they close late!
2	Food is awesome!!!!...service two thumbs down! Sat ourselves after about 10 minutes got up to look for a server. Then had to ask for our check. They can not communicate with the customers. They are speaking amongst each other as they are in their own world. No personality!!
4	Very good Boba tea and decent food. Came here to dine in last night really enjoyed our taro boba slush. Only downfall is how long the servers take to make an order and to even greet you. Other then that it was a pleasant experience
4	My favorite boba place in Vegas. If you get some drinks to go, they come out pretty fast. The quality of their drinks is fantastic you can tell that they make their boba every morning. I love getting their milk teas because the tea is really good quality and their boba is perfect. Their other drink toppings aren't that great though. If you're used to pudding in your drink from places in CA, their pudding will let you down.If you sit in, the service is slow and the waiters are don't really pay attention to you. If you're not in a rush then it's not too big of a deal. Bottomline is that this is still the best place to get boba in this city.
