5	I like Big Wong and I cannot lie. This strangely named restaurant just opened today. If you happen to catch this review soon enough, you can drop in and get a free entree with the purchase of a $1 soda or bottled water. It's for dine-in only and is valid through May 18.I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice. This dish normally costs $4.95 but was free with my $1 can of ginger ale. So how was it? It was actually very good. For $4.95, it's a great deal. For free, it's a steal!Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.I'm inclined to give this place four stars based on the one dish I've tried so far, and the extremely fast and friendly service. Add in the fact that everything is under $5 - oh and that's tax included - and I'm glad to bump that up to a fiver.
4	Got the #2 (Hoi Nam Chicken over Seasoned Rice) for lunch today and when the plate came I was pleased with the looks of a steamed chicken cooked all the way through - no bloody marrow. It came with two small dishes of seasoned soy sauce and a special chili sauce which both worked perfectly with the chicken/rice. You must use the sauces to get the most out of this dish! Overall this dish reminded me of my mom's steamed game hen - one of my favorites. Warning: Big Wong's version is served cold, and the menu doesn't say so. Impressive build-out of the restaurant space, Big Wong! Clean, bright and nice stone and tile work, definitely not what I expected from the outside as the storefront windows are limo-tinted and you can't see in at all. Bathrooms are nicely tiled from floor-to-ceiling. Exhibition kitchen is a nice surprise. Big Wong seems to be in it for the long haul. Going back tomorrow (last-minute UYE anyone?) for another dish and a possible upgrade to 5-stars if things go well... to be continued
3	Free meal with the purchase of a $1 drink through May 18. What's not to love? The service was friendly and fast. I tried the curry chicken with roti pancakes and my fella got the boneless fried chicken with udon. We shared the two dishes and for a grand total of $2, how can you go wrong? The curry was a little subtle for my taste, wish it had a bit more kick. I'm a big fan of udon and the chicken was moist and tasty. I enjoyed it, despite my aversion to fried chicken usually.I definitely recommend you try to get there before Thursday. That deal's too good to pass up. The regular menu items are very reasonably priced so even if you don't get in on the free offer, $5 for a meal? Heck yes!
1	Where should I begin?? After being seated and waiting 10 minutes, our waitress bypassed our table twice to take orders from people that were seated after us. Not sure if us being the only black couple had anything to do with it. I ordered the curry chicken with roti pancakes and there must have been a chicken shortage because I received a bowl of curry potatoes with a few chicken scraps.. Needless to say, I won't be back.. I'm only out $1.00, so that's a plus..
3	It is probably not fair to write a review during the grand opening/dollar days extravaganza, but this is a "good" 3 stars.  Waited in a short line (I was hanging out of the door) at 1 PM, and I see the backs of the guys at the front of the line, and it is Anthony T. and Tien N. no less!  I yelled out and they had me join them.  After being seated, we got our orders in pretty fast and my food was cold (I expected that after reading Bobby Y.'s review) so I got to eat first!  I ordered #1 Hainan chicken white meat - it came with cucumbers, the rice cooked in chicken broth, and 2 dipping sauces.  The spicy sauce was killer - after I finished the chicken and the cucumber I poured the sauce on the rice and ate it last.  It was pretty good.  The only time I had similar food was at a food cart in Portland.Tien had the curry chix with roti and Anthony had the thin ribeye with rice/potatoes.  Definitely worth the buck.  Tien graciously treated me with his stack of quarters.  I probably would not rush back but it will be cheap even once it goes up to $4.95 per dish, and the rice and spicy sauce *are* pretty tasty.
4	With a name like Big Wong, there are bound to be some jokes and uncomfortable looking older Chinese women glaring at their white husbands. That is what I encountered as I was waiting for my food. The lack of music or any other white noise allowed me to eavesdrop on my surrounding tables. I know it is not the most polite, but us Chinese people talk loud enough for everyone to be a part of the festivities anyways.I wished I had brought a book because I felt uncomfortable sitting alone while waiting for my fried chicken and rice to come. Normally I have no problems eating alone, but there was nothing to distract me.I had noticed that the food comes out at random, it does not matter if your party ordered everything at the same time, because you will get it in whatever order the chefs tray them up. If you have a problem with this then it would be best to avoid this restaurant because you will be furious. Some people finished their food before the rest of their party even got their meal. I saw four tables that came in after me get their food and finish before mine came out. For me, it is not a big deal because my chicken was being fried fresh. The waitress had also apologized a couple of times, but I reassured her I didn't mind. When I got it, the skin and parts of the meat were crispy, while the inside was juicy and tender. This was perfect. The protein was served with rice, a fermented chopped veggie (cabbage), a chilled boiled tea egg, and a dipping sauce that had ground meat in it. Mixing the rice with all the other ingredients made for a delicious side. I would come back here again and pay the regular price for a meal. Nothing cost over five dollars and is great if you just want something simple. Just remember to bring something to keep you preoccupied if dining alone.
3	Hey, if you're going to have a Wong, make it a big one, right? The incentive to quality control this new eatery was that if you paid a dollar for your beverage (and mind you if you're reading this review 5/17/11-5/18/11 it's still going on), your entree was FREE! No, that's not a typo, it's true. FREE. The three amigos ate for $3 dollars (plus tip) last night. Newly remodeled with fresh yellow paint and ZERO items on the wall (perhaps not to distract from the food?), Big Wongs appeared to be clean and hoppin. Seated at the very last table, conveniently located next to the hallway leading to the restrooms we placed our beverage order. Our canned soda's arrived in a timely fashion, unlike our food. The number list of menu items was pretty small, but based on observation, I believe their is an "off the menu" option for things such as bok choy (which we found no where on the list). We chose our "numbers" and placed our order then commenced witty conversations amongst ourselves. .............OK, so there's not enough time, or A.D.D. medication for me to input enough dots to represent the length of time we waited for our meals, but it was a while (*clears throat*, 40 minutes). We received our food, one dish at a time and about 5 to 15 minutes in between each other, but I would say despite the wait, the food was actually quite tasty! I will give them a small exception that it was in fact their opening night and all, but common..Your menu is tiny, your items are numbered and the Restaurant seats about 10 tables MAX. Perhaps I'm being harsh but I don't see what the struggle to get food out in a timely fashion was all about..just sayin. OK, OK, enough of that. The food itself was very delicious and everything on the featured menu is UNDER $5!!! Yes folks, that's right, UNDER $5.00!! Would I eat there again? Sure. Would I go out of my way to get there, bring anyone there, or recommend it? Prolly not.
5	I like Big Wong and I can not lie, you other brother's cannot lie.Ok all song parodies aside, I have to admit I am a fan of Big Wong.The opening special was enough to get me in the door...are you kidding me $1 for a meal, I'm in! And the food was good enough to get me to come back 3 times in 2 days. And as long as they keep serving it up I will be going back.The $1 special is insane, however their normal priced menu is still insanely cheap, there isn't anything over $5 including tax!I have had the Pork Chops twice and the Ribeye once. The Ribeye was served with rice and some cucumber slices, it was pretty good, a little small but still a solid offering. The Pork Chop is my favorite thing on the menu, both times I've got it with the Udon Noodles and have enjoyed every bite.There have been some issues with the service, I have to say my service was great, and let's be honest they've been slammed so I give them a some forgiveness. The Kitchen is open so you can see them prep the food, I was really impressed how quickly my order came out all 3 times, those guys back there aren't messing around.I will say the walls could use some pictures or something (they are bare), but other than that I really like the place, I can see myself picking up some grub there on more than one occasion and as Paolo said if they were open later, I would be eating here all the time, for now I'll just settle for twice a day.
4	Went there for the grand opening special. Free meal with purchase of a $1 drink. I thought it was going to be a little sampler it something but it ended up pretty good. Ordered the special fried chicken with rice 5a. The chicken was crispy and juicy, not greasy. Loved the dipping sauce that came with it. They have choice of rice or noodles for each meal. The noodles came with soup in a big bowl. They just opened so everything is clean. Service was pretty fast considering there was a bunch of meal there. I placed my order went to wash my hand in the restroom, got back all our plates were there. they did have a long line out side but its because there wasn't a waiting area inside wait, just put ur name on the list and waited 15 mins checked the other stores around so it was quick. I think today is the last day for their special so ill probably go there and try something else. Meals regular are about $4.95.
3	Today was the last day of the grand opening special so I dragged a few of my coworkers to join me.  We arrived about 3:30pm, the place was packed but the wait wasn't very long, only 10 mins for a party of 5.  Seems like they turn the tables over pretty quickly for a little place.They only have 14 items on the menu so we had already decided what we were going to order before we sat down.  I got the Hoi Nam Chicken over seasoned rice, my friends got deep fried pork chop over rice, fried pork chop with udon noodle soup and curry chicken over rice.My Hoi Nam chicken was moist, the dipping sauce was delish but the seasoned rice was the best!We all tried each others dishes- the curry chicken had great flavor, it was more Japanese style (which I like) but was a tad greasy.The fried pork chops were also good, but better when you dip in this sauce they give that has a beef stock taste to it.We also ordered some vegetables in oyster sauce that was okay, nothing special since it was just steamed/boiled Chinese broccoli with sauce.Overall, it was a success cause our meal came out to $7.95 for 5 entrees and 4 drinks with the special.  I would defiantly come back since the regular prices are still not bad at all- $4.95 including tax.
4	If I solely based ratings on value, Big Wong would get 4.5-5 stars but everything here is average to above average at best. The Hainanese chicken sauce is good but the chicken tastes like it was only boiled in water. The curry chicken wasn't bad, but it could really use more kick. The fried pork chop and fried chicken were really flavorful. All in all, for 5 bucks an entree you can't complain. If I were in school, I'd prob be here all the time. It's really decent fast Chinese food. Nothing spectacular but cheap food.------------------------------EDIT---------------------------------------------------------I came back and had the Shrimp Soup with Shirmp Wonton.  The soup was really flavorful, the noodles had great texture, and I am definitely a fan of their shrimp wontons.I was a little harsh on my first review but I should cut some slack since I went during their Grand Opening special.Value-wise, everything is under 5 bucks with tax so it's a hell of a value.  I'll be back espeically for their fried chicken and fried pork chop.
3	Went back last night on a last-minute whim with a couple of other Yelpers and ordered the Vegetables w/Oyster Sauce (without Oyster Sauce) and the Pork Chop over Rice. Rice was plain, and the Vegetables were a steamed (and plain) Chinese broccoli. The sad-looking Pork dish came out thinly cut and cooked 'til dry with a side dish of glutenous pork sauce - sounds good, huh? Ha ha ha. Hard to complain about a $1 promotional meal, but let's just say I am glad $1 included a cold, refreshing bottle of spring water. It was the first time in my life that I would be caught pouring soy sauce into my rice pile to desperately add flavor. Ah, the shame. I wish I had ordered the #2 again (Hoi Nam Chicken)...It was funny to hear the excited folks texting and calling their friends to come join them for the 'Chinese meal deal of the year' and saying (without having seen the menu) that they can't wait to order some won-ton soup and orange chicken. They were in for a Hoi Nam surprise.Truth is, it's just fun to say "Let's go to Big Wong" so the reality is that I am probably going to end up trying everything on their menu by the end of the summer. 20 items x $5 = $100 = so if they can keep their customers' curiosity going they might do really well. I'm temped to do a drive-by tonight to see if the buzz from the 3-day dollar sale leaks over into real sales.Overall my impression of Big Wong so far is this: if IKEA opened a small Taiwanese/Chinese restaurant in the Raku/Monta strip mall it would be a lot like this one. Small menu and cheap prices and the food looks like food, but when it comes down to taste and execution, you may wonder if the Swedish Chef is doin' the cooking.
4	I went to Big Wong Restaurant for a Meetup (Sushi & More) gathering, met some diverse and interesting folks and we for the most part enjoyed the meal we had during their opening $1 promotion.My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more "seasoned".I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the "greasy" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.------Version 1.0.1 Update------Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant.5-29-2011------Version 1.0.1 Update------Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.------Version 1.0.2 Update------Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self. 12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P)------Version 1.0.2 Update------Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant.
2	This simple, no fuss restaurant has a very limited selection of entrees to select from.  You would think that since the selection is so limited, that they would do a good job with the food.  Unfortunately, that is not the case here.  We ordered wonton soup, curry chicken rice and deep fried chicken udon soup.  All the dishes were on the bland side.  No rave reviews here.  The only thing that it has going for it is the price.  The menu items are all about $5.00, but the dishes are not that big.  It's okay for lunch, but the portions are not big enough for supper.  The service was okay, it took a little while for the waitress to come take our order, but can't complain since she was the only one waiting on tables and taking care of the cash register.
3	Like most others who have written a review, I came here for their fabulous grand opening specials. Nothing really beats a meal and drink for one dollar. Would I go back to this place with their normal prices? Probably. Would I come back here often? Probably not. On my first visit I indulged and ordered two items. First off was the fried pork chop. It was disappointing to say the least. It was kind of bland and chewy. The sauce that accompanied it was pretty tasty though.The highlight of the dish was the perfecly cooked boiled egg that came with it, which provided for a nice surprise. The second item ordered was their wonton soup. This was actually quite good. The wontons were cooked well and the broth was good. It had nice flavor without being too salty. The second time going, I ordered their hainan chicken [which is served cold by the way, as it helps keep the chicken tender]. The chicken was mediocre. But how nice can cold steamed chicken really get? The rice that accompanies it is supposed to be 'seasoned.' I didn't taste much of a difference between that and their regular white rice though. I guess the highlight of the dish were the two sauces that come with. Mix em together, and you have a killer sauce which makes up for the rest of the dish. I'd probably order this dish again, just to get the sauce. All in all, the service is pretty good. I was surprised that everyone was being so friendly, considering the hectic days they must have had opening the restaurant. And the quickness of the food coming out was great as well. Their prices are pretty decent as well. There's nothing for more than five dollars, and all prices are tax included. So, if you want a cheap Chinese meal, definitely come here. And just a side note - if you go hungry, I'd avoid ordering the pork chop. The serving size is a lot smaller compared to the chicken. When I ordered the pork & wonton soup, I easily ate both [& I hate to admit it, because it makes me seem like a fatty, but I could've eaten more. =p]. However, the day I went and only ordered the chicken, I was completely content.
5	Big Wong is BIG on value. Though we missed the "Dollar Dining," we are very happy to have discovered this place. Luckily, my parents saved the flyer and after seeing the prices on their menu, we asked, "why not?" We went there this past Sunday evening and met the owners Wai (or was it Wayne?) and Connie and their "regulars" Judd and Lynn. Luck would have it, we are all avid cruisers. Woo Hoo...one can never have too few cruising buddies! Back to why we are here: the food. Big Wong's menu is limited to one page and some posted specials on the wall. After discussing the menu with Wai and Connie, their philosophy is to keep the menu simple and ensure their food is always consistent and at a reasonable price. Mission accomplished! I had the Hainan Chicken and my wife had the Curry Chicken. The flavoring of the Hainan style chicken was delicate and tender. You dip the chicken into the accompanying chili sauce or soy/sesame oil sauce. The included seasoned rice was fluffy and also delicately seasoned. The chicken curry was wonderful and included potatoes, however, I like a little more "kick" in my curry. Spiciness is such a subjective matter and I understand you cannot please everyone. Some people may just complain that it is too spicy. You can't subtract spiciness, but you can always add. Connie also brought a sample of their beef stew and let me tell you, the beef was so tender and delicious! Both of our portions are satisfying and don't let the price fool you. You definitely get your money's worth here! Looking forward to becoming regulars at Big Wong and try out their ramen and wontons.Update 6/5/11-Since writing this review, we have been back two more times and today with my parents. I have had the Beef Ramen, Ribeye over Pasta, and my wife had the Shrimp Wontons twice. Big Wong's Beef Ramen is exquisite. They spend a lot of time preparing the bite-size chunks of beef and tendons by trimming out the fat and un-chewable membrane that you find in Chinese style beef stew. Every piece is satisfyingly tender. I asked Wai how is the broth prepared and he told me directly from the stew. Delicious and hearty. No MSG after taste here.The wontons (immersed in a flavorful broth) are loaded with shrimp and no pork filler used here. The ribeye is also very tender and juicy (cooked medium) and comes with a pepper style gravy that you pour yourself and a sliced herbed potato.6/17/11-Went to our first UYE here at Big Wongs. It was great to meet other Yelpers.6/19/11-Wai has been telling me about his Dungeness Crab over rice noodles (horfun) special and I had to give it a try so we came back today. The fresh crab is steamed with ginger and served over the rice noodles with it's natural sweet crab juice. Simply delicious.
4	We couldn't resist Big Wong's Grand Opening special - Purchase $1 beverage and get your meal free!We were concerned with how packed this place would be during their opening week, but we easily got a table with no wait.  Lucky us...the news was just spreading!What surprised us most was the pleasant and welcoming reception we received when we walked in.  Yes, it may have had to do with the non-Asian face smiling at us as we walked in, but it definitely gave us a different impression of how our meal was going to be.Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.  We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that! Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!3.5 stars.
5	So there is no dude named Big Wong cookin in the back...But they shoulda named it Big Right instead of Big Wrong, cuz they got the food right!I had the beef ramen special;Tender morsels of beef, tendon also available, broth very tasty, they have green onions as a condiment (cool) cuz I luv me some onyawns....And for 5.95, it can't be beat!  Food came out in like 3 minutes...If you're on the go for lunch, this is way better than any burger or subway!This is an above average rice plate shop, so you have to have a good Chinese palate cuz there ain't any eggrolls here or sweet n sour pork.... Real deal stuff that some peeps may have never seen before... I mean nothing off the wall like intestines or pigs feet or  wax on the nipples, oooops thats a different movie...Next on the menu is the Hoi Nam chickyy:Served 3 ways, white, dark or dark w bone in, now that's a Chinese thang....To be continued.... Da Wonger
4	I had to try this place not just because of it's absolutely hilarious name but because I'd heard it was super cheap eats.  Am a cheap eater?  No.  But was hoping this was that rare place that served good food at super low prices.  Basically, a place where they realizes their prices are too low but are too afraid to alienate their new customers.Verdict?  Kind of.Had the pork chop over rice and beef ramen.1) Pork chop over rice - I'm told you have to ask for it crispy to get it...crispy.  Not sure why they do that.  I did not know this when ordering so was disappointed at the lack of...crispiness.  It was also underseasoned.  Definitely added a lot of salt to this bad boy.  Otherwise it was pretty good.  The egg that came with it had a nice, soft yolk in the middle.  My mom just learned how to cook the eggs that way and we both agree it's awesome.  Ask for this dish crispy and you won't be disappointed.2) Beef ramen - Again....underseasoned.  But have to say this is some of the best beef I've had here in Las Vegas.  Nice and soft with a lot of flavor.  Just wish they added more salt or soy sauce to the soup base.  The noodles themselves aren't great - basically the ramen you'd get in most instant ramen.  Nothing like the ramen at Monta.  But the overall dish is pretty awesome.  Definitely a step below Monta but at half the price.  I could eat that beef with any dish and be happy.Overall....a good option and happy they opened.  I can't say that about most of the Asian restaurants in town.  Most of what we have is a dime a dozen.  Big Wong stands out for quality for the price.
4	The little restaurant that could...can...will! Big Wong, located in the same plaza as the famous Monta and the equally famous Raku, is a breath of fresh air in Chinatown. The workers are so happy and welcoming to any customer that walks through the door, the food is prepared with bountiful ladles of love, and the prices are definitely budget-friendly. A perfect place to eat alone or with family and friends. The menu itself is small, with new menu items displayed on the walls. I noticed that there was only one vegetable dish: Fresh Vegetables in Oyster Sauce ($3.95), but I have a feeling if you have a hankering for something non-Oystery (?!?), they will be more than happy to whip something up for you that's not on the menu. I ordered one of the new menu items: the Fried Shrimp Wontons (10 for $4.95)- Large pieces of shrimp only lovingly wrapped in delicate wonton wrappers, and then deep fried to crunchy perfection. Served with a sweet & sour sauce. Delicious! I would order this again!I also tried some of the Chicken Curry and Roti, which was yummy. The curry was spicy and full of hearty potatoes and quality chicken. The roti was both crispy and chewy, and was the perfect dipping tool for the curry. The atmosphere is casual. After you're done eating, you pay up front, so splitting the bill is quite easy. I'll be back!
4	Loved it! Parking was a little bit of a problem, I'm guessing due to raku and monta being in the same strip mall. I'm not sure how I could've missed the huge big wong sign before. We ordered a bunch of things to try - fried shrimp won tons, fried pork chops, beef curry, fried chicken w bones. Everything was $4.95-5.95 and I loved all of it. Service was fast and friendly, sodas (cans) were only $1. Shrimp won tons were light and crispy - basically what you get at dim sum. Filling was all fresh tasting chopped up shrimp, served w sweet chili sauce. Fried pork chop wasn't what I expected, but I still liked it. I thought it would be the usual Chinese style breaded and fried pork chop w a ton of fried garlic on the side. Instead it was more like pork chops dredged in flour and lightly pan fried. A little crispy on the edges and served with rice, a tea egg and delicious brown gravy on the side. Curry was good - lots of big chunks of super tender beef and tendon (which I picked out). The curry flavor was great and the heat kind of crept up on you. Fried chicken was crispy goodness, not much flavor on its own, but served with the same yummy gravy. I preferred to dip it in the sweet chili sauce. We left stuffed, with a $22 check and some leftovers. I kind of wish they had something sweet - milk tea or a small dessert, but its ok we went across the street to shuseki for honey toast! Can't wait to come back to try the ramen and udon.
4	I came for the " Little Big Trouble" UYE. The special was 2 for 1 Beef Ramen so I partnered up with Paolo to grab the deal. The whole thing was a cross of different kinda of soups- between a pho soup and oxtail soup with ramen noodles. The meat and tendon (you can ask with or without) was plentiful and tender so it was stewed long enough. Ramen noodles was quite a lot (more than Monta next door) and had good bite. Soup base was clear and clean broth, but that meant to me I needed to dress it up a bit with green onion, soy sauce, hot sauce to suit my taste. I was hungry since I didn't have lunch and this was super filling. Some people came at different times so we just kinda sat and hung out for hours. By the time people were trickling out the BF was there off work so it was dinner time. We shared-Deep Fried Pork Chop (asked crispy)- Pretty good meat and I like the gravy sauce they give you and the soy boiled egg. Thin Sliced Ribeye- it was tender meat with a bit of fat on it so it's not for the lean beef sliced people. C'mon- it's ribeye. This also came with the gravy sauce and I think it went even better with the ribeye than the chop. Chicken curry w/ roti- the curry had good flavor and had a good sized piece of chicken (bone in) and potato. The roti was light, flaky and very hot so it's made to order. This was both my BF and my favorite and I will definitely grab this again. I had lunch here (about $3 for my half of the 2 for 1), dinner here and the BF had dinner here ($16 for 3 plates and 2 drinks).  I spent about $25 total with tax and tip....that's crazy! Food ranges from $4.95- $8max so its cheap and filling. The service here was friendly and good. We were checked on, water cups were filled often. We weren't rushed out even though we were there for hours on end and I really want to give a shoutout for the hospitality from Wai, Connie and staff! You cant beat the price for the quality nor the staff so I will be back.
4	Came to Big Wong for the "Big Trouble" event on June 17th, and i was greeted by the wonderful chef hubby & wife team as i walked through the door.  The interior of the restaurant was bright and clean with tables spaced out evenly without an overcrowded feeling. The items on the menu all looked really tasty including Hainan chicken (with the choice of white or dark meat), fried chicken cutlet and udon, shrimp and wonton noodle soup (and it comes in a spicy version too!), fried wontons (it looks delish), chicken curry and roti (i ordered this one, i love roti!), and taiwanese beef noodle.Most of all, can't really beat the price here, most items are only $5.95-7.80.  So you can easily sample a couple of items at the price tag of one in most other places.  Bottle and soft drinks are only $1.I'll definitely recommend it to friends who's looking for a good bowl of noodle and wontons.
5	So I've been here 3 times and all three times, I've been impressed by food and service. They just started serving steamed Dungeness Crab! There was a picture posted on Yelp and I was like wait, what, Big Wong has crab?! I called and Connie confirmed they just started that special and they will have it for a couple of days. I immediately came in for dinner and it was glorious. Just steamed crab and placed on top of a bed of ho fun noodles, no seasoning, so you can taste the just out of the ocean flavor. The crab came cracked which made it much easier to enjoy. The sweet and bitter tomalley very good, especially with the juices/flavor all over the noodles. The shrimp soup with shrimp and wonton is really good too. The best shrimp soup I've ever had. It tastes like they took the heads of all the whole shrimp that they use, threw it in a pot and let all the tomalley, shrimpy flavors get all happy together. I really like ramen noodles because it is fresh and not dried. There is a different flavor and texture when it's not dried. I've moved passed Top Ramen.Roti with Chicken Curry is a good starter. The roti is the kind you can get from the Asian supermarket frozen section and pan fry but the chicken curry is not something I can easily make in a jiffy. I also tried the Beef Ramen but I've been eating less beef so it wasn't stand out for me. The fried salt and pepper shrimp is good. The shrimp is not the largest but they do keep the heads on like Chinese restaurants should, so we literally ate the entire plate from shrimp head to tail.The server/cashier FOH person, Connie, is super nice and she knows how to make you feel at home (in a Chinese restaurant). It's not fine dining but for a quick Chinese restaurant, you just need efficiency.
3	Came here for the buy one beef ramen, get the second free special with my boyfriend. We both got the beef ramen (of course) and an order of the fried shrimp wanton things. The beef was really tender and juicy, the noodles perfect. The broth wasn't really strong enough for me, but good. I would have liked more condiments to add to it, instead of just onions and chilli sauce.The fried shrimp wantons were DIVINE, though. Absolute love at first bite! The waitress was super sweet, taking her time to explain the menu to us, and always appearing whenever we needed something. The food was really inexpensive as well,  which I love.. Since I'm cheap.
4	Keep it simple.  That's what Big Wong is about!  Concentrate on doing a few dishes right and that's what I like.  =)  Overall their menu is only about 20ish items but really they are only various combinations of a base of 10 dishes?- Hoi Nam Chicken - Basic braised chicken dish that is simple to make but not everyone can make tasty.  They got it right here.  The rice had a nice essence of chicken, the chicken was slightly salted and when paired with the sweet and tangy sauce of the side, it was quite scrumptious.- Beef Stew - Oh comfort food.  This is it!  It had a slightly spicy kick with the sauce.  Even in warm weather, this was comforting.- Veggies and Oyster Sauce - This dish was a little sub par.  Veggies were chopped to 2" chunks which left the fun out of eating our greens!- Bonus:  Fried Shrimp Wonton - They served us these fresh out of the fryer!  Great shrimp flavor and happy surprise.Conclusion:  Big Wong is a great place for simple dishes with good taste. 3.5 stars
4	Been here a few times already. Same friendly waitress! Which is rare for a chinese restaurant. great prices!! its cheap and good. Im a fan of the curry chicken and beef ramen.  Their wontons have no meat in it, its 100% shrimp.
4	Food is decent and cheap. Try the tea boiled egg, a true unique eat.salt and peppered fried Chicken wings are a must try they come out piping hot to the core so be careful!
4	Mmm good food from this family run business. Got in there for a UYE with me but my "date" (see pics, haha thanks Judd and Lynn) wasn't hungry so I ate her shrimp wonton soup. Full of flavor with no filler (ie. bok choy and char siu bits). Then I followed it up by demolishing my beef ramen. Great if you're in the area looking for Asian food. Just solid, hearty helpings with their selection ranging from Malaysian chicken curry with roti to your straight, no chaser Chinese food. However don't know if I'll trek all the way from the border of Henderson (which is where I live) to visit. I enjoyed my time there with the Yelp crew, Judd, Lynn and the owners as they were incredibly gracious and generous hosts with the TWO FOR 1 ramen bowl deal!! Yee!
5	This place is inexpensive and totally the best place for a family and quick meal...1.  Location and Parking - Very easy.2.  Hours - They open at 10:00 am.How great is that3.  Food - Here we go...a.  Hoi Nam Gai Fan or Hainanese Chicken Rice - I love this stuff. I can eat so much of it.  How places do you know have this here in Vegas?b.  Beef Noodles - Brooth is awesome. The meat is just like in San Francisco, the Brisket and tendons cooked to a very tender style.c.  Rib Eye and Rice - Flavorful and tender.d.  Curry Beef and rice - Again, they use the braised brisket of beef.  This is so tasty!4.  Decor - Just fine for 5.00 meals.5.  You gotta go. Divert from the fast food places and come here. This is so cheap and good it is ridiculous.IT Rocks.
4	Another great visit - same great food at dirt cheap prices. This time we tried curry chicken w rice, pork chops again, crab w noodles, chicken wings and beef noodle soup. I think I liked the chicken curry better than the beef because it had potatoes. It was $16 for the whole crab, and was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again. It was a steamed crab served over flat rice noodles with a soy ginger dipping sauce on the side. The crab itself was kind of small and the head was emptied, which is a shame since the best part is mixing rice into whatever juice is in the crabs head. Chicken wings were as delicious as they look -  crunchy, slight heat from the jalapenos. I'm thinking it has a lot of msg, which is fine w me. It was prepared basically how salt and pepper pork chops are in Chinese restaurants. I was a little disappointed in the noodle soup. The brisket was great just like in the curry - fork tender and full of flavor. Noodles were good, but the broth was pretty bland. I just tried some of my friends, but its probably good if you add siracha hot sauce and soy sauce. They've added the specials written on the wall to their menu, which is a huge help. Another positive is that they have fun soft drinks! We had Welch's grape soda and Sunkist orange soda! Can't go wrong with that.
4	Although we were not too impressed with the food the first time we came here, we thought we would give this place another try after reading all the good reviews about it.  Well, I can officially say that I am a fan now. What a difference a couple months make as their dishes are now so flavourful and delicious.  We ordered the beef ramen (Japanese ramen with Chinese style beef stew combo), curry beef over rice and stir fried ong choy. The beef ramen came with quite a lot of stewed beef and tendons and a very generous portion of ramen.  For lunch and $5.95 this was more than enough to fill the tummy.  The broth was quite tasty and the stewed beef was very tender. The curry beef was also very good with just the right amount of curry spice for me.  There wasn't quite enough curry sauce for the big bowl of rice though.  I had to ask for a little more sauce to finish up my rice. The stir fried ong choy with shrimp paste was okay for me.  It could have been a little more flavorful, but not bad for the price of $4.95.  Great food with dirt cheap prices!!  I will definitely be back to try their other dishes.  I took one star away because I had to ask for more curry sauce and the customer sat behind me did the same for his wonton noodle soup.
5	Since last visit, I have sampled:chicken curry- w/ roti;  good solid yellow curry, I prefer more heat myslef, but it's good for the masses... roti is served Chinese see-tyle, like a pancake....ask if you want more crispy, they will fry it longer.....BIG portion! I barely finished it and had food coma later.fried porkchop- thinly fried filets of pork, with a special gravy for dipping...had to get extra gravy cuz i poured it all over the rice, yummmm.if you want more pizazzzzz, ask them to make it with the salt n pepper batter...that's how Wai makes it for himself....as always, friendly service, i feel more like friends or family.... we always talk about food or New York or whatever.....for any new readers, this place is solid and the prices can't be beat.....there is no other joint like this in town, at least with a variety menu like this.....so come and try it....you'll like itif it's not Big Wong then it can't be right....C
3	The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. There were't any other patrons while we were there, so the service was quick and attentive.Most of the dishes are extremely cheap. We had some chicken wings that tasted great. It's definitely fun to be able to choose a few different dishes to eat as opposed to the one or two you'd be limited to at most other restaurants where the prices are higher. Overall a fun place to have a bite of cheap tasty food.
4	Shrimp Won Tons- This is one of the best things I've ever eaten for both taste and value. You get 10 for $4.95. They were perfectly cooked and the shrimp was succulent.Stir-fried Bok Choy- You get a huge order which is too much to finish and they were a tad too greasy. A half order would be perfect.Salt & Peper Chicken Wings- My boyfriend loved these. You get 10 for $4.95. Chicken Curry with Roti Pancakes- The curry, potatoes and pancakes were all yummy.The waitress was wonderful, helpful and had a really happy positive attitude. Overall, we're defintely going back later this year when we're in Vegas again to try the Salt & Pepper Shrimp and the Shrimp Soup!
4	**Summary**       - Flavor - The slow cooked beef in the beef ramen is definitely a head turner. Some of their other items are a bit hit or miss.       - Value - You can't go wrong with most of the dishes being under $5. This place is, without a doubt, a good value       - Decor - The inside is simple and reminds me a lot of the hole in the wall restaurants in cali. However, those places are also really good.**Ordered**       - $5.95 #15 Beef Ramen - Slow cooked fork tender beef brisket in ramen. The broth really has the flavor of the beef in it. This is a must try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=_Ol_FjEJS3TDp11m7amNLQ).       - $4.95 #21 Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - The chicken was moist and delicious. I tend to like salty foods so this was perfectly seasoned for me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=MOolbZ9HluooQUfoGXmCeQ).       - $4.95 #2 Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken Over Special Seasoned Rice - The chicken comes with a soy based sauce and a chili sauce rather than the usual ginger and green onion sauce. The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce and rice were tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=vLkVcA20AojLDusn38f2fA).       - $4.95 #8 Authentic Curry Chicken Service with 3 Roti Pancakes - Chicken was a little dry and the potatoes were under cooked. The curry was OK, but the roti pancakes, if you don't mind a bit of oil, were spectacular. I'd order the pancakes alone if I could (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=Mrul8D6-5mwJ-26rna6d5w).**Recommendations**       - I'd recommend this place for a cheap meal. The beef ramen is probably one of the best I've had.
3	The dishes I picked are so-so. The beef ramen is pretty good though. Hanoi Chicken - really dry. I wonder why they don't have the ginger and green onion sauce....The flavored rice is decent. Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - kinda salty. I think there are a lot of MSG since I sorta got a headache after lunch. The food's really cheap so I guess three stars will do.
5	A small menu but every item is a gem. The waitress explained every dish. We had chicken curry , beef curry, special rice, a roti pancake, beef ramen, salt and pepper chicken wings, and shrimp wonton soup. Delicious and very reasonably priced.
5	Certainly can't beat the price, the curry that came with the roti canai was wonderful.  Wife had the soup udon and loved it!  Can't wait to go back and try other items.
5	I went back again and had to review.They have expanded the menu, and usually this makes me worry, but they are doing it right.I tried the Ribeye Steak Special, a thick cut choice ribeye, with rice, and one side (I went with baby bok choy).  All for only $9.95!!!The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, and the prices are insanely cheap, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out.
4	I have been here twice and was not disappointed either times.My favorite has to be the curry chicken with roti (pancakes).  The chicken in the curry is oh-so tender. Take a piece of that chicken, put it on a piece of the warm fluffy crispy roti, dip that into the curry...yum yum yum.  The curry has so much flavor.The Hoi Nam chicken with rice, on the other hand, was a tad bit dry.  The rice was delicious though.  Maybe because we got the white meat??? Either way, I will give dark meat a try next time.Pork Chop over rice...the main star for us, however, is the egg.  How did  the chef got the yolk of the hard boiled egg to be soft and fluffy beats me...it was definitely interesting in the good way.  The pork chop tasted good with that gravy that accompanied it.Beef ramen was actually tasty.  I am not a big fan of beef, but I thought it was season nicely, with tender tendon and beef brisket.  There was a lot of noodles in there too.  We got really full.I have to say though, the staff are super friendly.  My cup was always half full :)and I must also mention that the prices are cheap...
5	Bing wong you're a song you make me want to roll my tummy down and munch!!!Thats how much I love big wong! Its simple no nonsense cheap food who bring a delight to your tummy and absolute bliss to those hainanese chicken rice.Having eaten hainanese chicken rice in London, Los Angeles, Singapore and Jakarta, I can honestly says that they have one of those great one that remind you of home. Thank you las vegas for having big wong and if you ever in las vegas and would like to try some extraorinary cuisine that will not make a hole in your pocket. Get your ass in here. Order some fried wonton, followed with number 2. OH YEAH!!!
2	I had been itching to try this place because of all the raving reviews on the great prices Bing Wong has to offer. My friend and I came here Monday during our lunch break from CSN. Perfect prices for starving college students. To our surprise the interior of the place was really nice and clean. My friend was expecting something iffy inside since the windows were all black on the outside. Right when we walk in, a man sitting at a table points to tables that are apparently hit with the air conditioned well. Then our waitress asks for our drinks, when she came back she immediately asked if we were ready to order. Since we were both first timers we asked for more time to look over the menu. She left as soon as we answered and then she literally walked to the cash register and came right back to ask us if we were ready to order for the second time. This was kind of irritating especially since the gap she gave us was practically 30 seconds. None the less we ordered. I ordered the rib eye over pasta, while my friend ordered the curry beef. The orders came pretty fast, which was good since we were both hungry. However the food wasn't as pleasing as we had hoped. steak over pasta- no special char on the steak, which makes me think it was cooked on a regular skillet (similar to how my parents would cook it in the kitchen) and then the pasta was angel hairwith some sauce on the side. We both expected some type of asian noodles rather than angel hair, oh well . The sauce did give the dish a little flavor but overall it was still kinda bland. This dish was okay, I don't think I would order it again. curry beef- the color of the beef was brown while were expecting a mustard color.  None the less there was still faint taste of curry. It wasn't as strong as we like. Yet again another dish I don't think I would order again. Although the prices are extremely cheap, I don't know if I recommend anyone else to come here. But I always do like to give places with great reviews a second chance and I probably will since it's so cheap. I mean what do I have to lose, right?
5	Their menu prices are pretty excellent. You probably won't even believe it. Dishes are MOSTLY $4.95 with a select few that are slightly higher, but the majority is $4.95. Talk about a bargain.I really like their salt and pepper pork chops (spicy, though) and their beef ramen ($5.95) was a pretty big portion (I anticipated something smaller).I'll always be coming back here and eventually I'll try most of their menu :).
3	OK, my second update is because I have found myself craving Big Wong's Hainan Chicken twice in the last 3 days. The first time was while we were at an Eastside Asian restaurant where the Hainan Chicken was $18/half $25/whole and I thought to myself, "Man, for this kind of money I could be up to my neck in Hainan Chicken at Big Wong!" And the second time was just now. Talk about slow simmer, it's been a couple months since I've eaten there and I want to go back. "You don't know what you got till it's gone." - Cinderella (1988)I will do my best to campaign for Big Wong to be on our Mr. Tofu Circle Of Frequent Eats (I just made that up, we don't actually have an official Mr. Tofu Circle Of Frequent Eats, but it sounds cool - like a Disneyland ride.) I am happy that Big Wong exists. The value is undeniable. It will be my next solo meal mission for sure!
5	4.5 stars rounded up.  I adore the ppl that work here.  Forgive me if I misspell their names, but Wei and Huyen are just so wonderful and friendly.  More importantly, they had no qualms about recommending other types of restaurants.  It just shows that they're genuine ppl.  Wei definitely pays attention to every detail of his restaurant.  Even the bathroom was spotless.  I saw him take his lunch with a couple of customers that looked to be regulars.  This is a very down to earth place.  As for the food, I thought it was good.  I had the beef ramen.  I was given plenty meat, and when I was running low on broth, Huyen brought over more broth.  I had some left over, and she packed it up for me and included extra broth.  Incredible customer service.  My fiancee ordered the Hainanese chicken and salt baked shrimp.  I thought both dishes were good.  The chicken itself was not very flavorful though.  I know that it is simply poached, but I've had it before where it was more gingery.  Wei mentioned that he was vamping the menu soon to include new dishes and some desserts.  I can't wait to come back and see what he has to offer!
4	I have been to the Big Wong ,twice and both times the food was pretty good.           The first time I had the Hainan chicken and the shrimp won tons with ramen  The hainan chicken and the dipping sauce was  solid and the rice was flavorful.           Shrimp won ton ramen was tasty, the won tons had whole pieces of shrimp inside. I know some people rave about this but I prefer a  minced shrimp filling with water chestnuts , green onions etc.  The broth was clear and flavorful , the ramen was cooked perfectly.                            My second trip ordered the crispy pork chop, but got the crispy chicken instead, no problem I can adapt. The problem was the chicken lacked flavor and the dipping sauce was the pan drippings and was not very good.   I also had the beef curry  with rice and no tendons,  ,glad they asked  if I wanted tendon's given choice I rather eat meat then tendons.  I'll eat tendons if I'm still hungry and its the only thing left on my plate.             The beef curry was very good and more then made up for the crispy chicken.  I rate the food a very solid  3 stars and with the great service and super value it gets another star . Big Wong you get a 4 star review , thank you I will be back!!
3	Its a little awkward telling someone you just ate at Big Wong...."You just ate a big.....what?" HA HA HACheap Chinese Food doesn't have a positive ring to it. But this place is all about good food, good prices, good quality. Most Chinese restaurants are overly greasy and leave you with a less than satisfactory taste of MSG. But you'll leave Big Wong's with a full tummy and they won't put a dent in your bank account.Right next door to Monta, they're not there to have a ramen battle. Their ramen is NOT Japanese style; its a cross between pho & oxtail soup with ramen noodles thrown in. But there's so much variety, be sure to try the rest of the menu--99% of it is $4.95. So don't be cheap and order a few different dishes. A few suggestions: crispy shrimp wontons, salt & pepper wings, & the chicken curry.Happy NOM-ing.TIP: Call ahead! They do take-out and they use quality containers, not those cheesy chinese-y boxes.
4	Went here in response to the article in the weekly and was not disappointed. We were greeted with a friendly smile and our server was one of the sweetest people I have ever met, she was just wonderful! On to the food: beef ramen, spicy shrimp and wonton ramen, Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, salt and pepper fried pork chop, chicken wings , the boiled chicken( we chose the dark meat) with rice and two dipping sauces ( forget what it was called)  and garlic bok choy. Yes we were hungry, and ended up taking half of it home. Everything was delicious, not one complaint about the experience as a whole. We will definitely be back .
4	First of all, I commend the owners for opening a restaurant next to both Raku and Monta, highly rated and well loved restaurants.  In a move I was almost ashamed to make steps from Monta, I got the beef ramen.  It was as good as I've had anywhere.  The broth was delicious and the slow cooked beef was tender and delicious.  It was the first time I had beef tendon and I was pleasantly surprised.  We also got the curry dish with pancakes and that was very good as well.  Most of the dishes are around $5 and are very generous portions.We were there when they were not busy and the staff was super friendly and helpful to us picking out dishes.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and even discovered a delicious type of chili sauce that they have on the tables that I have since purchased and use at home.There was not much fault in our experience, but I have to mention that it smelled pretty bad in the dining room the night we were there.  Not joking, the restrooms smelled better than the dining room.  My wife wanted to walk out right away the smell was so strong.  Get that figured out and I'll go back.
5	Coming from NY , have had trouble finding a good Chinese restaurant...Big Wong is fabulous...Have tried most everything on the menu and have not been disappointed!!
4	Limited menu, but good cheap eats with most dishes $6 or less.+ Curry chicken was a large portion of tender chunks of chicken and potatoes in a delicious curry sauce with a bit of heat. Came with white rice+ Food came out quickly. Probably waited less than 10 minutes.+ Wasn't busy when I stopped by around noon on a Monday.+ Clean interior
5	I have been back more times than I can count, and the food is always top notch. Recently I have been on a Ramen fix, their Beef Ramen is some of the best I've ever had, they serve up a big bowl, the broth is rich, they aren't skimpy with the beef, and you can get tendon if you like. (I'm not a tendon fan but it was pretty decent.) And it's under $6!They also have a steak special that is Under $10, the steak is good (cooked on a flat top so it's a little different) and the sides are fresh (the baby bok choi is amazing)!Also they've been serving up a mango pudding, I don't know if it's on the menu officially yet, but it's really good, and I'm sure they'll serve up an order for you if you want.I have to go back to try the Soy Sauce Chicken and the other new Chicken Special.The staff is friendly and the price is cheap, it's hard to beat Big Wong.you know I'll be back
5	MAKE A RUN FOR IT! Ran through my head as I walked into Big Wong today. The parking lot was full and when I walked in, the restaurant was eerily empty. That would be enough for me to turn around and show myself out, but I remembered how good the food was the last time. Instead of turning heel, I sat in the corner table upfront. 10 minutes pass, no one came in. I really had this place to myself. Out comes my beef ramen with tendon and I questioned why it was dead at 4:30 on a Thursday. The beef was plentiful, tender, juicy, large chunks. The tendon were melt in your mouth good. There were double takes to make sure I was not devouring colossal pieces of fat. The noodles had more of a chew than my tendons. Take that as a compliment, because there is nothing worst than over cooked noodles. These had the perfect bite. The broth is simple and flavorful. Sriracha and green onions are the condiments provided and that was enough flavor to get me to pick up the bowl and slurp down every last drop. I ended my meal with a mango pudding. The bits of mango floating within was a nice touch.Now let me go all Rachel Ray on everybody; Beef Ramen $5.95, Mango Pudding $1.25, and tip=$10. That is a meal that is easy on the wallet.The waitress is very soft spoken and meek. With that being said, she was extremely nice, very unlike other Chinese restaurants.
3	Cheap, quick, and solid Chinese food off the strip.  The Mom and Pop restaurant houses a relatively simple space that serves a variety of rice, noodle, and soup dishes.  Prices are great with everything under $10 and the orders come out fast.  Appears popular with the Chinese speaking crowd. Beef Ramen - several reviews mention this so we had to order.  In reality, it's just Chinese beef noodle soup but using ramen noodles.  Perhaps an attempt by the owners to capitalize on the ramen craze. Overall, broth was clear and tasty but not as flavorful as most top ramen places in California or NYC.   Beef pieces were very tender and the tendons were melt in your mouth. Hainan Chicken - tender boneless dark chicken meat.  Had to ask for the minced garlic.  Overall found the dish a bit muted in flavor but better with the sauces. Baby bok choy - stir fried in wok.  Standard fare.  Salt and pepper chicken wings - delicious.  Nice slices of pepper.  Perfectly deep fried. Good stuff. Overall we had a good meal.  Big Wong isn't in the league of any joint in SF, LA, Vancouver or NYC but for Vegas, it's a nice find.  Their soy sauce chicken looks fantastic...maybe next time. Big Wong accepts credit cards but not Amex.
5	Finally made it to this restaurant and it soooo good!  And cheap!  Try the steamed chicken with mushrooms, chinese sausage, and broccoli.  Extremely tasty.  We also tried the baby bok choy, chicken curry roti, steamed chicken, beef curry, and salt and pepper wings.  All that for $26!  We couldn't eat all the food and have leftovers for dinner tomorrow.  You really can't beat it.  I could probably eat three plates of the chicken curry roti, if left to my own devices.No alcohol, but some folks in the back were doing BYOB.
3	I came here by myself for a quick lunch the other day.  I ordered nothing but their house special ~ Beef ramen.  Everything was fine except this time it wasn't as tasty as the 1st time I had it.  I saw more new menu items on the wall.  And yes, they are serving congee now but only one kind, can't remember what kind though.  If you like eating dirt cheap and authentic Chinese comfort food.  Come here!!
4	This place quickly became a new favorite. $4.95 for a hearty, authentic meal that fills me up?! I'm there! Already tried a few dishes: the beef ramen $5.95, the pork chop with udon $4.95, 2 different chicken and rice dishes $4.95 ea., steak and rice dish $4.95... the chef is more than willing to adjust a dish to your needs (for example, I order everything extra spicy. He doesn't just throw in hot sauce either, he actually cooks the broth spicy!). There is a great selection on the menu... rice, noodles, soups, curries, vegetables, etc. A daily special is listed on the wall. Their ramen and udon noodle soups are FANTASTIC; however, they are missing vegetables. It's just noodles and broth with meat in the bowl or on the side. They do provide a metal container of green onions to add to the soup, but I think the dishes would be 5 stars if they had more substance (onions, cabbage, bamboo, etc..) However, if you don't like vegetables, this place is definitely for you!So in a nutshell... great food, decent service (authentic Chinese-style), unbeatable prices, and dishes come out quickly. I most certainly recommend it!
4	Finally got to try this place after months of reading the reviews and dreaming of a big bowl of shrimp wonton soup. It was well worth the wait. The wontons were delicious, the broth was a little spicy, which I loved, and the ramen was perfectly cooked. Pricing was more than reasonable and I left very sated.
5	We went here for the first time after the Elite Event at PJ Clarke's with a bunch of other Yelpers.  The predominant thought running through my head after looking at this menu was "Why the hell did it take me so long to come here??".Super cheap prices!  You could spend more and get far less at any fast food restaurant.  I got the Hai Nam chicken and my wife for the shrimp soup with udon.  Both were very tasty and filling.  We finished up our meal splitting an almond jello dessert for a whopping bill of $11.20.Great, friendly service too.  The staff knew a lot of the guys in the group by name.  The owner came in to say hello and gave us a few plates of shrimp wonton appetizers on the house.  There were so many other dishes that looked great.  A lot of people in the group doubled up on entrees since they were so cheap and I look forward to trying more of the menu.  Consider me a Big Wong believer!!
3	3 stars for the food, 4 stars for the price, 1 star for the service. Ambiance? Well, it's a classic 'cheap eats, hole-in-the-wall joint', so nuff said. Read about the place in an old Las Vegas Weekly mag and put it on the list of 'places to try'. My guy was hungry for beef ramen, so we had beef ramen, hoi nam chicken with special rice, and salt n pepper chicken wings. The beef ramen was tasty but um... it tasted like pho. The broth had that distinct 'anise' flavor that adding 'five spice' brings. Our first tip off should have been when our chubby waitress said "you want tendons with that?" (we did). If you want your ramen to taste like pho, this is the place. The hoi nam chicken came with special rice and 2 sauces. The rice and sauces made the poached chicken very yummy. The star was the salt n pepper chicken wings. I would go back for them wings and for anything else they serve 'salt n pepper'  style. That was the winner! Our 3 orders set us back about $15, less than a drink at a hi-style restaurant on the Strip, so no complaints about the price. The service was a joke. The chubby waitress with the pony tail and glasses was/is the quintessential inefficient wait help: slow to come over and take your order, slow in bringing the check, all the while acting flustered like she is overwhelmed (the place doesn't have a zillion tables). The party next to us finally got tired of waiting for their check so they just left money on the table and walked out, the chubby waitress barely took notice... guess she figured they left money, so why rush over. How's that for slow service?
2	I've certainly had better noodles and food.  The restaurant is a mixture of Chinese with some Malaysian and Japanese thrown in.  The chef is Chinese but I think he really needs to be careful but his seasoning of his food especially the noodle soups.  The soup was bland.  Salt and pepper chicken wings were good, and so was the chicken curry with the roti.  The Hainanese Chicken rice was just OK.  The chicken was over cooked.  I must say it's cheap but the food had better be good too in order for the people to keep flocking here.
5	Wow.. This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I order Deep fried chicken udon soup and it was so good. The server were so friendly and the food was so cheap!
4	First time dining @ Big Wong Restaurant tonight.  Found this place thanks to Yelp. Ordered the following items:- curry chicken w/ 3 roti pancakes (curry was flavorful, but it's small dish with about 3 pieces of chicken & 2 potatoes)- house special shrimp wonton with ramen soup (came with 5 shrimp wontons; loved the broth - just the right taste to my liking, wasn't too salty; did not skimp on the ramen)- special deep fried chicken over rice (chicken was fried just right.. really juicy and really liked how it was boneless.. however we weren't not crazy about the sauce it came with. We just dipped our chicken in the curry from the prior dish.)Our meal with an order of 2 sodas came to just over $16.00! What a deal! Our server (who may be one of the owners) was pretty friendly as well. Not an extensive selection of items on the menu, but we are still looking forward to our next visit & trying different items. So if you're looking for cheap eats, this is the place!
5	We had a party of 10. The server was so nice and very knowledgeable. The food was very delicious and afforable. We had no problems with our food. Everything was so good. My favorite dish was deep fried shrimp wonton (it is so crispy and juicy), fried chicken wings and the $1.00 dessert roti (it is so addicting). I will come back to this place in the future.
4	Big wong, so right!Loved loved the beef/tendon "ramen".  It was the clear kind and the broth was sooo good.  The noodles are true to the ramen name.  Chewy, delicious, but more the kind you find in japanese noodles, not hong kong/chinese style beef stew.  The rest of the items were good but if you come, come for the beef stew ramen for sure.
5	Most of dishes come with rice are $4.95 all day! Curry chicken is really good. Soy sauce chicken is good for two people($6.95) but you need to pay $0.75 for a bowl of rice. It is my favorite! Sweetened pancake is good too, only $1/each. Love this place, good service, good food and good price. Their bathroom is nice and clean too!
4	Was craving for some taiwanese beef noodles and found this place listed as one of them since ay chung went out of business.  We went in and there were only a few customers in there, but oh well we went pretty early on a weekday (about 6pm). The prices are the lowest for chinese food I have seen in the LV area. We ordered  a curry chicken pancake as appetizer, beef noodles, and wonton noodles. Of course we were way too greedy, we couldn't finish everything for the 2 of us (not to mention my husband also a mango pudding for dessert).  Everything taste great and the prices are too good to be true. The only disappointment is my husband wanted some taiwanese beef stew noodles and the one from big wong is not quite it (even though it tastes good).  The owners are very friendly and attentive. Big wong is a must go place if you want some cheap HK style food.
4	Chicken curry roti and beef curry over rice were delicious. Also recommend the almond pudding with lychee.
4	Super cheap and relatively large portions.  Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite to eat for lunch or dinner.  none of the dishes were mind blowing, but definitely better than some of the other places located by China Town...
5	ordered curry chicken with roti, salt and pepper chicken wing and almond pudding.everything taste good.service is excellent. you must try the almond pudding. it's really good.
5	I had a late lunch with my husband and 5-yr old son at Big Wong. We read a review in Seven magazine and had to try the crispy shrimp wontons. The wontons were exactly as described - light, crispy, and very flavorful. I had the special deep fried chicken over rice. Very good. My son had the special shrimp wonton soup and Mr. Picky-eater scarfed most of it down. We brought the leftovers home & he just finished off the last of it. My husband had the beef ramen and salt & pepper chicken wings. He proclaimed it all delicious. We split the fresh vegetables in oyster sauce and I have to say, they were perfectly steamed with just the right amount of oyster sauce, not swimming in it. Lastly, I topped it off with the almond pudding. Heavenly with a nice amount of lychees mixed in. 2 appetizers, 3 substantial main courses, 1 side dish enough for all three of us, and dessert came in right at $30. Anywhere else would have run us $50-$70.The restaurant was small, but very clean and they keep the kitchen open to view, and it was very evident the owners take a lot of pride in keeping things clean and hygienic. The ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and very clean. Usually, restrooms in most restaurants can be a bit scary. I say if the owners put this much attention on cleanliness and quality in their restrooms, an area often overlooked by other eating establishments, then they must put even more emphasis on cleanliness in the kitchen and the quality of the food. In this case, I'm right. All through the meal, I heard the chef (owner?) directing the cooks with cautions on not to overcook this, oversteam that, etc... It is clear they take a lot of pride in their business and are committed to delivering quality at prices that are extremely easy on the wallet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
3	It's definitely a good place to get Chinese food in CHEAP PRICE. You can get big portion of Hainam chicken rice for $5, and Hong Kong style milk tea for just a dollar. Nowhere can beat their price! Reason I only gave it 3 stars?? I am a foodie and I care about how food tastes more than its price. Their food comes in big portion but flavor is okay. "Dungeness crab over rice noodles" only serves by order in advance. You have to call in the morning and place order in advance. Then restaurant staff will buy fresh crab from market and do preparation before you come in. I gave it 3.5 stars in my opinion.
2	The noodles were bland. I ordered the noodles with steak and my friend ordered the curry noodles.  Both were bland.  The prices were good and the service was friendly but this place was not worth going back to especially since it's in the same shopping square as Monta.
3	today i went to try their steam crab with flat rice noodle and curry beef. I needed to order the crab dish when I woke up. Then they went to a chinese super market to buy the fresh one for you. when I arrived, they show me the raw crab. I waited about 20mins. When it came, it looks so fresh, i felt the crab' soul was still there and begging me not to eat it, but i did eat it. Taste very good. The curry beef was not bad but i felt that it missed something. i didnt know what it missed, dont ask me. I perfer u and me cafe's curry. and the dishes are very cheap. so it worth to try.
5	this place is awesome.  the food tastes great, the prices are reasonable, and the owners are friendly.  my personal favorite is the salt and pepper chicken wings and the fried chicken ramen.  i have eaten the beef ramen, steam chicken, chicken curry, shrimp won ton ramen, ribs in black bean sauce, crispy shrimp won ton, and choy sum.  ALL tastes great.
5	I love wontons and have searched the world over for great wontons. I have hit all the top wonton cities: Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Vancouver, L.A., S.F. and found some of the best shrimp wontons at The Big Wong in Vegas, who knew??? Wonton lovers, you won't be disappointed. :D  We also tried their fried pork chops served with a freshly made sauce,  excellent and their Roti (a sweet fried crepe Thai dessert) was to die for.Owners were very friendly, prices very fair. Overall, this will be one of my favorite Vegas eats.
3	First off I wish you could give half stars.This was a solid 3and a half stars for me. Went last night with the hubby around 10:30 pm (they close at 11pm) there were two tables of customers one of which the owner was sitting at. She got up quickly and welcomed us in. We ordered several dishes to share. Beef ramen, shrimp wonton soup(no noodles), salt and pepper chicken wings and fried shrimp wontons.The order of fried wontons came out in less than 5 minutes! they were all shrimp and delicious but just a tad bit greasy. Beef ramen and wonton soup came next. Hubby started to eat the ramen and I could tell after two bites he was so not into it. My wonton soup was great..filled with tender all shrimp wontons nice greens and a very soothing broth. I said lets switch. He gladly gave me the big bowl of ramen( have to say the portion for 4.95 is quite large) The noodles were okay(not overcooked which for me would be a huge sin for ramen) the beef was tender but fatty and the broth..eww just not for us. Then came the chicken wings just in time to save the day! OMG! So delicious! Perfectly crispy skin and amazingly juicy with just the right amount of spice. Would go again just for the wings! The chef and owner came by to ask how everything was and noticed right away the still full bowl of ramen and asked what was wrong. We told them the noodles were good and beef was okay ..the broth just not to our taste. They explained to us they use plain broth in their ramen (not seasoned and no msg). We said no problem three out of four is not bad . We were soon finished and got the check. I was a little surprised they didn't take the ramen off the bill but I didn't feel that bad cause it was only 4.95. But having been a small business owner myself..I would have instantly taken it off the bill. Nonetheless I think they might get a second visit from me. Three out of four dishes being good and the prices being so affordable..I am eager to try more dishes especially the whole dungeness crab.
3	I very late with this review, but better late than never. We shared chicken curry with roti, salt and pepper wings, and won ton soup. Tasty and cheap. Next time I'd order the curry with rice not because the roti was bad just because I missed the rice. Though, we came for dinner. I think this would be a great lunch spot.
4	I am so glad that I gave Big Wong a second chance because the first time I came during opening week I was NOT a fan.  In fact, I was shocked that this restaurant was getting such rave reviews.  Perhaps I had come on a bad day.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes.  Anyways, I decided to give it another try because I was craving Ramen and the wait at Monta was ridiculous.  And I am now grateful that Monta was so busy because I am a converted fan.  My husband and in-laws ordered the Beef Ramen with tendons.  The broth was so delicious, the tender beef was plentiful, as was the tendons.  Just a perfect bowl of soup on a cold winter night.  I had plans to order the Ramen also, but when I saw the "Special shrimp soup with wontons" advertised on the wall- I just could not resist.  The broth was just bursting with shrimpyness.  My husband didn't  like it for that exact reason, but I was swooning.  It must have taken a lot of shrimp heads to pack that much flavor into that bowl.  I usually never ever finish my bowls of soup, but I just could not stop eating it.  I was already full, but thought it would be such a shame to let this deliciousness go to waste.  Thank you Monta for being so crowded because Big Wong has found a new loyal fan in me.  Even my VERY Chinese in-laws who we literally had just picked up from the airport after a long flight from Hong Kong gave it 2 thumbs up.  And trust me, that is no easy feat.
3	Cheap decent eats. I've had a few things there that were quite good and a few things that were mediocre, but the food is so cheap that I could pick and choose on the menu and be satisfied. I'd have to say that I did like the special curry beef. Dark, Indian like curry sauce. The menu indicates that it is spicy, but I was disappointed with its heat level. The salt and pepper chicken wings and the shrimp wontons were excellent, but I think this  place definitely needs to improve their dipping sauces. I think they handed me some Sysco generic sweet and sour sauce with my wontons, and it ruined them. Like I said, it's decent, but I wasn't "wowed" or anything.
5	I admit that I was a little skeptical when I saw the hole in the wall environment and plastic utensils. But then the food came, and I just kept ordering more. The Hoi Nam chicken rice was authentic and delicious. The curry beef over rice was wonderful. I ordered and enjoyed every dessert on the menu. Oh and then the price: $5 for an entree and $1.25 for dessert. I'm very picky with my Asian food, and this place exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Highly recommended!
4	Cheap eats, friendly service, and tasty Chinese food! Highlights include fried shrimp wontons, curry brisket with tendons (ngau lam), and mango pudding. Definitely will be going back!
5	Great shrimp wontons!  Even better with some noodles in the bowl.  Salt and pepper chicken wings are spicy, crispy, salty, and oh so wonderful with the bowl of soup.  Almond pudding is the better of the two puddings I think.  For $4.95, it's a great meal.  Hurry before this secret is out of the bag and prices are raised!
5	A great casual dining find!  Not too far off of the strip and worth jumping over for a quick bite of Chinese food.  Steamed chicken and seasoned rice is delicious and healthy. Curry over rice was good. Chrispy won tons were very good.  They have daily specials. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes on my next trip!
4	The beef ramen was so good... and quite the value! Definitey will go back to try the rest of the menu.
4	Did you know that a medium-sized bowl of wonton noodle soup will set you back $18 and a bowl of udon soup costs $22 on the Vegas strip?  If you are like me and find those prices outrageous for very average tasting food, then head a couple miles to Big Wong's on Spring Mountain Road!Everything is under $10, with most items under $6.I enjoyed a late lunch with my family here & we ordered a couple Shrimp wonton noodle soups, one spicy shrimp wonton soup, the salt & pepper chicken, the salt & pepper shrimp, chicken curry roti, and the hainan boneless chicken with seasoned rice.  The food was excellent all around but the broth in the spicy shrimp soup was the best I've had in a long time!  One thing to note - the roti bread that comes with the chicken curry is not the typical South Asian variety you find at an Indian restaurant.  Rather, it is a flaky sesame "bing" (Chinese pancake) - the type you can buy frozen from the Asian market for $1.  Still very good, just FYI.Next time, I'm going to try the soy sauce chicken. The table next to ours ordered it just before we finished our meal and it looked delicious!
5	I haven't been back to Big Wong's since their grand opening. I finally made my way back last night in need of some cheap eats and I'm sad I haven't been back sooner. We ordered the curry chicken with roti, beef ramen and sweet roti for dessert. They have a much more extensive menu than before and they also have daily specials that look delightful. All the food is still incredibly cheap for the portions and quality, which you just can't argue with. I enjoyed this visit quite a bit more than our first visit and I'm already craving some more of their cheap eats. There aren't many places that you can have a sit down meal, including dessert and a drink for under $14 and still leave satisfied. Sometimes good prices makes food just taste that much better.
5	All my favorites have gone away. Anna's Garden. Noodle Palace! Then the girlfriend took me to this place. Wow. It reminds me of Big Wong's in NYC that we went to when we were slepping around from Boston to NYC.The place is in a crappy shopping center but the food is great. It's cheap and good. The restrooms are clean as heck. The staff very friendly. No, you white folks, no need to worry about rude asian servers here. Yes, I get them too. I hate when they throw my food at me. I intend to try every dish that they have. Took my coworkers here and they loved it too. So maybe they will help with the business. I hate to see another good place go down the tubes in this economy.So what do they serve besides a friendly, non-pretentious atmosphere? Well for starters, the walls do have a lot of stuff on them, menu items, like a lot of other Chinese restaurants. But wait! They are written in English unlike the ones that will remain nameless here, Anna's Garden, Noodle Palace, KJ's Kitchen. Oh the waitress speaks great English too btw. My Chinese is bad so I'll keep a lid on it.My friend really liked their pancake and curry chicken (roti pancake). It's more like nan bread then a waffle or whatever pancakes are made of. I hate pancakes so I cannot relate.I have had their wonton without the noodles and it's really good. I think all their noodle dishes are good and tasty. Most items are less than $5 so you might was well eat here versus spending it on a Big Mac. Spend it on a Big Wong instead.
4	The crispy, juicy fried chicken that I ordered was perfection! It took quite a bit of a wait and I was super hungry at the time, but once I got my food I forgot all about the hunger and just dove in. The service was great. I happen to visit on a busy day (even though it was around 2pm) but there was no problem tending to my needs. I also ordered their chicken wings to go. Their almond pudding with lychee was a refreshing break from the oily food I just consumed. I don't know if they changed the minimum amount of $10 for those paying with a card, but I honestly find it inconvenient for me since I never carry cash and use my debit to pay for everything. So I was somewhat "forced" to order more that I wanted. *shrugs* I guess I shouldn't be surprised since most places have that $10 minimum =/Other than that, this place is great. Everything was affordable, which is a good thing for a college student like myself.
3	The price will probably be the reason that you will be willing to try this place, probably like so many lost souls that have sauntered away from the Monta-Mania you will stumble upon this establishment and a few others that have sprouted around the Monta Phenomenon. The first thing that will catch your attention will be the price, with each dish averaging around $5(tax is already incorporated in the price) you are probably asking yourself...is this a Kid's meal? Will the food be good? What the heck, all I've got to lose is 5 bucks...so why am I hesitant to give it a try? & tried we did (Monta was packed & the wait was long & i was hungry!) The Star of our dinner was definitely the fried chicken, definitely worth the 18 minute wait! The beef ramen was ok, the fried pork chop was ok, would've been better if it was golden brown & not pale, I loved the plain udon soup, salt & pepper shrimp ok, Mango pudding ok...roti with chicken curry ok...in short, this place is AVERAGE, not super great but not bad at all as well. It is a retry decent meal considering the price. I would probably come back here, but as far as craving it, not really. This would be PERFECT though to have blind dates because what if "You are just not that into her/him?" at least you did not spend that much! (be sure to bring your own set of utensils though and your own glass!) they only have plastic spoons & forks etc.  and styropore cups???? Tsk, Tsk, Tsk... hey beggars can't be choosers!
4	Must have their chicken wings!  And the salt & pepper shrimp are yummy.  I'm looking forward to the pork chops next time...
4	I love this place! Food is good, service is good and prices are.... gooder! I always get the shrimp wonton soup, the salt and pepper shrimp, and the steamed fish. All that for less than twenty bucks. The only problem is that they use plastic utensils and serve the tea in styrofoam cups, (kind of hard to keep my pinky up) it reminds me that I'm not paying enough, but other than that, nothings Wong with Big, Next time you're in the neighborhood make sure to stop by and try this place. You probably have enough to eat here with the change under the seat of your car, just don't look for it while you're driving......hospital food is not as good.
4	great food, great price....just takes a while to wait for service....
5	First time tried out this place after it's been a very long time since my friends told me about it. This restaurant is very small and simple but the food was so good and the price was better like $4.95/dish included tax already! Everyone was very nice. I'll definitely be back soon.
5	Another Yelp home run! I read about Big Wong at work yesterday and just had to last night. I got home and the better-half was talkin' spaghetti and all I was thinking was Big Wong....... A guy has to be careful how he says that, doesn't he?So I told my wife about this great little place I had read about on yelp and she jumped right on the Big Wong band wagon.Great food! Great Service! Great price! The chicken curry with roti (mine) was incredible. The wife got the ribeye special which she enjoyed, but she enjoyed my curry even more. She went with the ribeye because the simplicity (Not a bad thing.) of the menu kinda intimidated her. We're used to fried rice, sweet and sour pork and chow mien on the menus where we normally eat. None of that at Big Wong. We also got the salt and pepper wings(Yum!) and an order of fried shrimp wontons(Yum Yum!). At 5 duckets for the wontons you are easily talking about the best app in Las Vegas.We finished off with a mango pudding and a sweet roti. I wouldn't do the pudding again, but wow was that roti a treat.The question is not whether I will go back but when will I go back. That the restaurant sits in between our home and where my son goes to high school, I can envision attaining "regular" status.
3	What a disappointment!  With all the great things said about this place by people's whose reviews I respect, I thought it would be better than it was.  I just barely give 3 stars.  I was contemplating two and a half.I was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.  The curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.As I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.I was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.After waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.I don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.  And as for dessert, I drove up Spring Mountain Road and stopped at McDonald's and had a McFlurry!  Better than her pudding I'd be willing to wager even sight unseen!
4	Not your usual Americanized Chinese food. Very good, authentic, Asian food.
4	Folks, Big Wong is now batting 4th in this line up.$4.95 OUT THE DOOR for their chicken and rice that is literally enough for 2 meals and is all cooked healthy, LOCK that sh*t up!This is a masterpiece of a Restaurant. Food is always out quick. The employees are nice and speak good English. One lady actually had an east coast/Asian accent which I found just awesome.I had some pita bread thing with curry sauce that was great.FREE hot tea the entire experience.I thought I was going to get some garbage food for a cute little hangover; NOPE.I couldn't believe the price for such lean good food. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was a bad odor in the joint. It could have been the area but I', not sure, just being safe with my rating.
5	My husband generally doesn't like much Asian food, but he will actually ASK to go here.  We've been here at least a 1/2 dozen times in the last 8 months and are always very happy with the food quality and service.  Best dishes are by far the Chicken Curry with Roti, Rib eye over noodles, and the fried pork with rice.  The beef ramen (with cartilage/tendons) is gelatinous and delicious as well.  The meat is always tender and the sauces are light but flavorful.We were there the day the chef came up with the Sweetened Roti and we have to get it every time.  It's amazing.  We ate there last night, but I want to go back now just writing about it...
5	Visited this place in March when vacation in Las Vegas!  Wow what a surprise?  I was a little concerned when the hainan chicken is only priced at $4.95!  What can they offer you for this price?  Everything is at least double the price here in San Francisco!  And they even have choice of white meat, dark meat with & without bones.  I struggled a bit & still decide to order the hainan chicken.  My husband ordered curry! We were both surprised & satisfied!  The hainan chicken's "rice" is really good & yummy too!  The meal portion is big.  Never expected, and price & taste way exceed our expectation!  Already told all my friends who travel to LV that this is a must visit restaurant.  For my 4 days visit in March, I visited this place twice!  And the service here was excellent too!
2	So I originally wanted to go to the ramen place in the same plaza, but the wait was so atrociously long we decided to just hit up Big Wong. Did a quick yelping and saw that the beef ramen was supposed to be good and since I was already in the fixing for ramen anyways I decided to give it a shot.It was at best...mediocre. The broth had an average taste with nothing unique about it, however, the beef was very fatty and not enjoyable to eat. Next time I will definately choose to wait for the other ramen joint rather than be impatient.
5	I loved this place!Its ironic because its right next to Roku, a highly rated Japanese restaurant where I was at a few weeks ago. The bill being more than $100 at Roku, the bill was 23 dollars tonight at Big Wong, and I would have preferred this meal if they were the same price.I got the Beef Ramen, the Chicken Curry and Roti, Salt and Pepper Pork, and Hai Nan Chicken. The Beef Ramen was really tasty and I would recommend it, especially being only 6 dollars. The Chicken Curry and Roti was really good, even though there wasn't a lot of curry. The Hai Nan chicken was also pretty good, and the Salt and Pepper Pork was just average, but for 23 dollars for the whole thing, it was extremely worth it.The service was good. Our waitress was very friendly. However, I came an hour before closing time so there was only 3 parties total, on a Saturday night.In short, establishments like this is why I love Yelp. It helps you discover family-owned holes in the wall where great tasting food at low costs are possible.
4	My brother was in town and wanted to get a quick lunch before I had to go into work. Wanted to go into Monta but it was 11 and they weren't open yet, so we stopped in at the Big Wong.Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned.
5	This has to be on every list for best cheap eats!Fast friendly service.  Nice and clean.  This place serves Chinese and Malaysian cuisine.  They have a simple menu with super cheap prices.  Noodle and rice with different entrees.  I tell you what I really appreciated, was the fact that the waitress was able to help me understand the menu.  Usually, when I go to an asian restaurant for the first time I am mostly confused and the waitress usually can't help you.  I was super hungry and  I asked if these were full size dishes because the prices were so cheap.  She explained everything.  She sold me on a house special.The dish had rice, a side of something like spinach, Chinese sausage and a bowl of chicken and shitake mushrooms.  This was a house special for $5.95 and it was a hearty meal.  The chicken was silky tender in a nice broth.  The broth was a little fatty which some people may not like, but I like it. It was real simple and homemade tasting.  If you consider value and the quality of the food this place is amazing.  I would go back fo sho.
4	Solid place for a bite and value for dollar to boot. Clean place and attentive staff though a bit stretched if crowded.I had the beef ramen and pepper chicken wings. What the ramen is not - authentic ramen preparation as found at Monta nor a complex stock as one expects from a Pho. What it is - a beefy broth with ramen noodles cooked to a nice al dente with lots of beef chunks (brisket type cubes.) While a great deal for the money my personal preference would be towards less beef and a softer cut - but I dare not ding them on my "opinion."The wings were a real surprise. Thin crispy skin and juicy meat inside with a gentle heat that builds. A nice change from sauce laden buffalo wings.In all a filling meal of fresh ingredients for about $10-11.
4	There is a difference between cheap food and good cheap food.  This is good cheap food in fact pretty great cheap food.  I can come here and we can get a meal with drinks and get out for under $20 with leftovers and stuffed!I have tried a few things but love the Hainan Chicken (boiled chicken) with dipping sauce (sauce is a spicy chili and sriracha and a more mellow soy based sauce) and rice.  The rice they must add a broth or something to it because seriously I could just eat the rice it is that good!  The boiled chicken is healthy I just skip the skin.  We like to get the On Choy (a water spinach) with fermented bean curd (you can get it without the bean curd as well) very flavorful and good!  I have also had the wonton soup the pork udon soup and a few other things, however I keep coming back for the chicken.  My boyfriend says it is a comfort food for him and reminds him of growing up.  I don't think I could buy all the ingredients needed to make this for that cheap!  The place is clean the staff is nice I believe it is family owned so they don't have a full staff so sometimes the service is slow but I don't mind that because I know it is a small business.  It is always clean and orderly. I always leave happy and full with money left in my pockets so I am a happy girl...
5	i still come here either once or twice every 2 weeks.  you just cant beat the taste and price! im still a big fan of their curry chicken and beef ramen.  I havent found another chinese place like their beef ramen!I do notice that they do put up new items every now and then.  I havent gotten a chance to try them all.
4	Delicious. The shrimp wonton soup and salt & pepper fried wings are must eats!
4	Cheap good food. When you don't want the hassle of paying high prices at the strip... Great place to visit for FAST GOOD food when all you want to do is eat and then go straight to sleep after a crazy night out on the strip or working all day at the expo.. ..Try the Soy sauce chicken*, Hainan Chicken w rice *, Beef Curry with roti, & beef ramen (decent)...
4	Just got back from Vegas, had the Curry Beef (they were out of chicken), Fried Porkchop Udon, Fried Chicken Udon, Fried Shrimp wonton as well as Shrimp Wonton in udon, desert we tried the Mango, almond and Roti (flaming Ice cream). This place had a strange smell when you enter, but got used to when you are in. The food was good and decent, it had a Japanese/chinese/hawaiian taste to it.. I know Udon is Japanes, but all of these other flavors confuses yet heighten your senses.  Overall it was food, a family of four cost around $40 and you were stuffed when you leave.. get in their early as they ran out of favorites fast.. the hamione Rice and chicken curry ran out when we arrived around 7pm
5	We originally found this place on yelp and now we eat there as often as we can.I could write a long legnthy review but it really comes down to this,The food is great, the prices are great and the service is great.We have eaten at many places in Vegas but this is by far our favorite.They make the best Saly & Pepper Pork Chops, the best Salt & pepper Wings both go great with the seasoned rice and topped off with their Roti Pancake.The people who run it are some of the nicest people in Vegas.
4	My GF and I ordered the shrimp wanton soup, beef curry over rice, and the #1 (i don't remember exactly what it was called but it had chicken with 2 sauces with rice) for ~18.- The price of a McDonald's value meal, maybe less! Real cheap! around 5 bucks each. Good portion too! - A taste you can't complain about! kinda...haha     - The soup comes with 8 wantons, which we ordered. If you opted for the noodles, then you get only 5. Needs more soup to compensate for all that wanton.      - The beef curry was my favorite. I highly recommend it! The beef is very tender. The waiter told me they bake it for 7-9 hours! Comes with lots of curry, so i needed more rice.     - The #1 was alright. I loved the hot sauce, which was not too hot, but use it with the beef curry and it will be very satisfying.- Great service! Maybe bc we were the only ones there, but the waitress and chef talked to us and gave recommendations. They even left the water container on the table for us :)!!!^____^!
3	Ok, so...I gave it a second try before writing this review.  I would say that for the beef ramen...I love the noodles that they use it is really good.  Not much broth flavor but you can doctor it up with the condiments if they had the right kind...may be they will get some like what pho restaurants offers.  The beef is tasty and they will ask if you want tendons or not...cool...Hainan chicken w rice...it was decent, sauce could be better.  Of course I am judging this with my experience from eating this famous dish in Thailand.  I will come here for this dish bc again I will not make it at home due to too much work, and I like that you can ask for white meat w/o extra charge.  I had Ong choy vegetables this was decent too.  Then we ended with sweet roti, it was ok.  2nd visit...Good wonton soup, I would get this again.  Fish ball curry, well I guess I don't like Malaysian style curry I won't get any curry dishes since Malay is the base for their curry. Chicken wings, umm...really salty and not any other flavor...I want to like this place.  The restuarant is really, really clean.  I think the lady owner has OCD in a good way, she spays and clean table right after customers leave...a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  They are really nice and courteous and the cook is constantly asking me what he can do to make this place better.  I told him the price is right so far, they will have more business if they can improve the flavor of the food.  Nevertheless, if you are hungry and want something fast to eat and not Mcdonald's...it's an alternative:)
5	This hidden gem rocks. We had the salt and pepper pork,  the beef ramen and the won-ton shrimp. All three were spectacular. The bill was under $20 which put a huge smile on my face. The server was busy but still found time to explain their dishes to us newbs.I will def be back.
4	Good food Good service Good priceCan't go wrong with that
4	I have to figure that a lot people, like me, end up here because of lines at Monta and Raku.  Both great.  Big Wong makes it a trifecta and makes the center the best food shopping center in Chinatown.  The house special soup with udon is so addicting I went back twice in 3 days.
4	This place is so much more than just a funny name. Some unique dishes and flavors and at cheap, cheap prices. Almost all of their dishes are around the $5 mark. Ordered the #5 Special Deep Fried Chicken over Rice (Boneless) and the #12 House Special Shrimp Wonton Soup. The #5 was really good and I would definitely get again. The soup was not to my taste, it wasn't bad, just not something I would get again.Service was very friendly, menu is simple and the place was very clean when I went to pick up my food.Will have to go back sometime to try more dishes!
4	I have to say...so far THE best Hainan Chicken Rice I've ever eaten in the States!! Very authentic flavor!! Also reconmmend fish ball and shrimp wonton soup :)
5	I'll admit I'm biased since I'm walking distance to Seoul Plaza where this restaurant is located.5-stars because the food's good with a wide variety of Chinese dishes, the prices cheap, the service friendly, and place clean (dining room, kitchen which is visible to diners, men's bathroom but I can't attest to the women's bathroom cleanliness).
5	This place never disappoints me. I love their food, it's simple and tasty. I came here with my siblings and our boyfriends. The waitress/co-worker sat us down. She gave us the menu and asked what we wanted to drink. I was craving some shrimp and I was debating whether I should get fried shrimp wonton or house special shrimp wonton soup in the end, I decided to get the fried shrimp wonton. The fried shrimp wonton comes with one big shrimp in each of the wonton wrapper. It was so delicious and had a lot of flavors. The serving was big, it comes with 10 pieces. I got to try some of the other food they serve in their menu. I had to taste the other shrimp-- house special shrimp wonton soup. The broth is tasty and not too salty. The wonton also has one big piece of shrimp in it. I also tried the curry beef over rice, it's very spicy but I can still tolerate it. The beef is tender and juicy. The curry has a lot of flavor, it taste different from what I had before but it's very good.  How can I forget about the sweetened roti, this is one of my favorite dessert since I tried this. Roti is an Indian flat bread that is bake like a pizza, they put condense milk and powdered sugar on top of the flat bread. Yes, it's unhealthy but I don't usually order desert whenever I dine in to a restaurant.Yes, I'm in love with this place.
5	I think I am addicted to Big Wong.  After moving to Vegas I was initially turned off by the silly name.  I didn't think that a restaurant named Big Wong would serve good food.  Boy was I wrong.  My friends went here and told me that the food was legit and the prices were amazing.  After finally giving it a taste, I came back 3 days in a row.  Getting full off of a $5 meal?!?  ADDICTED!Here are the dishes I tried:1.  Thin rib eye over rice $4.95 - Thinly sliced rib eye is served with yummy dipping sauce.  The rice comes on a separate plate and comes with some steamed potato slices.  A great deal for rib eye!2.  Steamed chicken, mushrooms, chinese sausage, and vegetables $5.95 - There are a lot of components to this dish that kept me from getting bored.  The chicken is served in a bowl of broth separately from the sausage, rice, and veggies.  Pour it over your rice to get some soupy chicken rice.  Gotta love the lop chong (spelling?) - 5th generation Chinese, I apologize.3.  Hoi nam chicken (dark meat, boneless) $4.95 - Excellent!  Soft steamed chicken without any bones.  Comes with the yummy flavored rice and 2 dipping sauces.  A soy based sauce and a red spicy one.  4.  Salt and pepper chicken wings $4.95 - I love the saltiness of this one.  Tiny jalepenos are sprinkled on top as well.  Great appetizer to share with the group.5.  Salt and pepper pork $4.95 - Thin slices of pork deep fried and then sliced.  Very similar to the salt and pepper wings but a little less salty.  I prefer the chicken wings.6.  Beef ramen $5.95 - Ok.  Cantonese style beef ramen with all the tendon and chunks that you can ask for.  Not my thang personally.7.  Mango pudding $1.25 - So good!  A great way to end your super cheap meal, with a super cheap dessert!  Chunks of mango are actually in the cup too :D8.  Sweet roti $1.25? - A thin roti or bread thingy with condensed milk, powdered sugar, and other sweet goodness on top.  Gotta try it at least once.Other random tid-bits:They always give you extra scallions in a metal tin.Easy parking.Cheap everything.  Tax is included in the price on the menu!Mom and pop store.  The wife is the server and her husband is the chef.  He wears a giant chef hat too!Definitely recommend to anyone who is in Vegas in search of some good cheap food!  Cheaper than Earl of Sandwich haha.
4	Second time and Big Wong did not disappoint! my family tried the shrimp wonton with egg noodles, udon and Shrimp soup.  All were flavorful and excellent.This time we had lunch so the chicken hamione Rice was avail and it was so good!!! THe only reason for not a full 5 stars.. we had the friend chicken wings and though they were good, they were way too salty... really really salty
5	Found this place on Yelp while in the Chinatown area.  Believe all the reviews and all the hype.  This place is the bomb.  Super cheap food and super great flavor.  I had the salt and pepper pork and some shrimp wontons.  The wontons were really light and crispy and ALL SHRIMP.  No Filler.  The pork was cooked to perfection and has the perfect amount of spice.  The guy next to me was eating the special shrimp wonton noodle soup which looked amazing.  I'm going to try that next time I go to Big Wong which will hopefully be soon!
5	I love love love Big Wong! This is hands down the best budget bite place in Vegas.How can you go wrong with legit Hoi nam chicken for $4.95? You even get a choice of dark/white meat either boneless or not. Common, with all the high prices in vegas, this place definitely saves your wallet. The dish is served with season rice, spicy dipping sauce, soy sauce, and ginger (upon request). For an additional $0.75 you can get a nice steaming bowl of broth to go along with your meal. All this for under $6!This sure beats out the $10+ meal i shell out for Pho at Pho Kim Long down the street. Can't wait to come back to try the other dishes.
5	On a Tuesday night, we ordered the salt and pepper pork, chicken curry over rice, rotti pancake, and almond pudding for 15.90.- NO WONG!? FYI, it means good business or being prosperous. "big wong" is actually MISTA LEE. lol. good people :)- Smells like raw eggs upon entering. goes away tho. you adapt the asian smell.- No bone! easy eats for shovelers. pork chop cut in small pieces. - Chicken curry was great. comes with chopped potatoes. Not golden curry brand. where the carrots at tho?- pancake tasted like a crepe! crispy! sweet! delicious! must get! 1.25! the price of a gum. BIG JUICE! probably less!- Almond pudding was also a hit. 3 lychees tho. not bad.- service is a bit slow. waterless for awhile. i get thirsty -___-. where my pork chop?- Ms Lee takes pictures!- So cheap! AYCE got nothin on this
4	Really enjoyed going here after my boyfriend recommended that we go there. Super friendly staff, delicious and cheap food. Everything we tried was amazing. You gotta try it out if for nothing else- its got a great name!!
5	I think I'm going to get here once a week.  I'm saying it now, the shrimp wontons are the best food deal in town.  A trendy food truck might charge a buck a piece but here at Big Wongs you get a plate full for 5 bucks.  I'm writing the update because of how friendly the owner is.  We had my girlfriend's son with us and he made sure to get the kid some chicken he would like and recommended us to try some very good things.  The shrimp wonton udon and beef curry were awesome.  We left, bellies full for around 20 bucks.  See ya soon Big Wong's!
4	After an exhausting weekend of alcoholic sins and gluttonous,late-night dining, my friends and I were looking for a simple, wallet-friendly meal before heading home.  Thanks to our trusty Yelp app, we fond Big Wong's and was impressed by the # of positive reviews for a place that has seemingly RIDICULOUSLY low prices!  I'm from the San Gabriel area so I'm accustomed to cheap food, but Big Wong's pricing is almost TGTBT and makes you question what ingredients they use....However, 3 days after my meal, I have survived w/o any gastrointestinal isues and in fact, feel pretty good (thanks to my cheap meal @ Big Wong's!)As for the venue itself, it is located in the heart of the Las Vegas "Chinatown" (but feels more like Westminster) area and is within a smal strip mall with numerous other asian-based restaurants and businesses (foot massage anyone?)  Once you enter Big Wong, you'll see a traditionally simple restaurant, clean, bare, and most likely somewhat empty.  However don't be offput by the lack of lines like at Marquee or XS, this is a good thing :)The menu options are actually quite expansive, and include many many recognizable (and comfortable when you're tired/hungover) items.  I had the "thin ribeye with rice" dish that was okay in taste; a bit lean on the meat, heavy on the white rice, but my standard were so freaking low that I was still happy.  The sauce it comes with is a bit bland....so I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you are really looking to eat light.  My companions tried the Hainan chicken, which was average..but my standards are based on Savoy's kitchen which has the best Hainan Chicken known to my existanec.  My other friend had a pho-like noodle dish that he said tasted good and it was pretty sizeable.  Finally, we all shared a portion of crispy chicken wings which I actually enjoyed! Not too oily or greasy, nice and flavorful with unidentifiable spices/seasonings.  Every single item we ordered was $4.95 which INCLUDES TAX!!! OMFG deal of the century in las vegas (even better than the $6.99 steak and eggs @ Bills).  Total cost after tip$23VIVA LAS VEGAS AS AN ASIAN!!
4	It pains me to take away one star from this place, because I loved it so much the first 4 or 5 times. But this last visit was the reason.The lady who works there was ALWAYS friendly to me. In fact, I remember her being warm and jovial. However, the last time we went, it was like she did a 180 and was a totally different person. She was curt, short, awkward, and borderline rude. In fact, I totally agree with Steven P's review of how she acted. If it wasn't for the first few times, I would probably also give a lower rating, perhaps 2 stars, based on this last interaction. But with my past experiences, and the fact that I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, I took away only one star with the intention to go back again. However, if service was anything like the last time, I would probably pick another spot in Chinatown to eat from now on.To be continued...
5	**** TRY IT ALL ****I have been here a dozen times (or more) and everything I have had has been great.My Favorites, so far.......Fried pork chop soup w/ udonChicken CurryFish Ball SoupHoi Nam Chicken w/ special seasoned riceSalt & Pepper WingsChicken w/ Mushroom and SausageBeef RamenMango PuddingThe restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the prices are amazing!
3	The Hainanese chicken was ok, but I'm very biased because I had REALLY good Hainanese chicken in Canada.  Wasn't too impressed with the soy sauce chicken.  The salt and pepper chicken wings were really good! That's what pulled it to 3 stars along with the lady taking my order was super nice!
5	Beef ramen, 6 bucks! Beef ramen, 6 clams! Beef ramen, seis dolares!  No matter how you say it, that's a great bowl of noodles with yummy broth and tender, juicy chunks of beef.  And don't be afraid of the tendons!Big Wong kills again!
3	Decent cheap Chinese food. Everything is on the greasy side as they use lots of MSG.
5	This place is a bit of a hole in the wall, but well worth the visit.  Most everything on the menu is $4.95, including tax.  In my three visits here, I have tried the beef ramen, beef curry, chicken wings, salt and pepper pork chops, garlic chinese broccoli, mango pudding and almond pudding.  All were pretty good with the stand outs being the chicken wings and the almond pudding.  The chicken wings were crispy without being breaded and nicely spicy since it is served with hot peppers.  The almond pudding takes me back to growing up in Hawaii.  Overall, the decor and ambiance would normally get a deduction of a point from me, but the LOW prices get extra credit earning the star back.
4	Very good..I loved the roti pancakes, the curry chicken and the lemon tea..It was amazing! Quiet little piece of Chinatown..
3	I finally got to try this place after having it bookmarked for forever. My husband and I wanted some cheap eats but didn't want standard fast food. Big Wong fit the bill.When I saw the prices on the menu, I had to blink a few times to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. I ordered the Special Shrimp Wonton with Udon Soup and my husband got the Curry Chicken.  The waitress recommended the Salt and Pepper Chicken for an appetizer so we agreed. The food came out super fast. My husband enjoyed the Curry Chicken and had some leftover to take home. My soup was good. I enjoyed the seafood-y broth. I found some shrimp poop in a few of my shrimp so that was a little turn off. I just scraped it out and continued eating. The Salt and Pepper Chicken was also good but not the best I've had.I gave this place 3 stars because the food was solid and good portioned. The waitress was a little short. When I asked if they had dungeness crab, she simply said no and walked away while I still had another question. I'm used to that type of service in Chinatown so that didn't bother me much. This place is good for cheap eats and satisfying your hunger but I don't think I'll be craving it much.
4	Oh wow!  Another gem I would never have thought to try had it not been for Yelp!Great Asian food for - get this - $4 to $6 for pretty much everything on the menu.  I love me a smoking deal on great food.  We came here and got a smorgasbord of items because the prices allowed us to try so much:- Chicken curry with Roti pancakes...my FAVORITE.  The curry was so flavorful and the Roti pancakes are my new obsession.- Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings...my second favorite.  Really salty, but in a good way.- Salt and Pepper Pork Ribs...not so great.  Really salty, but in a bad way.- Steamed chicken with mushrooms and sausage.  Oh my goodness, the mushrooms in this were to die for.  The broth had really good flavor, and the chicken was so tender.I also have to give some big props to our waitress.  She knew the menu extensively and even suggested we change some items in our order to avoid getting too much rice (hence the Roti pancakes).Big Wong is Big Awesome.
5	Their prices are hard to beat (usually around the $4-8 range) and I like to come here to order food home from work :0).What I usually like to ORDER:(don't mind me; I love anything salt & pepper)Salt & Pepper Pork ChopsSalt & Pepper Chicken WingsCurry w/ 3 Roti PancakesSweetened Roti Pancake $1 eachThey have a lot of menu items posted on their walls, too. If you like them, I'd say come back a few times just to try their whole menu and see what you like best. They'll easily provide you with suggestions depending on what you're looking for.
5	The value is incredible. Big Wong delivers fresh, small portions that are priced right. I'm a huge fan of eating a lot of small dishes, so this was right up my alley. My wife and I shared the Beef Curry, Fried Pork Chop, Shrimp Won Tons, and Chinese Broccoli (sauteed Thai-style as per our waiter Paul's recommendation).Speaking of Paul, he provided incredibly personalized service. His recommendations, friendliness, and attentiveness were top-notch. He refilled our hot tea (no charge, by the way) over and over again. I left this place feeling both frugal and fulfilled.
4	Great food at great value!!! Don't be fooled by the price. Service is what you would expect at most Chinese spots: friendly but inattentive. Seafood Udon - The dish looks simple but full of flavor. It was both sweet and savory. True seafood flavor. Chicken Rice - It was good but did not leave an impression. I guess I had this dish at too many other places that it is hard to stand out. Some food critics came in and just had the chicken wings. Gotto try that next time!
5	I come here a lot for chinese food. The owner is very friendly and will provide any suggestions, but everything on their menus is good! And the prices are very decent. I've tried majority of the menu, but I find myself almost always ordering the same thing these days, which is the deep fried chicken over rice. I haven't had anything bad to date. I will get the Shrimp Won Tons, sauteed veggies Thai style, deep friend chicken over rice, and sweetened roti pancakes, but take most of it home. I like their almond and mango pudding, but the mango is really sweet compared to their almond, which is expected, but be warned if you can't handle super sweet, stay away from the mango and go with the almond! The Sweetened Roti pancake is another good choice! It's only $1 while the pudding are $1.25 each. Basically would recommend anything and everything on the menu! As the prices are pretty cheap too, don't be afraid to make this a regular spot!
5	HOHO! Finally! I have found myself a little gem of a restaurant. Big Wong's is so cheap yet so delicious! My favorite dish thus far would have to be curry chicken. The curry has just a tiny bit of heat, and the chicken literally just falls apart (in the good way). Another favorite of my would be the fried pork chop rice, because it comes with this awesome awesome dipping sauce which tastes kinda like porky gravy. A great dessert item is the sweetened roti pancake which is only a dollar! (!!) It's a roti pancake covered in condensed milk and powered sugar ( along with rainbows and sunshine and all things delicious)
3	I tried the Salt N Pepper shrimp and was slightly fooled by the photos. I assumed the shrimp were peeled and that it was more of a battered shrimp. They were lightly battered with shells and half the shrimp were barely deveined. The peeling was to difficult so I just ate the shrimp less the tale. Needless to say I wasn't too impressed with the shrimp. I also ordered some of the Beef Ramen it tasted somewhat buttery with an after taste of what I can only describe as Vaseline intense care hand lotion. I know that sounds weird but I could barely eat it with the after taste it left me. The Curry Chicken Roti was probably my favorite thing that I ordered. Hot and flavorful! The staff here is wonderful and very courteous
5	Best of Asia, all in one restaurant.The wifey, sister-in-law, and I came here during our last Vegas trip. We wanted to get away from the strip and eat some good and cheap food. This place really hit the spot. We ordered the Chicken Wings, House Seafood Noodle Soup, Curry w/ Roku, and Han-Nan Chicken. All I can say is damn. The Chicken Wings were freshly fried, hot and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Well seasoned and packed with a lot of flavor. The house seafood soup was a very generous portion - loaded with fish, crab meat, tempura/oden/fish balls. Great chewy consistency on the noodles and served in a light seafood broth. The curry was tasty, loaded with spices, but I think the large chunks of potatoes took away from the meal. The Roku pancakes it was served with was a delicious dipping tool. Lastly, and probably my favorite, was the Han-Nan Chicken. Tender cuts of steamed chicken served with two dipping sauce and accompanied by the most tasty chicken broth rice I've ever had. The best part of this place is our total for 3 entrees and a side came out to be 18 dollars total. I will be back!A little about my credentials:I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.
5	Cheap and delicious food for the poor college student. My boyfriend and I come here every so often and order the same appetizer, entree and dessert every single time. Appetizer: 10 piece fried shrimp wontons. These are quite addicting. Just like how you open up a box of Pringles or start munching on some microwavable popcorn and you cant stop? Yeah, that addicting. Each simple wonton has a huge piece of shrimp and are perfectly fried, accompanied by sweet and sour sauce.   Entree: Just when we're about to order more shrimp wontons, our Thin Rib-eye over Pasta is sent to our table. For $4.95, this dish is absolute heaven, both for our bellies and our wallet. They don't skimp out on the meat and comes with a side of steamed potatoes. We like to pour the brown sauce (some type of beef broth thing) all over the plate to tie the rib-eye, pasta and potatoes together.  Dessert: Sweet roti drizzled in condensed milk is the way to go! My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so I end up eating most of this myself. The almond pudding is also divine. So refreshing - it's the perfect end note to the meal. You can't go wrong with these two items for a grand total of $2.25. This place is located in a small strip mall with minimal decor and menu items handwritten on neon poster boards all over their walls. Don't judge a book by its cover, though. The food is seriously amazing for what you pay for. Oh yeah, if you end up ordering to-go or box up your leftovers, their to-go boxes are top notch and reusable. Fancy plastic to use again and again!
2	Got the Shrimp wonton w/ramen noodle. The portion was very good but, the soup has absolutely no flavor.  Disappointed as all the reviews said it was great.
5	Also Great:Fried Chicken SoupBeef Curry w/RiceSteamed/Poached Fish w/Rice & Veggie
2	If you are looking for cheap, fast food this place is for you. If you are looking for friendly, attentive service you need to look else where. I've been here three times, since I generally go by the three strikes rule. Each time the food was consistently good, not delicious,  just good. As for service, you order and get your initial drink and you are quickly forgotten about. The waitress,  each time there has been one or two, always seemed stressed. I felt as if I  inconvenienced her by coming in and dare be a customer. Not matter if this place has good food at reasonable prices, I would never go back and be treated poorly for giving them my business.
5	It was excellent I have the special shrimp Ramen bowl. I really enjoyed especially since I have a sore throat now I feel full better and happy!
5	Great Chinese food!  It's like I went over to my uncles house and he cooked for me.  That is how amazing the food is here at Big wongs.  The street Beef noodles are great.  The beefy broth with the melt in your mouth meat is delicious.  Just the right hint of beef flavor, star anis and other great ingredients.  The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.  The rice was not too greasy and it had the right hint of ginger and chicken.  Fabulous!  Dip it in their 2 dipping sauces, and you have perfection on a plate.  The garlic braised chinese broccoli on sizzling plate was great also.  Cooked to perfection where it was crunchy and notes of garlic with each bite.  The chinese pancake (both savory and sweet) were both delicious.  Just the right amount of crunch without being too burnt.Get this, the amazing part with all the food we ordered, it was under $20!!!  Great food at amazing prices.  How can you beat that?
5	Big Wong is located on Spring Mountain Rd. in the same shopping center as top competitors such as Monta and Raku. At first, I was hesitant to dine there because I thought it was going to be the same as most other Chinese restaurants. It took me several times passing by until I finally gave it a try and now, I dine there almost every week! (no joke!)This place is AMAZING!Granted, upon walking in, the establishment is not as nicely decorated as most other restaurants. BUT DON'T LET THE LACK OF INTERIOR DESIGN FOOL YOU!  The food here is delicious and the cheapest in town (NO TAX ! ) I always order their fried shrimp wonton ($4.95 .. 10-12 pieces) The wontons are served with sweet chili sauce. What makes them so good is the whole shrimp that is stuffed inside. They are also super, super crispy and delicious as appetizers.I also suggest getting their beef ramen, or wonton soup. ($5.95) .. The broth they make is very sweet and flavorful. It isn't bland like other places. The portions they give you is also very considerate.I also love their sizzling garlic sauteed vegetables. (only $6.95) They serve it on an iron plate that they bring out to you smoking and sizzling. Every time someone orders it, the whole restaurant smells like garlic! It is so delicious and perfect to eat with rice! You can also order it with thai chili which adds an amazing spice. The blend of garlic and chili is absolutely perfect.The last thing I would definitely recommend is their Authentic Hai Nam Chicken. The rice that is served is cooked in chicken broth so you get the full flavor of chicken in every bite. The chicken itself (cut in pieces, either dark or white meat) is steamed in ginger and garlic. I love this plate! The aroma of the marinated chicken is so flavorful in your mouth. You get two different types of dipping sauce with the dish. A semi sweet soy sauce and an amazing semi sweet chili dipping sauce. Both of these sauces are great with the chicken!.. The portions are also very filling!As for desserts, I would recommend their sweet Rotti ($1) .. It is pretty much a crispy fried tortilla with condense milk and powdered sugar. I was super surprised how delicious these 3 combinations taste together!I It is very simple but very tasty!---The only con I would give to BW is that they don't have a very extensive drink/ dessert menu. Just be prepared for can sodas and about only 3 selections of desserts. However, the entree selections are plentiful. Overall, if you haven't tried BW yet, you are missing out! My girlfriends and I always overindulge ourselves when eating there and every time, our bill is under $25 (we always go with 3 or more ppl!)
4	Decide to give this place a try since the line outside Monta Ramen went crazy long and it was not all that anymore.The Chicken rice is alright, their porridge was good, big portion and tasted legit.The high light must be their beef ramen.  The soup is not as bold but since they put different type of spices in it, thats why it is not as bold taste as others but it is definitely good.  The ramen was a bit letdown since i wish they can use thicker noodle but for the price, I am not complainingTheir shrimp wonton is good!!  All shrimp wonton in a bowl for $4.95. Crazy.  I wish we have similiar quality wonton in LA but the last good one shut down years ago.I think if they can let me beef soup with wonton will be the best match but I don't think they will let me do that.  I will try next time when I go and will give an update.
4	Big Wong can get in this belly anytime.Their menu is simple, easy and cheap.After reading several reviews and seeing several of yelp friends visit this place, it was time for me to give this place a try. What I loved:The desert rotis.The plain rotis.The chicken curry.The shrimp wonton soup.What I liked:The salt and pepper chicken wings. The beef and tendon ramen.What can I say? Good, decent food at cheap prices. I will definitely be back time and time again. To go ordering is simple and so fast and painless.
4	A good place to go if you only want a snack or want to spend less than $10.00 on dinner.  All of the items are pretty standard with no frills.  Just a good, quick, cheap meal.
5	I am SO glad that we made the "fortunate mistake" of coming to Big Wong Restaurant! We came here because yelp listed this place under dim sum. This is NOT a dim sum restaurant where they serve the small tasting dishes like Asian tapas, but I'm SO glad I stayed.First, I'm NOT a fried won ton fan, because I can make them better than most Chinese restaurants. (True) BUT THIS PLACE makes won tons like they are SUPPOSED to be made! These are NOT the usual fried thick, greasy won ton wrappers full of over-seasoned fillers of minced indistinguishable shrimp mixed with egg white and minced bamboo shoots. Instead, THIN, delicate crisp wrappers, and the flavor of FRESH REAL plump chunks of shrimp are allowed to shine through in each bite. When you use fresh, quality shrimp, the flavor of the fresh shrimp is what shines through!I had the steamed chicken accompanied by gai lan (Chinese broccoli), lap cheong (slices of Chinese sausage) and steamed rice. The vegetables were perfectly crisp tender, the sausage was of good quality (meaning not fatty & salty), and fluffy steamed rice. The dish was a great balance of flavors with the delicately flavorful broth from the steamed chicken.The prices are cheap, and portions generous, but that does NOT mean this place skimps on quality! If you want Chinese food made with FRESH ingredients and not full of bloating MSG, come here! Even the tea is great: a slightly sweet jasmine tea!And you MUST MUST MUST finish your meal with the SWEET ROTI! (See my tip for more on the SWEET ROTI!)
4	Very cheap and nice food!
5	Big Wong is still my favorite Chinese lunch restaurant. The special shrimp noodle dish is always consistently great with the shrimp wontons and shrimpy based soup. I also like the fact they bring out the green onions, and hot sauce condiments so you can add more flavor to it as needed. The fresh diced green onions add a fresh flavor to the rich soup.Since their opening, they have added more menu items but I can't eat the special shrimp noodle soup and something else because their portions are more than enough for one person. Next time I will have to come back with a group so I can try their other items.
4	Fast and cheap tasty food. I like the chicken curry over rice for only 4.95!!  Also the mango pudding for dessert is delicious and only $1.25. I came here because Monta was a ridiculously long wait and it ended up being great.
5	I suppose now is as good a time as any to get my 400th review into the system.Big Wong is worthy of a milestone review, because everything here is amazing. It's affordable, delicious and clutch.I've been here a few times, but I'll share a little ditty about my first visit. I was in the mood for some soup, and was in the area. I had walked by once after a meal at Raku, so I figured I'd actually make the visit this time. Probably the funny nameI ordered the Shrimp Wonton soup. Steamed wontons in a very delicious broth. I was recovering from a cold, so this was very necessary. Everything was simply perfect, down to the addition of baby bok choy in the soup. The staff was very friendly, and because I was so enthusiastic about my meal, I ordered a second order to go. Each order is about five bucks.If you want to splurge, order the dessert roti. It's a mindblowing hand stretched roti sprinkled with powedered sugar and drizzled with honey.So, whatcha waiting for? Hit this place up.
5	I  highly recommend this place. Good food, good prices, and good service. Owners are very nice.  I recommend anything on the menu. My favorite item is the chicken curry with roti.
4	My friend and I came here after school for late dinner.  We had our minds set on eating and drinking but they don't serve alcohol.  The place was empty as it was already close to 10pm.They have Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Taiwanese dishes.  We got the chicken curry with roti, rib eye steak and beef ramen (the beef was so tender and broth had a good flavor).  They were good.  I really enjoyed the beef ramen.  We also got Thai iced tea which were in small 8oz styrofoam cups.  Everything about this place screams ASIAN!!!  The service, the cigarette smell coming from the kitchen and unpretentiousness.  The food was very cheap.  We only paid a bit over $20 for everything we got.  We were stuffed.I'll come back to try their other dishes.
5	It's great being here in Vegas and trying all types of food the strips and buffets has to offer. Then you try Chinatown food looking for a familiar setting you can find comfort in while being away from home, but all you find are high priced food ($8-14/dish) that the tastes good enough. Until you find Big Wong! This authentic restaurant screams, "feed my soul with your warm food."  You will find specials postered on their walls, a small joint that seems like only locals know about, to appreciate the scent of satay pan as you bite into your garlic infused ong choy, and enjoy the classic no b.s. attitude of the waitress ( which reminds me of ok service, but great food). No glitz, no glam kind of place. Just sit back, chill, and dine until it hit the spot! On average their price ~$4-6/item, can of pop $1, rice bowl $1. Can't beat that. They keep the menu short and serve quick. Waitress says, "we have a lil bit of everything, but we don't have everything." Meaning= Pan-Asian menu, no fried rice! Don't ask, you'll get yelled at. Hahaha...Everything was great! We ordered: salt n pepper chicken wings, wonton shrimp w udon noodle soup, satay garlic ong choy, good soy sauce. Cons: wooden chop sticks, plastic spoon
4	Dessert roti. NOMNOMNOM. I guess I better start off with what I did like. The salt and pepper chicken wings and the dessert roti's are total winners.We tried the chicken curry with roti cause I read soooo many reviews about it but unfortunately, nothing about it wowed me! :( We also tried the salt and pepper shrimp and I won't say it was horrible...but I was not impressed. Leaving the head and shell on was quite a deal breaker for me.The pro is that this place is more than affordable but unfortunately the lady/probably owner isn't that friendly. Another thing I found really weird was that they would use real plates, but give you plastic utensils, which is a strange concept to me. This place is really only 3.5 stars worthy but thinking about the dessert roti makes it 4.Here are the priceless reactions for the roti and chicken wingshttps://t.co/ISQtcRiSMUhttps://t.co/1xGG31eeTL
4	I cam here with Brad T., Alexis K. & her hubby came here one night to eat some good food.Brad T. and I never heard or been to Big Wong Restaurant so when we looked it up on Yelp we were surprised how great the ratings were here.  Anyways, we ordered about 7 dishes ( I believe ) and wow was everything I tasted was so good & the prices were so cheap! I wish I remembered what we ordered so I can recommend some dishes but I forgot them all.Ratings:Service (4)Food (5)Atmosphere (4)Easiness of paying (4) Overall (4) Great place, great good, and with great company!
1	The lady at this place is rude. she don't know how to greet customers with a smile. I will never go back there!!!!
5	Love this place. Amazing good food with super cheap price.
4	So I've been here a few times before and adored it. From the food to the wait staff to the cheapness TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE NO SHAME IN THEIR GAME AND THE KITCHEN DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THE PLACE. I just enjoy it.One broke Sunday I decide it's worth the drive to explore China town and end up taking the BF into BW.First of all, he loved his food. He had the Hoi Nam chicken.When the waitress brought it out she took one look at his giant-ginger self and explained to him how to eat it.Which he highly appreciated.I got the chicken curry and man they do it well. The flavor is deep and the meat is so tender it becomes a gravy for me to slather atop rice.We also split the shrimp appetizer can't fail there.When the bill came to 15 bucks I thought he was gonna faint.Good times.
2	the food was very bland. I'm asian and I typically like blander food, but this was even more bland for me.we ordered the #1 chicken (tasteless and dry white meat). this was served with rice and some sauces which weren't that good. the chicken was chopped up with no seasoning.the #15 beef ramen (this was okay but nothing special)and fried wonton (the tastiest)the best part about the restaurant was their clean restrooms and triple ply toilet paper.
4	So my boyfriend and I had a friend in town and he wanted to take us somewhere for lunch in China Town, I was excited because not only are we slightly new to Las Vegas and have not hit any places in MLV China Town but my friend Robin really knows what and how to order. We are very open to trying anything and everything new. We read the yelp reviews and wished we had came earler because of course, they were out of their famous Soy Sauce Chicken entree which I WILL be back for. We receieved awesome customer service from the owner/manger who helped us select lots of things off the menue. The HMO CHICKEN (I think it was called) WITH RICE was amazing mixed up with the sauces it came with. The garlic pepper chicken wings were also very very good. We had very fresh shrimp wontons and I was impressed with how fresh the shrimp tasted considering it is Las Vegas... The Ocho Vegtable dish they had went well with everything. We also had the curry and it was verrry good with some type of bread tortila to dip in it. I wasn't very fond of the pourage our friend ordered but I think it is more of a accustomed taste that is needed although my boyfriend loved it. Not only was everything great...the prices were outstanding! I will be back with friends and family expecially because you can call an hr or more ahead to have the Soy Sauce Chicken ready for you so you dont show up and they have ran out! I might even go there for lunch soon consdering I work very close to there :)
4	No need to make a joke about the name...it's Big Wong...not Big Wang!  =DThis is a review of their Shrimp Wonton Soup.It's cheap, it's good, it's fast, it's served piping hot & it hasn't made me sick the 3 times I've tried it.  Easily my favorite wonton soup in the valley.  The added greens are a nice touch.  All the other times I've had wonton soup, it was just the wontons.Granted, I need to try other things on their menu, but I always fill up on the wonton & am satisfied.  Don't expect anything fancy when you arrive.  I simply come here for a quick & delicious bowl of soup...not the decor.  If you don't feel like waiting to be seated at Monta...give this place (in the same strip mall/parking lot) a shot.
5	So glad my friends and I found this place! We were in the same plaza at The Foot Spa and we were waiting for a cab to come and we decided to stop into Big Wong and grab something to drink and maybe a little snack and we ended up having an early dinner there! The staff were so nice and the food is so good!What we had:Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings - super yummy and spicyOng Choy, Thai Style - so good that we had to get 2 plates!Fried Shrimp Wontons - yummy! just like a shrimp ball in a different formMango Pudding - it has mango chunks!Almond Pudding - it has litchi and longan bits in it.Sweet Roti Pancake - this is AMAZING! Roti with condensed milk and powdered sugar on top! It's so good, when I got home, I was craving it and had to go find roti to make and put condensed milk on it!
5	Found this place based on a recommendation by a Taiwanese friend of mine.  Later I had taken the whole family during the beginning of a road trip and they loved the food.  It was quite nice because my dad who has worked in a Chinese restaurant for over thirty five years himself is a very difficult person to please when it comes to eating out and he had nothing but praises, especially for their gravy, saying they did everything right.Pro: Great affordable prices, perfectly deep fried foods, home cooked style, personable service.Con: Smaller operation, therefore service can be slow at times.Unique: Mango pudding and the almond with lychee, both desserts made with real fruit and not artificial like most Asian places.
4	Fast, great value.... and a diverse different menu.
5	This place is amazing. Amazing because you get such delicious food for such a cheap price. Most of their items are about $5, and most do not exceed $10.The portions are filling to a man, for a girl, you may be able to split it into 2 meals. I got the Beef Noodle Soup and the broth was soooo savory! Delicious! The chicken curry is delicious too. I definitely recommend the salt and pepper shrimp and the fried chicken wings. So delicious.I don't recommend their porridge though, it tasted more like rice, which means they probably did not make the meat broth properly.Also, sometimes there are only one waitress and one chef, so it may take some time to get your food, but it's worth it. :)
5	best cheap Chinese in las vegas! yummy!
3	If you want some authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go!  Service was fast and the food was good and cheap!Items ordered:Beef Ramen - Don't expect Japanese Raman or anything near that.  The broth in this soup taste like beef stew and its yummy.  Very tasty and yummy.Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - Nom Nom Nom.... I love the chicken wings here.  Fried to perfection and the wings were season to perfection too.Shrimp Won-Ton Soup with Udon - This noodle soup was a little bland, but that is how these kind of noodle soup is supposed to be.  Will recommend this place to anyone who want some authentic Chinese food.
3	Great place to come if your on a budget and want good food and large portions. The dining room isn't as nice as it could be but the price makes up for the ambiance.PROS: House special shrimp wonton with egg noodle soupSalt & pepper pork chopHoi Nam chickenBeef ramen soup (as featured in articles posted on the wall)PricesCONS:The inside could use a small faceliftCASH ONLY!
5	Big Wongs i could say has the best authentic chinese food in VEGAS!! yes!! yet again the prices are so cheap to the quality of food they serve! friendly & great service. the steamed chicken is amazing! their Salt & pepper chicken wings are a must have! & to top off a great meal you have to try their Roti pancake! 5 Stars for big wongs for great quality food at a very affordable price!
4	My friend Samson took me here because he said it makes him feel like he's at home with how authentic it is. I have to admit it's pretty good. I got hai nam chicken it was really good and we got some water spinach. If your looking for cheap dishes and good taste try this place
5	As good as Chinese food you'll find in Vegas with each dish for about $4.95 to $7. One can't go wrong. The decor is bare basics but a terrific cheap eats with great Hainan chicken.
3	I came here based on yelp reviews....but it was only okay for me.I ordered the #8 which was roti and curry chicken. It was good...although the dish had more potatoes than chicken in my container.The lady working here recommended watercress vegetables when I ordered stir fry veggies in oyster sauce. She said the watercress was in season. I went with her recommendation but I only thought the vegetable dish was okay. I ended up throwing most of it away.
3	My friends love this place, I say it was A-OK. The steak was cooked perfectly though. I just find it odd that they serve the steak over rice and boiled potatoes, which by the way, potatoes were bland. It is affordable though.
4	You guessed it, this place have now been one of those places I come to when I'm in Vegas... the Hamione Chicken rice dish is still as good as the last reviews... and the shrimp wonton is still excellent
3	Cheap cheap Asian eats....* Cash only* Ok this place is amazing for being cheap (5-10 bucks)  but I wouldn't say the food is amazing.  Portions can be large from what I saw at other tables but our curry only had a handful of small beef chunks in it.* Beef curry with roti- Since this seemed to be one of the popular dishes raved about we tried it.  Not the most flavorful, kinda bland actually.  I think I can make a better curry than this (and it's made from curry cubes ala box!).* Shrimp fried wontons- The hubs and I don't normally order wontons but the waitress recommended so we gave it a try.  Mostly fried wrapper with a little ground up shrimp inside.  We ate the tasty shrimp and tossed the rest. Meh.I'd be open to giving this place a second try but I'd def. order something else...
4	I'm a bit surprised I gave Big Wong only three stars before. Although not five stars (that's reserved for stellar experiences). Big Wong is a HARD four stars. As four as you can get without being a five. The food reminds me of the steamy rice and noodle shops on Mott St. back in NYC. They are straight up delicious and priced to be ordered in abundance. I wish Big Wong was closer to my house. Like next door would be perfect.
3	The food was satisfactory but the prices were amazing! Tried the beef ramen and I would definitely come again for it if I was on a budget. Friendly staff
3	BIG WONG's is located at the corner of Spring Mt/Decatur just WEST of Spring Mt right after you pass "Jack in the Crack".  Its easy to pass up...Chinese food craving kicked in big time one night, there was no way that i was returning to (I will not mention the name of the other chinese establishment, just scroll through my reviews) but I was not going back. So I get on my YELP app and look up cheap ($) chinese food (don't judge me) BIG WONG'S pops up.  I'm all about supporting the local family owned business.I rate 3STARS for one reason only...the SHRIMP WONTONS, um DELISH yea!  It's nothing super fancy, very simple item.  I came across this item by default, I actually walked in for a killer egg roll but this restaurant does not sell EGG ROLLS.  and the lady looked at me like I had 2 heads and I asked for egg rolls. "I'm sorry lady, my mistake, I thought all Chinese Food restaurant serve egg rolls, they do in California."  Ok, I'm getting sidetracked here.....so no egg rolls but she suggested that I tried their Shrimp Wontons instead... -Shrimp - Wonton Wrappers - Deep Fried Goodness - served w/ a sweet and sour chili sauce.  all for $4.95 - 8pcsCrispy, not soggy or saturated w/ oil.  Made to order, I always do take out, they are sealed in a foil heat bag to keep them warm and crunchy.  This is so a MOM and POP joint, no fancy digs here.  I have never tried anything else on the menu because it does not appeal to me, I go there for one thing and one thing ONLY!!! SHRIMP WONTONS (simple deliciousness)Try it out, you might find something other than SHRIMP WONTONS on that menu that you might like-ENJOY ;-)
5	I love this place. It's cheap and and the food delicious and comes in a generous portion size. I've been here a few times now and my go to meal is the curry chicken with potatoes and roti. Being an islander and living on the opposite coast from my mom, I don't get all the good cooking. Oddly this meal even though it's from a different place hits the spot! The roti tastes just like how my mom would cook and I couldn't appreciate that any more than I do. This place is definitely a winner!
2	Place is ok if you're looking for a cheap price.  Food was ok..I had better.  Not that much food selection for a chinese restaurant.  Service was extremely slow.  I guess u get what u pay for.
4	Like a dubbed old school low budget kung fu movie, Big Wong keeps it simple with good menu selections and low prices.Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it. First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.  The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned! Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills. So if you want good food at low prices with decent service, you can't go wrong at Big Wongs! (Pun intended)
3	We ordered the chicken curry with rice, the beef with ramen, and the shrimp wonton soup. All 3 dishes were SIMPLE, but good portions for $15 credit card charge. The lady was pleasant and anticipated our wants: gave us an extra bowl and plate so we could share as it was our first time here. She did it without us having to ask for it. The prices are according with the quality and taste.of the foods. SIMPLE, pleasant, good portions,  and fair prices. We would go back to try other dishes.
3	HATE  Nothing.DISLIKE  The sloppily dressed, apathetic server. The styrofoam cups. How supplies, condiments, and other items were unorganized and visible to customers behind the counter. The multi-colored, haphazardly written poster menus on the wall.LIKE  The shrimp wontons. The sweet roti. The special seafood noodle soup. The smiling chef who sometimes helped front of house.LOVE  The beef ramen. The prices.
4	My second visit I ordered the chicken curry with roti  and chicken Hainan with rice. The roti bread was excellent . The Hainan chicken and the 2 sauces were delicious with a fluffy rice. We definitely will go back to try more dishes. The lady that doesn't smile is still very accomodating by offering me a glass of water while waiting for my order to go.
3	Been back a couple of times since my initial review...food is still good, but first time the owner lady was too busy fighting with the chef (husband?) and last time she was plain cranky towards me both when I called in for the order and when I went to pick up my food. As a small business owner myself, I would never mistreat my customers or take them for granted. I hope I can give them a better review next time I go back, IF I decide to go back. Then again, I can think of many restaurants more deserving of my support.
5	The most amazing hole in the wall place I have found in a long time! We ended up here accidentally after visiting a foot spa nearby, we were waiting for a cab and were told it would be 40 minutes before the cab arrived, so we decided to try Big Wong since we were amused by the name...and we were sure glad we came in!The waiter (who I think was also the chef) told us what was the most fresh and cooked it how he thought we would like it, and every bite we took was better than the next. Thai style Ong Choy, Roti, all of it was amazing. The ambiance isn't anything to write home about, folding tables, Styrofoam cups, hand-written menu posters - but the food made us look past all of that.Next time we are in Vegas, we will make the trip off the strip to Big Wong.
4	I gave this place another shot! The prices are extremely cheap. But don't expect much, you get what you pay for!  The utensils are plastic and your drinks are served in a foam cup, which I think is better than wondering if they washed it well or not. The food had good flavor, I ordered the chicken curry with the roti pancakes (3pcs) and my daughter had the beef noodle soup. The serving is pretty generous. The food presentation is blah! But if you're on a budget you can feed your entire family here and then still be able to order food to go... To which I did observe many patrons picking up food while I was there...I walked out with a $10.90 billAnd tipped more than 20%
4	This has got to be one of the best valued meals you could ever have in Vegas.  $5 for most of the menu items ranging from wanton noodles soups to curry roti to to Hainanese chicken.  The shrimp wantons are good (more shrimp than fillers) and the salt & pepper wings are very juicy inside the crisp, slightly spicy skin.  It's cheap food, with good portion sizes, cooked perfectly and served with a smile.  Great when you're broke from a night of befuddling.  I just wish they would change the overhead lights.  They were so dim they almost gave me a headache.  Sit by the window.
4	Tucked in what seems to be the best foodie shopping center in Chinatown Las Vegas, one may easily overlook this hole in the wall as other superb restaurants--Raku, Trattoria Nakamura, Kabuto, Monta and Curry Zen--are also in the same location.  If it were not for Yelp recommendations, I probably would have never gone to this restaurant.Looking through the menu, most of the items are under $5.00... my college fund definitely goes a long way in this place!!  I decided to try out their hainanese chicken since that is what the restaurant is mainly known for.  Being it my first time having such dish, I thought it was actually quite delicious!  The chicken breast was really tender due to the method of how it was cooked; also, the condiments (hoisin and chili sauce) add a great taste to the dish.  Also tried their chicken curry with roti and a fried pork dish... but thought I would rather get those elsewhere.Overall experience? Big Wong Restaurant is a great place for lunch due to their affordable prices but definitely do not walk into this place with high expectations--YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU ARE PAYING FOR.  I actually like how the restaurant crews were yelling at each other half the time I was there since it makes the experience more authentic.  I will definitely be back!
1	I've seen this place so many times, laughed at the name, but never stopped in until one day my other half suggested we go.Inside is a place with tables. This is common to Chinatown. It's low-cost and it seats people. The bathroom is strangely well-done, though. Anyway, you sit in a relatively warm place - again I'm assuming to save money. You get a small menu, and you get a selection of random things taped to the wall if you wish. I should specify - not food, but just bits of extra "menu."The waitress, or who ever she is, is remarkably unfriendly. She is merely a physical vessel for carrying food from the kitchen to you. No words. No smiles. Just a note pad and minimal contact.Ah, the food. So, it's kinda cheap at first. You think, "wow, what a good deal! $5-6?!" Ok, so you really get what you pay for. Everything is thawed, prepackaged, stuff. Just stuff. Nothing with much effort. If it could come out of a package, it did. Be it the fish balls, the roti, the chicken, or whatever. You can tell, everything is minimal. No extra love to preparation. The food is made and put on a plate, and thrown at you.I don't like. There are SO many better choices out there, even in the same center. Monta, Raku, SnowFlake...
3	My friends and I were looking for a quick meal before the show and were thinking of trying something different. In comes Big Wong to the rescue, right? Wong. Er, wrong.The first thing you'll notice, other than the walls interestingly adorned with handwritten paper menus, is the relatively dirt cheap prices. Almost everything we ordered was about $5, so the bar was already set pretty low. Unfortunately, the shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles just did not clear the bar for me. The "broth" was pretty much colored water - it had the same flavor, but a different color.I liked the curry chicken with roti. It had solid flavor and a pretty decent portion size. No spiciness at all, but they brought out a sriracha bottle in case we wanted it. I managed to use the sriracha on my soup to distract me from the utter lack of salt and umami, so that's a plus. I also had one of my friend's salt and pepper chicken wings, and that one also was yummy. I would recommend these two dishes for sure.So two out of three isn't bad, right? Not really. The problem is simple: if I can't rely on this place to be any good, I may as well go for one of the numerous other options in the area or even in the same plaza. I don't think I'll come back unless I'm somehow in the area and hurting for money.
5	I came here by accident, but boy was it a great mistake. The beef ramen has chunks of tender steak. It's not exactly bone-melting broth, but it's a hearty warm stew and the noodles have a fresh consistency. The real gem was the fried chicken and rice. All dark meat, fluffy rice, and egg for $5!  Some of the best Asian FC I've ever had. Come here to eat well and cheap!  Baller on a budget.
4	after reading the reviews, had to give it a try.  beef stew noodle, thats what it's called in hawaii, very tasty, though i like my broth saltier, ung choi with garlic, excellent, thank you waitress for the tip.  if you're in hawaii, order beef stew noodle with gravy, one of my favorites.
4	Great service, good food, and cheap eats. If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant that won't break bank, Big Wong is an ideal location for you because they offer an assortment of dishes for under $6. I ordered a special shrimp soup wonton with udon or ramen, I asked the guy if they had egg noodle, they did, so I went with that. I might have misread the title on the menu, because I was expecting regular wonton noodle soup with shrimp, which is what my other two friends had gotten, but what I got was actually shrimp soup. The broth was a rich red color and tasted exactly like shrimp. I probably wouldn't order that again because it was just too much for me to enjoy the soup, my mistake...but other than that, the noodles were great, wish they gave more wontons, but also I feel like the wonton were a tad overcooked, and the shrimp seemed mushy, but it actually wasn't.They had bok coy cooked 2 ways I believe, decided to go with garlic, and I thought that was their best thing there, also under $6, most Chinese places would probably charge like $9+ for that, unless you get it during like a special lunch item. But ya, the bok choy was flavored well, didn't taste or look old, it had that nice bright green color, good crips, I would definitely order that again. The curry beef looked good, didn't get to try it, and my friend said the beef ramen soup was delicious.
5	Chicken rice is good value for money! The sweet roti was very nice! Highly recommend!
5	Big Wong is great! The price for the food is unbeatable!Big Wong is located in a shopping plaza with other very popular restaurants(Snowflake, Raku, Monta) it is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss. The menu is short and simple but the food is all tasty, especially for being so inexpensive. The Hoi Nam Chicken (Hainese Chicken and rice) and the deep fried pork chop are currently my favorites and I highly recommend trying them along with the rest of the menu. Only negative is the food can take a while when they are crowded as their staff number is small.I highly recommend trying big Wong(and then go to snow flake for dessert:))
3	Surprisingly for a place that offers primarily chinese food the people there didnt speak a lick of CHINESe! Prices are cheap and inclusive of tax. i bet they are avoiding the tax themselves.I ordered the fried pork chop w rice. the lady brings out the rice and egg first and tells me the porkchop will come shortly. um what am i supposed to do w the rice without the main dish. i told her she should bring both simultaneously next time. she explains that someone else preps the chops. she said affirms my suggestion... not sure if she will listen but... uhhh ok... bring both out when they are ready. i ordered it as one dish not two separate dishes. For the prices i guess its a good deal! CC accepted for  $10+
4	Not bad Big Wong. I was able to satisfy my appetite under $5 bucks and wasn't disappoint. That goes without saying that it really wasn't anything spectacular. So I got the Special Shrimp Soup and added shrimp wontons for an over-the-top shrimpy meal. The food came out fast and my first impression was the broth was pretty shrimpy w/ a little bit of spice to it. It also contained udon noodles and chopped Chinese broccoli. Coming in, I was starving and at the end I didn't even finish all my noodles. So don't be fooled! The portion size is deceiving because of all the substance they throw into the bowl. On the minus side, they serve their drinks in styrofoam cups. And that's something I'll always frown upon. I guess it's cheap but couldn't you save more with washable plastic cups? C'mon guys. Service was abrupt but attentive. The restaurant was arranged to sit groups of up to 6-8 people. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and I'll be back w/ friends to try more of the menu.
5	Our return here was because of the Chicken Hainan with rice and the options of dark/white, bone in or out. It's simple, but tasty. The salt/pepper chicken wings is also another favorite of ours. We tried the Congee for the first time with boneless fish & pork with preserved egg and liked it. I still wish we had room for another favorite of ours, the chicken curry with Roti......yummy. This place is friendly, excellent value, fast, and satisfying.
4	I'm going to have to amend my previous review a bit because of one menu item.I was talking to a friend about how I didn't enjoy Big Wong at all, and he told me that he really likes one particular dish on their menu. Fast forward to this weekend when he suggested that we hang out. I asked if he wanted to "show me how good Big Wong can be," and he obliged.This game-changing dish was the ~$5 Hainan boneless dark meat chicken with seasoned rice (#2 on the menu). We actually split an extra order of seasoned rice, leaving us plenty to go around. The chicken and rice were both quite tasty and sufficiently seasoned, and I liked both the soy and the spicy sauces that accompanied the dish. I would certainly recommend this place as a cheap lunch (and an excuse to hit up Snowflake Shavery for dessert).We didn't get appetizers, but I'll stand by the curry chicken with roti and the salt and pepper chicken wings from my first visit. Just avoid the shrimp wonton soup and beef ramen like the plague.
4	My second time here. First time I was not that impressed. Today, my son dared me to return... Good choice. Thought it was gonna be typical Chinese fare but the food I had today was really good, I would definitely return....
1	I feel like I can't trust yelp reviews in vegas... The only thing that this place has going for them is that everything is cheap. Like most dishes are 5 or 6 dollars.Ordered:-hoi nam chicken over special seasoned rice (boneless dark)-curry chicken with roti pancakes-salt and pepper fish-thai teaThe only thing that was okay was the dark chicken, and not enough to make me want to come back. My husband, however, wants to give it a second try bc the prices are so cheap. Let's hope we can find something good on their menu. The lady serving was rude... But I think that's pretty typical of Asian restaurants, so I didn't find that too offensive.Also, i wonder why they can't use reusable plastic cups when they clearly wash their plates. All beverages are served in styrofoam cups. Ugh. I hate styrofoam. Not just bc it's not eco-friendly, but I might have an irrational fear of styrofoam. I hate the sounds and texture. It's just gross. :( Please get real cups!
4	Decided to finally stop by after one of my friends told me that they come here all the time. After we were seated and handed menus, I was surprised at how simple it was - a small rectangular laminted piece of paper printed from front to back. The front showed mostly rice and noodle dishes, which is what we decided to go with. Since there was only 2 of us, we ordered 3 items to share: fried chicken w/ rice, Hoi Nam chicken w/ seasoned rice,  and beef ramen. I was informed when ordering that the fried chicken would take 20 min to prepare, which I was ok with since we had 2 other dishes to eat.The Hoi Nam chicken and seasoned rice was good, and the rice had an interesting taste to it which we liked. The chicken seemed well seasoned, juicy and perfectly cooked. The beef ramen, wasn't really Japanese style ramen, but then again this is a Chinese restaurant so why would it be? It was more like a beef noodle soup with ramen noodles and kind of reminded me of Taiwanese beef noodle soup, just not spicy at all and with ramen noodles instead of rice noodles. The beef was soft, tender and not over cooked and the soup was decent, but could've been seasoned a little better. When the fried chicken finally came out it was extremely hot and crispy and therefore delicious. I would return just for this dish alone since I'm a big fan of seasoned fried chicken.Tried the almond pudding for dessert, which comes in a small container for $1.25 per order. The pudding was flavorful and refreshing, and included small lychee and longan in it.Service was ok, mainly because there was only 1 waitress working on a Saturday night when most of the tables were full. You might experience a slight wait when trying to place your order or get refills, but it wasn't a big deal for me because we weren't in much of a hurry.It was a nice surprise to see that tax is included in the menu pricing so what you see is what you pay. They do have a $10 minimum to use a card, but we decided just to pay cash. Our total was just over 17 bucks. What a deal! I'm sure I'll be back many times over in the future. Doesn't get any better than simplicity and low pricing at an Asian restaurant!
4	Yummy and cheap!  My husband and I tried out Big Wong and we both enjoyed it.  I tried the fried pork and he got the sirloin.  We just dumped the juices we got on the big cup of rice and enjoyed.
5	Cheap but yummy. I come to Las Vegas from California 2-3 times a year and I always come to this restaurant. Earlier this month I went to LV again for 3 days, and everyday I came here. I ordered different food everyday and all are delicious.
5	I guess it's about time for me to review this place. LOL! If your familiar with yelp, you'll notice that I got the most check-ins, ranking at #1. Anyways, we love this place, especially my 4 year old daughter. Her ultimate favorite is their Fried Shrimp wontons. We pretty much tried everything in the menu, but I myself always get thin rib-eye over rice and soup, either beef ramen or house shrimp soup with udon noodles. The hubby usually gets curry chicken with roti and soup, either their shrimp soup with wontons or seafood noodle soup. For those who say that the service sucks, we'll get to know Connie she's actually a nice lady. Although sometimes she has an attitude it's because there are some rude customers too. We have witness quite a few when we were there. Lastly it's clean I like that they use disposable utensils. I know it not Eco-friendly but in my opinion I feel safe that the spoon that someone put in their mouth will never be the same spoon that I'll be using. It's just I'm cool with styrofoam cups too :)! Oh yeah I almost forgot the price is so affordable. Every time we go here it's around $35-$40 with tip and I still have a little bit of left over for breakfast the next day.
5	We were originally going to go to Ramen Sora but it was busy so we drove to Monta but they were closed. Saw Big Wong, yelped it and it has a 4 star review so decided to check it out. We got 2 beef ramen noodle, 1 fried chicken w noodle and a soda. Came out to $18!! Their food is really yummy w awesome price tags. This is owned by a Thai & Chinese couple...from what I can gather. My bf overheard the main chef talking (big Wong) and that's how we started talking to them and finding out more info. Really friendly staff, can't wait to go back to check out their other dishes! ^_^
5	Beef Ramen is so delicious. We liked it so much that we went back the next day:). Best of yet, it's only $5.95. Hainan Chicken rice (boneless dark meat) is also very good, though we had better chicken. We also ordered vegetable with Hoisien sauce. Fresh and no disappointment. To sum it up, great comfort food at great price.
2	Beef ramen was okay. The soup was kind of bland but the beef was real tender. My wife had the shrimp ramen. She was not a fan. I give it a shot and neither am I.
2	Arrived in Vegas in the late afternoon and this was one of the few places that were actually opened on Thanksgiving. Our original idea was to go to the ramen place near this restaurant, but that place was closed for the holidays so we came here instead.I don't know if this was just an every day thing or a holiday thing, but the server gave us tea in styrofoam cups. Odd. Very odd. What restaurant actually does that? Mm..The lady server we had gotten didn't seem friendly. If anything, she seemed annoyed when she took our order. There was 10 of us so maybe that was overwhelming, but it just looked like we were troubling her by our order or something. The styrofoam cups should have gave me a clue. Besides their plates and bowls, everything else we had gotten was plastic. I had ordered their hoi nam chicken rice with white breast meat and oh man, it was... super dry. The sauce they gave me for it didn't even help hide the dryness of it. Ugh. I washed down the rest of the chicken while promising myself that I will never get this again. The rice it came with was good, but it didn't save the chicken. At least the bathroom was clean. 1 star for being opened on thanksgiving when everything else was closed. 1 star for not charging for tea.
5	I only ate here twice. One dine in and one take out. I think this is a family owned restaurant because when I dined it last time, the chef and waitress were yelling at each other in front of all customers..I love their curry roti!! Its so bomb. The roti was so buttery. It already tasted good without curry sauce. The chicken chunk in the curry sauce was big but dry though.Their hainan chicken was not bad but not crazy. I will definitely come back again since the food is not bad and actually really cheap!!
5	One of my favorite cheap eats in town! I always get the beef ramen with tendon. Its is super delicious. The spicy chicken wings are a must try too. The price, the portions, the location, and the quick service make this place one of my favorite restaurants. Try this place, you won't regret it.
3	Went here for lunch on a weekend. The place was not packed but you will see that the turnover was fast.  Ordered the following: Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup, Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings (Recommended), Pork chop with Rice, Steamed Chicken with Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. All the items need a tad more salt but the flavors are there. The price was very reasonable. The service was also quick. Will be back for sure.
5	No complain! Affordable price and good service! Rice and noodle were all yummy! We ordered 4 different dishes, and only paid $30 (including tips)!
4	I believe this Chinese or Malaysian cuisine. I had their house shrimp spicy wonton soup. For $5.. It was really good! The serving was good and the single lady serving like twenty people did her best. I'd definitely go back. They have a large growing menu with interesting items that are all really affordable. My other two party members got their chickens. One was fried and one was boiled. They both devoured their dishes. I got a taste of the fried version and the sauce it came with was delicious. Really good.
2	I'm not sure why people were soooooo amazed by their beef ramen, but it was very disappointing. It was full of beef flavor; otherwise, very plain. The hai nan chicken rice my mom ordered was nasty. The white meat was so tough? Whatever they did, even the dipping sauces didn't help. Fish porridge, it was pretty thick. Didn't look that appetizing. Overall, given the price of the food, it was ok, but I doubt I'd be coming back. Looking at the four star on yelp, I feel like I really got cheated. :( I had to give this a two star. On another note, why do these food places ALWAYSSSSS forget my drink? Food #2 place that forgot my drink during my trip in vegas.
3	Great Chinese food with good price ...We ordered curry chicken with peratha (roti), beef ramen and hai nam chicken rice ... All are delicious (very tasty) !
4	This place is awesome. The main chef regularly comes out to check if everything's up to par and has a great sense of humor! You absolutely MUST try the salt & pepper chicken wings along with the fried shrimp wontons! Everything here is just great!
5	this place ia the bomb!  you got to get soy sauce chicken, best i ever had!  best of food and best of prices
4	Cheap eats in Vegas short drive from the strip. Must try, their chicken wings!  OMG, the salt and pepper chicken wings are so delicious and the meat is super tender.  Got a great flavor and it's made to order. We also got some stir fried bok choy that was really tasty and 2 of their congee.  I love the preserved egg congee and pork.  Their fish congee was just ok, the fish smelled and tasted slightly fishy....  The congee is the thick style and it's like $4 for a big bowl.  In the midst of all the pricy places to eat in Vegas, this place is a nice break on your pocketbook if you want something simple and tasty.
2	My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas, and as we were driving up there he was telling me about this great restaurant called Big Wong he's been hearing about from a friend. We decided we would give it a shot due to all the great reviews we read about.. When we got there, there was a hostess/waitress who looked really irritated to see us. She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the doubleFish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas. We got our drinks in a styrofoam cup. It was weird but I guess that's their norm. I drank it pretty quickly since it was small, and had to ask for a water within 5 minutes. Also a styrofoam cup. We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny. Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional. Also, the waitress who was unfriendly the whole time, was on the verge of unpleasant. She seemed like she didn't want to be there serving us the whole time and I felt the negative vibe. Overall, this restaurant is cool if you're looking for acceptable quality in the food and cheap prices. Our total bill came out to only $20 so it wasn't bad. Make sure if you do go, try the wings. It'll make the trip worthwhile
2	I really like Big Wong. This is just to help them improve.Their service sucks.Everything is about $5 dollars.The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now. Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.Anyways they give you super small water cups.So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.But we are all positive that they got chicken.She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.No arguing with that right?So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.Needless to say she messed up.There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks. Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party. 3.5-4 stars for the food and price but 2 overall.
2	I totally echoed with some other reviewers, the service really sucked there! They never smiled and sometimes I feel that customers are paying them to treat customers badly. It's like they don't care if you give them business or not. The price is very attractive but then after visting there for couple times, I eventually figured that it's not worth it because I never ate comfortably in the restaurant when their faces (the only lady who served customers and the kitchen staff, especially the female cook) always look upset. Why can't they smile a little more? Like another reviewer said, we always said thank you, when being seated, when the drinks came, when the food came, we said thank you. But there was no acknowledgement of our thanks, and the face was like "whatever".The first time I went there I asked very politely if they have a bathroom (i asked after placing orders), and the lady was giving me an irritated look, as if I was a fool to ask.I think the food is cheap because they only have so few employees there. And I guess that's why there is no good service, I think anyone could go postal if one has to do everything with no help. I did see that "only lady" taking orders, serving drinks, bringing out food, sweeping the floor, etc, all by herself. Poor thing.....and poor customers too. I guess that's why the "only lady" always has an irritated face. Though I can be empathetic, I still disagree with such kind of service. But I still can't figure out why the female cook has an irritated face. The male cook doesn't have an irritated look. But then he works in the kitchen mostly, so can't really compensate the unpleasant aura caused by the other 2 ladies. By the way, the female cook doesn't come out often either, but for that one time she did came out, she looked at me as if I was an eye sore for her, and I was just eating, not doing anything wrong though.I think I would rather be starved instead of going back again....way too much discomfort to eat with that unpleasant aura. It's not worth it though the food is cheap.
4	I wish I had tried this place sooner! It really is awesome food for Decent prices. I really enjoyed the Curry and the rice. The service was quick. It feels like a nice family-run casual place. I do have one complaint... The layout of this joint! It was a chilly evening and the door kept opening so guests could come and go. I was FREEZING! I even wore my winter jacket the whole time. I probably wont go back until it is nicer weather.
5	Good eats for such a cheap price!Almost everything on their menu is about $5, give or take a little.Don't come here expecting the best customer service- lady up front I've seen is running around by herself, so don't be too harsh. The hearty food and low price that goes along with it makes up for their lack of customer service. Everything I tried (Hoi Nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, won ton soup, salt and pepper wings (YUM), and curry with roti) was surprisingly authentic tasting.Definitely fulfills your craving for Asian food without putting a dent in your wallet. I'm more than satisfied! Will be back for the salt and pepper wings!Not taking their customer service into consideration, 5 stars for food and affordability.
5	Amazing curry chicken & roti. The pepper chicken wings were great. Shrimp fried wonton was hot and fresh. Nice big juicy steak on the new menu was done perfectly. All this under $25... Aaaa-freaking-mazing !
3	Crazy cheap. We almost felt bad for not ordering more food because it was so cheap, but we weren't that hungry. The curry beef was so good because it had both a Hong Kong and Malaysian flare to it. It reminded me a lot of beef rendang which is my absolute favorite. My wife's pork chop over rice was only decent but cost less $5 so hard to complain. The place is very clean and all the dishes people were ordering looked and smelled great. The lady working the front could be a little friendlier and smile more. Other than that we were pleasantly surprised with this small hole in the wall.
5	Guilty pleasures. We all have guilty pleasures. And my guilty pleasure is Big Wong. ............Not that Big Wong! Get your mind out of the gutter! I'm talking about Big Wong, the unassuming Chinese/Malaysian restaurant in the Seoul Plaza (across from Snowflake Shavery). This place is crazy cheap, like 1982-prices cheap. So cheap... yes, I've wondered, what is making the "Special" Shrimp Soup so special. Yeah well, I'll take the risk because the food is absolutely delicious! I've only been there twice but they have over 32 items on their menu and I'll be updating this review often. I will try their entire menu, since most items are less than $5!!! What? And the portions are not tapa portion but are full-size portions, good enough to feed an adult for dinner. I LOVE their Curry Beef over rice. I can't pinpoint the country of the curry, it's a cross between Japanese Curry (I'm thinking House brand) but not as strong, and  panang or a masala. The curry has tender chunks of beef and is served simply over rice or roti. It is delicious.  Roti's are flat flour pancakes and they are delicious. I'm committing a faux pas by saying this but it reminds me of Fausto's flour tortillas. It has that delicious glutenous flavor. The sweeten roti has condensed milk and makes for a nice dessert. The Shrimp wonton soup with flat rice noodles are excellent too. They make great shrimp wontons. Honorable mention is the fried porkchop over rice (served with a 5-spice flavored gravy). Tasty but not my favorite item on the menu. I like their mango pudding too. You get a good portion for $1.25 and it has bits of real mango. Can't wait to go again. At these prices, I can afford to eat here every day! The Munchie Box has nothing on Big Wong (the munchie box at Jack-in-the-Box, get your mind out of the gutter)!
3	Like every other review here, food is definitely delicious, and kudos to the chefs.But because the food is priced so right, and the plaza is booming from the other restaurants.. business is picking up and service is completely nonexistent.Sorry lady, please don't be too danm miseriable, the energy is not good. They need to hire a few teenagers to help run the business or something.  As good as anybody can be, being the hostess, server, busser, cashier and trying to answer the phone is plain ridiculous.Add some music or a tv for some noise, the silence makes waiting more irritating.. Sorry for the rant but a business establishment needs to run efficiently in other for the customer to be satisfied5 stars for the food, but overall experience: 3 stars
3	Big Wong is probably one of the best places to go for a meal if you wanna get full by not having to spend a lot of money. Everything on the menu is no more than $8 or $9. You get a big portion for whatever you get as well. If you ever decide to come here I suggest the chicken curry with roti pancakes and or rice. Their curry is SO GOOD. The salt and pepper chicken wings are also appetizing. Everything here is like comfort food! Try it out!
3	Probably my favorite curry place because it is affordable, tasty, and filling. I haven't tried a lot of their other items because I only come here for the curry, but their vegetables are also very tasty. I recommend ordering the Bok Choy with your curry.Their curry has the perfect amount of spice for me and a good ratio of meat/potatoes/rice. I usually get the beef curry or chicken curry w/ roti pancakes (only 4.95)Now I have read that people don't really get the best service here, which is true. Personally, I just come here to quickly satisfy my curry craving and the food comes out so fast that I don't even care about extra service. This place is definitely worth the price and even if you don't like it, your wallet won't be crying.
4	The food is very good and the price is very decent. The only thing is be prepared for a the sour mood by the lady working there. The service is actually good but the attitude is less than desirable. Just imagine your mom having a sucky day at work and then having to come home to cook dinner and you'll get the idea. You'd almost rather order pizza if not for the fact that the cooking is so good.There would be 5 stars if not for the foul mood.
5	AMAZING FOOD! Highly recommend the shrimp wontons and the Thai tea. We had the fried chicken and noodle and the hoi nam chicken and both were delicious. Great service and very authentic food. And for the price? You cannot go wrong coming here!! I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!  Oh and don't forget the sweetened roti!
3	Big Wong is one of the best ways to get a $4.95 lunch in Vegas. Most of the menu is $5.00 and under. Price. Price. Price.If that's what drives you come here. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup with udon noodle. I found the broth to be too lightly flavored, but there was plenty of shrimp packed wontons and noodles to fill up. None of the food at our table was spectacular, but all of the dishes were fine.I may have judged this place too harshly, but it's hard to eat mediocre food when the best ramen in Vegas (Monta Ramen) and one of the best Japanese restaurants (Raku) are in the same shopping center for only a few dollars more.I will certainly try Big Wong again and try not to dream of tonkatsu ramen.
4	My husband would get takeout from this place every other day if he could. The food tastes good and it's cheap - around $5 for a dish. I like the chicken curry and the stir-fried bok choy. He will eat anything on the menu. This is our go-to place when we don't want to cook.
4	Just a little drive outside of the strip... This Cheap and delicious place offers a lot of Hong Kong/Malaysia style entrees! The average price is $6, and there is everything from curry, hainam chicken rice, fried pork chop rice to vegetarian and seafood options.I ordered the pork chop rice which came with a side of this amazing dipping sauce, pickled vegetables and a hard boiled egg.  Yum! My husband ordered the curry beef which was rich in flavor and good portion size. The two of us are here for about 10 bucks and walked away happy and stuffed.
4	First time visit was alright. I got the ramen w/ the fried chicken. The broth of the soup was unflavorful and tastes almost as water. But if you add the fried chicken in it, it gets better. I don't know if thats normal or not but overall it was pretty good. The staff doesnt really say anything or gives a greeting, or checks up on you while you're eating. You just do your own thing but I think thats expected since it is Chinatown. I'd come back though to try an entree w/ rice. :)
5	This place is far one of my favorites for hours of operation, but mostly it's consistent in flavor and taste. We ordered the usual salt & pepper chicken wings, curry chicken with delicious roti pancakes, fish congee with preserved egg, and chicken Hainan, dark meat & boneless. Good value for your money!
5	Excellent service, food prices, and food quality. They ran out of Ong choy but had Chinese broccoli and baby Bak choy. Had those two dishes in a garlic sauce. Also had thai iced tea, hai nam chicken, and a seafood ramen noodle bowl. Hai nam chicken was a tad bit too dry, but was pleased overall. They also ran out of the special Chinese chicken, Chinese sausage, and mushrooms noodle bowl!!! My total came out to be around $25. Will def come back again for such awesome food quality and friendly service. Of course this food is good for my wallet too!!!!!!!!!!!
4	Sup@ Yum Yum Goodness! We ordered 9a. Your choice of udon, ramen or egg noodles, mild spicy. Two Dessert Roti pancake. Steamed chicken with seasoned rice and fried shrimp wonton. Almond jello with lychee. Delish. We liked the service she was caring towards my 20 month old child. I always love going to places where I can take my baby be cause he does tend to make a mess. The baby chair was clean which is a big plus.P.S. They do not have the D. Crab over noodles anymore.
3	For cheap eats, Big Wong can't be beat.  You can find most dishes here for $5. A big variety of dishes to order from ranging from wonton noodle soup to curry with roti.  It's a small joint with one cook in the kitchen and one guy working the front room.  A good alternative if the line at Monta ramen is too long.  However I have to warn you that the flavor was a bit bland. . But for the price it really can't be beat.
5	I can't believe i have not been eating at the is place sooner.  Big Wong has some classic Chinese food that stick to your ribs goodness.  I have been going here after work for the past 3 weeks on sunday to pick up dinner.  IN a plaza with such great food, Big Wong fits in well with the rest.  The decor is nothing, and the inside is pretty bland, but the food makes up for it.  The beef ramen is always a safe pick as well as the fried chicken with rice.  So far everything I have ordered has hit the spot.  Nice classic home cooked feel.  Nothing spectacular, but if you are looking for comfort food, Big Wong is the place to go.
5	Stop in for lunch today with my honey. Very warm reception from the owner. We had the salt and pepper shrimp chicken curry and there salt and pepper chicken wings all of them were amazing the prices were on hit I will be back
5	This place delivers as advertised. My new additional favorites are the steam chicken bowl with lup cheong and vegetable,  ribeye over pasta/rice and all desserts. Cheap, but good eats!
5	Cheap and delicious.  Most items on menu are around $5.  I'd highly recommend the salt and pepper chicken wings and shrimp.  So good and addicting!  A staple in my Vegas eats.
5	Wife and I are on our gap year travelling, so whenever there is $ to be saved, we will definitely try. Was staying down the road to Big Wongs so decided to give it a try for brunch. First impression is a very dingey looking asian joint, but that was quickly dismissed once we got the food. We ordered fried pork chop/rice and a hainan chicken/rice for only $4.95 each! Cant really go wrong! Serving size is great and tastes great as well. So good in fact we went back 2 days later. Great for anyone look for a cheap asian meal, dont expect the best thing ever. Might be abit hard to get to without a car.
5	OK so where to start! first of all don't let this little hidden gem sneak away from you! the setting is small nothing fancy but the fool.......AMAZING!!! I ordered the fried shrimp wontons, crispy flavorful and full of shrimp! That's right full of shrimp not cream cheese with scallion and shrimp sprinkled in but full of shrimp! wait did i say that already? for under $5 bucks its a steal. I ordered for my entree I ordered the house seafood soup which was  loaded with delicious seafood from shrimp, crab, fish cake and fish balls; i got mine with the rice noodles, pure perfection! definitely will be going back!
2	Interesting place with a variety of different dishes.Prices are cheap, that's for sure, but they're definitely lacking in the flavor profiles of some dishes.We ventured here for lunch and had a Shrimp Wonton Egg Noodle Soup, Hainan Chicken with Rice, Gai Lan with Garlic, and the Curry with Roti.The Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup.Hainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry.  The rice didn't have that great hainan chicken flavor to it and the sauces they gave were just a spicy sauce and what seemed to be the soy sauce chicken marinade.The Gai Lan was good with lots of garlic.The Curry with Roti might have had to be the best dish.They were out of a lot of things, but not going to ding them on that.  I'm not sure if they even had the items, it would have changed my mind much.
4	The plaza this restaurant is in is full of amazing restaurants: Monta, Zen, Snowflake, and Trattoria Nakamura-ya. Big Wong has big flavors at a small price tag.Service is attentive and food is out quick.Soups are all fabulous: the wonton skins used are not cheap and the quality is evident when you bite into the shrimp-packed parcels. Broth was very flavorful and had just a bit of a spicy kick to it. Strongly prefer the udon noodles to the ramen noodles that are your other option. Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.BEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender.STEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens. Flavorful sauce is light, sausage is salty, and flavors complement one another for a balanced dish.SALT AND PEPPER WINGS are very salty and very peppery. Pretty sure this is not a dish you could order by itself, as even to eat just three of them I had to space out bites of wing with that of other dishes- if you have HBP you might want to steer clear, as the salt in this dish was quite high.Vegetable dishes here are solid: the baby bok choy in garlic sauce is my favorite (second only to the one at Ichiza but the portion here is  three times the size), and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is a staple as well.
4	Great place to come if you like good Chinese food on a budget. Also,love the shrimp wontons,crunchy on the outside tender on the inside...make sure to eat it when it is hot or else they will get soggy.lol.Happy eating your fellow yelpie Terri xoxoxox
5	My favorites now are Thai Ong Choy made by the Lady cook, thin ribeye, steam chicken with veg & lupcheong, curry chicken with roti pancakes, ha nan chicken dark boneless, salt & pepper chicken wings. Satisfying and excellent value.
5	It was our first time here... But we'll definitely be back!!!! Simple delicious fast. Great service. Great choices. Can't wait to try the ong choy Thai style!
2	After reading all the rave reviews I was very disappointed after trying this place for the first time.  Shrimp wontons were bland and a bit overcooked.  Chicken curry roti - the roti were a bit too greasy and the chicken curry came in a small cup which had many more potato chunks than chicken.  Hainan chicken came in a decent portion but very bland and a bit dry.  Other than that the place was clean and service was great and friendly.  True a lot of the dishes were $5, but given the lack of taste I wouldn't mind pay a little more for better tasting food.
4	We were planning to eat in because it said they close at 11, but they said they were only taking orders to-go... but it was only 9:50. Not sure if they have different hours on Sundays but it wasn't indicated. We ordered the deep fried shrimp wontons and shrimp wonton soup. We were blown away! The soup was great, not oily or salty... and the wontons were addicting! We couldn't believe everything was under 9$. Majority of the food was around 4.95$! Can't wait to try and dine-in next time... we will definitely be back!
1	Big Don't. The server is very rude and there is only the one server. I'm tired of her rudeness. My family eats out a lot, all kinds of foods, but we will now stop going to Big Won't and their Big Waitress Attitude, she is always rude. She acts like she's Big Won and you're nothing won. She treats people like she hates her life or something. I have taken my family there for over 2 years or so, maybe once a month. She was rude starting day one, we ignore it, hoping that she becomes more polite. But she's the most horrible server.  Her energy is almost hateful. You have to make a loud noise to request any attention from her and sometimes that is not enough, she will ignore you talking to her sometime as well, and then you have to get up and go to her with any request, including if you want to order extra food. She never ask if you need anything, she acts like she's pissed off even when you try to pay. I feel a little sorry for the owner, she is costing him money because if people want to order extra food, his restaurant will profit more but the waitress always treats you like she's angry if you ask her for anything, including ordering or paying your bill. I guess losing profit is what he deserves, he's responsible for her being there. Her bad attitude is weird because it never change even though we keep being nice to her and even give her good tips, hoping she will realize what's going on but it doesn't work, she just always remains rude. Her disrespect, has never ended, so it's not worth the cheap food. We're done, she BIG FAILED, long time.
3	It's a small operation. Kind of like a "Hole in the wall" but the food was tasty. Great place for a lunch stop but not a place to bring a date or a business lunch if you want to impress. What it has going for it is it's inexpensive and quality is pretty good. Not a bad spot for lunch.
2	This restaurant has been on my bucket list for what seems forever.  The interior is small and dumpy - not a first date destination unless you are trying to send a message.  Staffing appeared to be a husband and wife with one other person in the kitchen.  My wife chose the shrimp wonton soup which was salty and pretty much devoid of flavor though the wontons were good.  I ordered the steamed chicken with mushrooms, Chinese sausage and choy som which was just okay.  We also shared a mango pudding that also was just okay.  Service was good and prices low, but I do not consider our meal a bargain because the food quality and ambiance were below average.
3	3.5 stars for hainan chicken w rice.  1 star for the curry beef brisket w rice.
5	Very friendly, good portions for cheap but food is very good and very tasty def a place to come back to
1	Fuck this restsurant what a fucking rude waitress not coming back hre u say tgank you u cant even get a respnse they can ubderstand english though ....
2	My roommates told me about this place, they had brought the shrimp Wontons. They brought some home and let me try it, I was hook. I ended up going to Big Wongs earlier today. I  order a few things. The shrimp wontons I order and then I order the fish balls, then the deep fried pork on white rice, then I order the beef noodle ramen. I'm not that impress. I see why it's cheap cause you get what you order from the price range. The beef ramen has a strange weird smell and taste. Its fresh but it just had that strange taste and smell. The fish balls wasn't real fish, it tasted very generic and fake, almost like a hot dog shape like balls, the texture is like the hotdog inside texture. The shrimp wontons are great as I said earlier, the deep fried pork on rice was good. I feel like I wasted money, I spent 24 dollars and I tip them 5 dollars and so altogether 27 dollars. The best thing I like was the food was packed pretty good, nothing will fall out. The food tasted fresh. The lady that took my order didn't have a personality but she wasn't rude and so that's good, a least she wasn't rude but no personality. I guess  this is a learning experience to be careful and do my research on a restaurant first before going over there. Lesson learn for me. It just sucks when you have your hopes up high, in hopes that you will get great food and then you eat the food, to find out the disappointment of wasting money and not enjoying the food that I order. I'm sure they have other great things on the menu but I won't ever be back at that place again. I tasted way better. A least there is some positives about this restaurant. I'm not going to even sweat the negatives thing, I just laugh and keep moving. I'm just thankful to have food. Life goes on, we learn, That's what makes us better people.
2	The food is only okie but all the good food all way run out in 2 hours so they open at 10 am to 11 pm do not come after 1:00pm because u never got ur good food ... So don't waste time if u want to come late... No point and u will be upset !! And the service is bad so per pair for that too!
4	A sweet little gem in Las Vegas.Fantastic comfort food at great prices. By great prices, I mean "holy crap, that was so cheap and so good."Worth the drive if you're into comfort Chinese food.
5	I love this place! It's low key, nothing fance, but dang good home style cooking. Been here every single time I set foot in Vegas. I've tried rice dishes, noodles, curry, and I love them all. The chicken wings and whatever fresh veggie they have is a must get everytime I'm here.
3	Food 3Atmosphere 2Service 2Wait time (there was only us)Price 4
1	No this is nothing fancy, neither were the flavors. In fact, the special seafood noodle soup was practically tasteless. I expected at least a little spice (had a chili pepper next to it), but the red colored soup was nothing but an illusion of blandness... A lot of toppings though I must say. But that did not make up for the runs I had after consuming 3/4 of the bowl...The won ton egg noodle soup was the most bland I've ever had - and I had pretty high expectations since this is rated 4 stars on Yelp - disappointing. Everything was subpar except for the shrimp won tons.If you're looking for dirt cheap food and don't care about the quality, then this is your place. There are definitely other places nearby that serve much better quality and authentic food. I can't believe how highly this is rated... maybe it's the noodle soups that suck.
5	Solid Chinese food. The reason I five star is because of the prices. Can't find these prices anywhere else for quality of food. Try it out. Good comfort Chinese food.
3	I've been here twice. It's nothing special. Prices are dirt cheap. There is only one wait person and only a couple people in the kitchen. Only 1-2 other groups when I came. Here's what I ordered:Hainan Chicken 5Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings 2Roti 3Wonton Noodle Soup 3Reminded me of home cooking - which I sorely missed.
5	Great find for a late night dinner after shows.  Their shrimp and shrimp wonton "hoi fun " soup was delicious.  A family of 6 - total tab was $45 before taxes. Don't expect too much service because they are short on staff but the food and prices offsets that.
3	Dim sum was acceptable but not great. Fried taro was bland. The hat how was fine , too, but not great. Nothing was really warm. The servers were friendly and so were the hosts.  The small beef dumplings were ok but , again, not so tasty.
3	The shrimp wonton soup is the best thing here. And that's about it.
4	Simple but delicious, quick Chinese. Hai Nam chicken with rice! Most likely will come back to try the great and inexpensive menu and not bad service.
1	I was not impressed by this place at all. The food was simply not good. Everyone In our party got different dishes so we could try a variety of Items on the menu. Sad to say, that we could barely even finish them. I get it, it's cheap but even that can't compensate for quality and flavor.
2	First time there place is need of a makeover. Prices are dirt cheap, the ac was struggling to cool the place down. I hate eating and sweating. There is only 1 cook and 1 waitress for the whole restaurant. I was getting aggravated trying to get the bill she was so busy with all the other tables!!!get some help...plastic utensils!! seriously are we in elementary school! food was pretty good. I probably would never go there again but if I would, only order take out
4	I love the food and I love coming here for beef Ramen chicken curry salt-and-pepper chicken wings and a must...deep fried porkchops omg so good!!! Prices are cheap you cannot beat them!! Now for the band news.. The worst customer service ever!!! There is one lady trying to serve everybody in that restaurant, the place is not big and small but still she's very rude!! She slams all the plates on the table, she's always in a hurry, and she always makes these weird faces, if it wasn't for the price our the food being so good, I wouldn't come back!! I only go back because the food is!! Food is worth it the lady needs to leave!! Overall from 1 to 10 I give it an 8, it would be 5 full stars it would off will been a 10 if it wasn't for the lady
5	Great food at a very affordable price, normally it would be 4 stars but because it is so cheap with great value 5 stars. Be warned that with the great prices they lack in service or presentation.
5	This is my first time going here. I'm going here w/ my family. They taste good n the price is cheap. The stuff are friendly too. We hope to going back to this restaurant again
5	The wait staff and chefs are super friendly, except the female waitress... She's not friendly but she does her job. Couldn't hurt to see her smile every so often. Greeted with a smile by the chef the moment we walked in through the door. Good start :DPrices were quite reasonable and we were surprised at the amount of food they give considering that most of the items on the menu are and average of $7/$8 range.Eats: Ong Choy (Thai style) - It's some green veggie that is super crunchy and served on a sizzling plate. I love garlic and they are quite generous with the garlic In this dish! Shrimp Wontons - There is hardly any fillers in there, it's almost all shrimp!We're pleased with every visit, the female waitress kind of knows us and is starting to warm up to us lol. Repeat visits, yes.
3	Great place to come for good, cheap food but because of recent service experiences I'm sad to have to downgrade them because it's no longer of 4 star quality overall when you factor in their terrible customer service. If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out. There is usually only 1 server and a couple of kitchen staff which is likely why...Not sure why the people working here are always so grouchy...especially the lady that serves the food!
4	Cheap, tasty, cheap, fast. Everything is good and will not even make a dent in your wallet. Great meal, especially after a night of partying in the club. Our group of 7 people had no stomach issues, so Big Wong gets a big thumbs up from us!
4	What a fun little restaurant!   I wished I had tried this place sooner.   Kitchen staff that doubles as wait staff are funny,  friendly and know their food.  I went with two of the favorites.   Salt and pepper chicken wings (#21) and house special spicy shrimp noodle soup with won tons (9a).  You have a choice of three noodles so I went with udon.The chicken wings were fried well so they had a crispy exterior and gloriously moist interior.   Best wings I had in ages!   8 wings is a good portion.   The soup came out hot and spicy as ordered.   The shrimp were plentiful,  tasty as well as the won tons.  Plenty of Chinese broccoli in the broth added great color and texture.   The soup is served with extra green onions and a bottle of siracha to add heat to your personal preference.   Best of all, this filling meal was only $13. Your money goes far here while your taste buds go on a joy ride!   This place stands on its own even though wedged between the trendy Nakamura Ya and Monta restaurants.
4	One of the CHEAPEST place of the Vegas strip for Chinese food. Like %85 everything on the menu was like under $5.00. This place is like a true hole in the wall restaurant. For $20 dollars, i could get a decent family style meal with some friends. My only complaint is that the curry that i order (what was advertise) was a little under seasoning. To me, it tasted a little water down. But the chicken make up for the curry sauces. I felt like he chicken was the curry it self. But overall all the other dish were great for under $5.
1	I believe, the only reason why this place receives business is because people rather not wait for food at the ramen place across the plaza. Not great. The Thai tea is cheap but comes in a small styrofoam cup and filled half with ice. Also, if your group orders the Thai tea, some will have a good amount of milk and some will not. I chose the house seafood special with rice noodles. The soup was not spicy at all and the soup base made me feel sick. Everything is cheap, but that's all the quality food you get.
2	All the positive Yelp reviews got my hopes up for an outstanding meal on the cheap. Also, being from NYCnand having frequented Big Wong in Chinatown there, I really was hoping to find a restaurant here to call home. I was pretty disappointed. The prices are definitely easy on the wallet but the food was just bleh. The service was also crummy. When I was waiting for my food, the cashier (owner?) was in a heated argument in the kitchen  with the chef, who seemed like a relative. I believe the care that goes into cooking is affected by one's mood so I was  not too thrilled to hear the heated exchange. I may return to give it a second chance though not sure when that'd be.
1	Most of the food tastes like they came from frozen food packages. The soup for the soup noodle tastes like the packet ramen that I cook. Hainanese chicken was dry. Congee was thick and rough. Not my kind of cooking. I won't be going back.
3	Great food for the price. Most dishes are $4.95. I took the office staff to lunch today. The last time that I came was over a year ago. Quality of food is still good and the food comes out quick. Restaurant still looks clean. We had the chicken curry, chicken and rice, and the wonton soup with egg noodles. One of the reason why I do not want to come back is because our waiter is not friendly. She never smiles. When we say thank you, she doesn't make eye contact. We use to go very often, but every time we go, it's as if she never met us before. No matter how good the food is, customer service means everything to me. We were actually going to have lunch elsewhere, but we decided to come here because of the quick service.
4	First of all, food here is really really cheap and they don't scrimp on the portions either. This is the place where you want to come when you're down on chips but still want to have some chicken rice. Food is not the best, but they certainly make it up for its affordable price and portion
4	Super cheap but no alcohol :(.  The service was excellent and I still can't get over how cheap the prices were...I thought they were serving appetizers or something.  Excellent food and conveniently located off the strip.
5	This place never disappoints me. Last night my wife had gone wth her girlfriend for some drinks at a local pt's and our son was with grandma. So I was rewarded with some me time and decided to just drive. My stomach reminded me that it was way past dinner time and I unexpectedly ended up here. After looking at montas storefront with the crowds and long waits I figured, why is nobody giving Big Wong some love? I looked in my wallet and I had a crisp $10 bill waiting to be spent so I said to myself why not?Now  I'm not Chinese but if I were I would assume that this is pretty much comfort food. I had their fried chicken over seasoned rice($1extra) and it sure hit the spot. It takes longer to cook the dark meat(about15 minutes) but I was ok with it. You get a generous portion of whatever ever dish you get. So far I've only had the fried porkchop over rice, hoinam chicken over rice, and the fried chicken over rice. I'll be coming back because I feel I should try everything on the menu especially the fried wonton shrimp. Some people across from my table was having that and I was compelled to ask those strangers if I can try a piece lol. But alas, I did not.The guy at the register is a no frills no bs server. You come in, you order, you eat. Sometimes that's just what I need. No bs. Eat here. Give the guy money. And leave with a Happy stomach. A++. Thanks Big Wong. You're always coming through.
5	This place is wonderful. I tend not to be a huge fan of a lot of traditional Chinese food due to texture, but this is definitely not the case with this place. We got the salt and pepper chicken and the special deep friend chicken over rice. The sauce that came with the latter dish was absolutely AMAZING, I couldn't have enough! We asked for a bowl to bring some home, and the man working so kindly brought us a fresh and warm cup ready to go. The staff is overall super friendly.The prices are so cheap here. Between two people for 3 dishes it was barely over $20. Definitely give this place a shot, you won't regret it!
4	It was pretty good had the chicken katsu curry service was slow and took foreverbto get the check
2	The service isn't good, but I'm not interested in service at a poh-dunk little hole in the wall of a Chinese restaurant.  It's the food.  And the food isn't good here.  They managed to screw up fairly simple Chinese dishes.  Overcooked meats and various dishes improperly seasoned were enough to just say "NO" to ever coming back to the Big Wong after two occasions of receiving untasty food.  And I wanted to llike this place...
1	pls have a menu on here!!!!!
1	I came here one day around 2pm. I was starving as it was my first meal of the day. The food here was so disgusting that despite my big appetite, I could not finish the food. The shrimp in my noodles were still cold & the salt and pepper pork was soggy and lukewarm. The only thing I liked was the curry and roti. I think they pre-cook and re-heat the food. It came out way too fast to be freshly made. Would not come back again.
5	We had Fried shrimp wontons, hai nan chicken rice, and fried shrimp wontons for lunch. All the dishes are delicious. Price is cheap. The restaurant is very clean  with open kitchen. Highly recommended.
4	Good food. Beef brisket noodle soup was authentic and can't believe how big the Chinatown is over here.
2	The italian noodle with rib eye is great but the sauce which taste too light , and the noodle with shrimp and wonton, the soup almost no favor in it, no recommend the two dishes!!! anyway , it is nice place for low price !
4	I love this place! They have affordable and delicious food menu. They serve a very decent "home-cooked" meal. The place was relatively clean and their restroom looks pretty maintained. If you are with a group I suggest you ask a pitcher of water because often they forget to refill your cup. They only have few employees but they're trying to be efficient as possible. One of the nicest asian restaurants I have had. I enjoyed my every visit. :)
4	Fast and super cheap. Big Wong looks pretty questionable but actually turned out surprisingly good.The menu is short and sweet with maybe a total of 30 items (15 items per side). The prices are ridiculously cheap- everything is around $5-6. The portions aren't very big though, so I would suggest 1-1.5 dishes per person. Everything we ordered happened to only be $4.95/entree ($20 total) and was enough for 3 people:- Shrimp wonton soup with mustard greens- pretty standard, broth on the lighter side- Dark Meat Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice- this is pretty much Hainan chicken, which is cold/room temp chicken served with a delicious chicken broth-flavored rice and dipping sauces of soy sauce and oil and mild chili garlic paste, great portion of chicken, would say they could add more rice though- Fried salt and pepper chicken wings- comes with some fried pieces of jalapeno, maybe 10-12 wings per plate, pretty flavorful and not too much batter- Authentic curry chicken with 3 roti pancakes- perhaps my favorite dish. This one is Malaysian curry so it's darker and more liquid than Japanese curry. The curry has dark meat chicken and potatoes. The roti that it comes with is delicious and perfect for dipping in the curry.
4	Friendly owner, cheap good food. What more can you ask for? Definitely try the roti.
5	Was waiting for a seat at Monta Ramen but was too hungry to be patient. So tried Big Wong instead... I haven't seen such moderate prices in a long time! Most items/dishes were $5.95. Almost 95% of menu was $7.95 or less. Food quality was decent. Definite value proposition!
3	3.5 stars.Big Wong is a small Chinese Restaurant that isn't meant for big parties haha if it were to be described like it is in San Francisco, the interior could resemble easily as a hole in the wall.The utensils provided, I believe but forgot, are even plastic I think haha water is also served in plastic cups. What bun and I enjoy is the Thin Rib Eye with Pasta which also come with potatoes. Dish is about $6.95 I believe and is a hefty portion too. Their Special Fried Chicken Dark Meat only isn't bad either. Those would be my two choices. I'll be back to try other foods. This place is a great alternative for a budget meal. Skip the veggies cause they could be better, but if you've been yeet-hay, it'll do for now.
5	I really don't understand why anyone would give Big Wong's a poor rating.Good food, great prices, very clean...what more could you ask for?  Some may come in expecting too much.  At these prices, you get more than what you pay for!There is a reason that so many give such high ratings.  If you have never been, you HAVE to try it for yourself.
4	I literally order from here for almost two weeks straight for lunch. Prices are insanely cheap. Majority of the items were six dollars or less. Service was okay, but I always order to go. I love their fried shrimp wontons!!! So good. However it does seem like they use msg in their food. After eating their food, I'd get this headache and itchy/dry throat that I normally only get after consuming lots of MSG. :/
2	Cheap food, every time I have gone they always have forgotten something I ordered, never came back to check on the table , and feels rushed . I feel kinda ripped off when I get small styrofoam cups for my drinks.
4	Great value meal. Cheap, quick Chinese food. Fried shrimp wontons were excellent and chicken wings were nice and crispy. Don't expect anything groundbreaking.
5	I always order the authentic hoi nam chicken over special seasoned rice, super delicious and plus its affordable!
5	Wow! Super  cheap  prices  and super good food...I tried the  fried wontons which was all shrimp wontons, egg noodle wontons, and fried chicken wings which was all delicious and $4.95 per portion. Can't  beat the prices and quality of food. I definitely  will be returning to try other dishes.
5	The menu has the standard Chinese food, nothing fancy.  I asked for the "largest portion", and they suggested the chicken curry.  Pros- authentic Chinese food, speedy service, and low prices.  I told them I was hungry and the dedicated chef(I've seen the same guy cooking every time I've eaten here, making great and consistent dishes) served me my dish right away.  The curry has it's standard delishesness, but unlike other restaurants, this stuff was authentic Hong-Kong-style flavors.  I've tried the wonton noodle, and they gave me the biggest wonton in my soup.  The value of this restaurant is amazing.  (5 stars)Cons- I can see how people expect a fancy restaurant with Dragon statues and large Chinese symbols to display "prosperity", but I'm more about the "mom and pop" shops with home-grown flavors that can reminds me of childhood.  (5 stars)
4	Ok... So there are probably 100+ reviews about the name of this place, so I'll go ahead and make it 101.. If this is Wong, I don't wanna be right! Maybe one more...you can't go Wong here!I'll leave the other jokes about how good Big Wongs feel to someone else!Onto the review! This is a super casual (read, not fancy), but very affordable restaurant in the Chinatown area. They have lots of choices, and everything we sampled was really tasty!The chicken curry with roti was delicious. I could have eaten the roti by itself all day long, but the curry was no slouch either!The shrimp wantons.. .Give me more!! Amazing!The salt and pepper chicken wings.. You can't go too wrong with chicken wings, but these were great!We also had the stir fried Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.As everyone else has said, the prices are VERY affordable, so you can try quite a lot without breaking the bank.
5	Three words "delicious, cheap & clean". If you like chef Ramsey show, this place has Asian version of it. You'll be hearing Chef Wong from the kitchen, sort of funny. We ordered 7 dishes total cost less than $40, so worth it! -Garlic chicken wings-Salt & Pepper pork chop-Roti & Curry chicken-2 Wonton soup-Heinan chicken & rice-Salt & Pepper chicken over riceAll of them taste delicious. We stuffed ourselves before heading back to home. We'll miss you.+++for super clean bathroom
4	Must try their Hoi An chicken with ginger steam rice. It was so good. The price is even better $4.95 per plate. The male owner was very nice and attentive. The lady owner was more like straight to the point kind of person, but she wasn't rude or anything. This is a small restaurant with very casual setting, so if you are expecting something fancy this is not it. What is great about this restaurant is that it's located in the strip of local stores next to kungfu boba tea and shave ice. You can go for dessert after your meal without the hassle of finding parking.
1	I don't know if we went in on an off day but this place was horrible! We were in town for a week and we were craving a good Chinese food place since we live in small town with 1 Chinese food place and it is just as horrible. There was 6 of us and we decided to give this place a try after reading reviews, it seemed like a decent place. I kept trying to convince the others to instead go to the Ramen place next door but they were stuck on this place. After eating here they wished they would have listened to me.We were seated pretty fast, the waitress was kind of rude but no biggie. The prices looked good. We ordered and got our food pretty fast. We all got an order of shrimp wontons, first bite was full of grease and the shrimp was rubbery. I tried the beef ramen, it was no better than the kind you buy at the store for less than a dollar. My friend got a shrimp ramen and everyone who tried it said it tasted like dog food. The chicken wings were OK, not great but OK compared to everything else we ordered. Nobody ate more than a couple bites of what they ordered. We joked that if we ever wanted to dine and dash this would be the place as we could not justify paying for the garbage we were presented with. Nonetheless, we made our way to the counter to pay and as we walked passed the other tables there were full plates of food left on almost every table. Guess we weren't the only ones who felt the same. We were convinced we were all going to get food poisoning, surprisingly we didn't.
5	Good, fast, cheap. Authentic Chinese cafe food with items for unfamiliar with ethnic food. Very happy I found this place. Small, simple, but good.
1	Not even one star, bad service, bad attitude, never visit again
3	Came here with a group of 5 in the early evening before the dinner rush. Ordered a bunch of things on the menu including the Hainan chicken and rice, braised beef, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed fish fillet, and wonton soup, as well as various stir fried veggies.The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge. The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food! So we asked for more rice, which was brought over in a huff and slammed on our table. Kind of made for a tense dining experience, if you ask me.Might be worth it if you love hole-in-the-wall joints like this and have thick skin to boot!
3	It's an average four star due to price and quality of food based on the multiple times I've been here but the most recent time I went there (day after Christmas), makes it a 3.Not sure why such a popular restaurant would not get extra staff during the holidays but there were only two people doing the cash register, bussing the tables, and serving food in a restaurant that was completely packed and with a line waiting at the door. The woman who normally is the only person in there started getting frustrated and had a sullen mood as people began to complain. Good food for cheap but I would never go during the holidays. While I doubt my complaints on their service will not matter as people will still go here for cheap, delicious food-- to me, they would be earning more money if they could serve people faster and get them out the door with 1 or 2 more waiters.
5	Great price with good food. The place is clean. The service is standard, no complain.  The only suggestion I have is: hire more servers.
1	We came here for lunch because of the 4 star review on yelp. When we went inside the restaurant, a woman was making wonton. She sat us and gave us the menu. We ordered three dishes and while we were eating. I notice the lady doesn't wash her hands after she touches the menu, take orders, answer the phone, serve food, and clean tables. With her unclean hands, she makes Wontons. I felt so uncomfortable and disgusted. I will never come back to this place. I hope the owner read this review and instruct the workers to mandatory wash their hands before making Food!
4	Love this place! Consistently good food and so affordable!! $5.35 for my noodle soups, after tax!! Their shrimp wonton noodle soup is bomb! Also, it has no pork/meat filler--all shrimp aka pescatarian friendly! ;)Also, the older man who is at the counter sometimes is really friendly. Gives great recommendations and prompt service.Unfortunately, the woman who is at the counter other times is just plain nasty and has absolutely no customer service skills or even basic human courtesy--hence why they get 4 stars instead of 5. I just do not understand why people in general feel the need to have a bad attitude / stank face all day and be nasty to people for no reason, much less someone in a customer service role...happiness is a choice people! :)
5	We were trying to go to the ramen noodle place in the same shopping center but the line was ridiculous.  Thank goodness because we went to Big Wong instead where we didn't have to wait at all and the food was excellent and very inexpensive.  We got fish ball soup and half a chicken. Very very good especially for the price!
1	worst service....never again
5	Two words. WONTON SOUP. Oh my gosh, it's addictive. During my trip to Vegas, we actually intended on eating at the ramen restaurant in the same shopping center. We parked in front of Big Wong and joked that we would go here as our back up. We were so hungry and the wait at the ramen place would have been at least an hour, so we reluctantly came to Big Wong. Lo and behold, it was a GREAT decision. There was no wait and the food is delicious and fabulously priced. We ordered wonton soup, soy sauce chicken, and a few wonton soups with noodles. My only food critique was that the egg noodles we ordered with the wontons was undercooked and somewhat tough, not soft and elastic like it should be. Great portions and great prices. Fed my family of 5 for under $40 (including tip!). We were so satisfied that we came back AGAIN during our 4 day trip to Las Vegas. Plus, how can you not go to a place called Big Wong while in Vegas, right?
5	Will come here every time I visit Vegas.  Down and dirty HK style cafe food.  Food is super cheap, great quantity & food is piping hot.  The staff seem to have a constant arguing banter in the background - just like home.Fried Chicken Wings - YUMMY!!!! GET THEM!
