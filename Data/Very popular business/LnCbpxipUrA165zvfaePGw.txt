5	FINALLY!!! Hitting the streets of Las #Vegas the 1st gourmet @SliderTruck. I took part in their soft-opening event at the park on W Flamingo/Buffalo last Saturday from 11-2. What a great start!!When I arrived shortly after 11 there was already a good size crowd gathered and things were in full swing. Chuy and Ricardo the operators of the truck were real friendly and very personable welcoming everyone to try some of Las Vegas' Gourmet street food.There was a limited menu to keep it simple for the event and all items were ONLY $1 each so I ordered one of each:) Pancakes in Blueberry sauce-A Captains Order Slider and a Monte Cristo.The sliders were FANTASTIC!!! I wanted to make sure everyone got to try some or I would have went back for another half dozen "Captain's Order" Sliders!! :)The pancakes were great too, what I got to try the kid snatched them and ran off to scraf them down;)I really enjoy street food and hope to see the @SliderTruck succeed maybe even encourage a couple more trucks soon ;) I've already passed out 200 flyers in my neighborhood to get people out to try the @SliderTruck this Thursday 3/25 11-12pm. Come join us at 3100 W Sahara just 1 block West of Palace Station!!
3	I caught up with the Slidin' Thru Slider Truck today at the park near Flamingo & Buffalo.  They had a "tasting menu" going (none of the items on the regular menu were available):1.  Kalbi rib slider2.  Beef & cheddar slider3.  Mac & cheese sliderUnfortunately, the Mac & cheese had already sold out by the time I got there (around 1pm).  I ended up with two of each the others, at $3/per.  I've posted some cell-phone pics of my order for everybody to check out.The Kalbi Rib slider was served on a lightly grilled bun about 2.5-to-3 inches in diameter.  The boneless beef rib had been prepared in a shoyu/garlic/ginger marinade (nice!) and topped with some grilled cabbage which gave some crunchy texture contrast.  The protein was a bit toothsome, but nothing that would turn you off... actually  I remember thinking that the substantial bun was well-paired with the chosen internals.  Overall, I was digging the Kalbi sliders...  I wonder now if a -tiny- bit of mayonaisse could have been added to the bun.  Mayo would have definitely made the flavor profile more reminiscent of the teri-beef burgers you get at local drive-ins in Hawaii. Now for the Beef & Cheddar slider:  A person who likes fresh colors and contrasting textures might find this slider too one-dimensional.  Before I picked it up, I was expecting it to be a greasy slog, but instead I was pleasantly surprised at how well the buttery croissant had held it's saucy fill.  The beef was something like you'd find in a traditional philly steak, thin-cut, chopped, lean and well-done.  It had been topped with what I'm guessing was the bechamel cheese sauce from the sold-out mac & cheese slider.  The sauce was rich!  After two of these bad boys I was feeling _HEAVY_.  All items at the Slider Truck are made to order, and that's a good thing because any more than the few minutes between pick-up and consumption would turn the Beef & Cheddar slider into a funky, soggy mess.I'm going to give three stars today, because my order was fresh and flavorful.  I'd like to revisit the Slider Truck when it's serving up it's full menu, plus a couple tasting items.  There's definitely some big-time potential here, but for $3 per item, I think they owe it to their patrons not to hold anything back.Cash only.
5	Are you freakin Kidding me.. A truck that serves sliders, yep it's true. I stopped by first Friday yesterday to check out some art and local goods. As we are walking up after parking we both said, " man something smells ridiculously delicious".  "POW" like an action bubble in the old school batman show the slider truck was in our faces. The stage had been set by recommendations so I had no choice but to get down on a few sliders. I ordered 2 pep pep sliders. Now just let me say, I am a big fan of sauces to add a little zing to things. But these sliders came with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sauteed onions, with a small amount of super sauce.  This is one of the only burgers I have had that I can honestly say could have been done without any sauce whatsoever. Everything was delicious, the meat was perfectly cooked and juicy.  I am still having trouble believing I had 2 small masterpieces out of the side of a truck. The comic reference is very fitting because it really was a huge "POW"  with every bite. I recommend tailgating this truck until it stops and get yourself some grub.
4	Pretty.damn.good! I have to give the owner props . He's young, he's bold, and he's got a fun, quirky concept that I think will appeal to the masses !Pep Pep - Basically a mini perfect bacon cheeseburger. I've eaten many a slider in my day, but I really loved this for the crazy amount of components (veggies, bacon, cheese, AND sauce all on a slider? SWEET).Caprese -Could have used a little more balsamic and the wheat bread wasn't as yummy as the white bread. Overall decent. Kalbi - YUM. Creative and tasty. Tons of meat and quite the flavor. The pieces we were served weren't chewy at all (at least for kalbi, that is)Why only 4 stars? $3 for a tiny sandwich out of a truck I need to eat in a freaking parking lot is pricey no matter how gourmet these sliders are. Considering most people need to buy them in sets of at least 2, I'd love to see him offer a 2/$5 type of pricing structure.  I could see guys needing 3 of these to fill up, and $9 for a meal out of a truck (with no sides or drink mind you!) is a little hard to swallow. Overall creative, fun, and yummy. I love it ! Can't wait to try some of the other flavors. In case the owners are reading this - I'd also love to see the flavors of the day added to their social network feeds. It would be nice to know what the choices are before leaving home!
5	These sliders are awesome!  The owner, Ric, is super cool and remembers you the next time you come.  At least, that's what happened with me.  Got sliders, went back a couple of weeks later, and he remembered me.  I'm hooked for life.  I try to make it out every other week or so, and the great part about the truck is that they're always on the move all over Vegas, so you never have to go too far to grab some sliders if you plan for it.  Make sure you follow them on Twitter for great promotions!
4	Another great place I've discovered as a result of my fellow Yelpers. After just finding out about the Koji Korean BBQ taco trucks in the Southern California area, I was pleased to find out high quality street food has found its way to Las Vegas, this time, in the form of succulent mini, square shaped burgers. As me and my co-worker pulled up to the truck, posted in the West-side Yogurtland plaza, we were surprised to see about 10-15 people standing and waiting for their orders, as it was relatively late in the evening. I ordered the Captains Order, Pep Pep and the Pulled Pork sliders. I was looking forward to trying the Kalbi sliders, but they were sold out. Bummer, next time. After putting in my order, the cook/owner turned to me and asked how we had heard about them, to which I replied "Yelp.com". He then stopped his burger flipping, walked over, shouted "YEAAHHHH! YELLLPPERSSSS!" and gave me a fist bump." How awesome is that? Now granted we came about 30 minutes before they were closing up, the food took a bit long, as they were backed up and actually ran out of some supplies (Probably a good sign!), but kept up updated on the status of the food and was sincere with their apologies. When I got my food, I anxiously devoured them up and I can say they are damn good. First thing I noticed off the bat was the freshness of the ingredients, specifically the meat. Big, thick piece of Angus beef in each slider, with an interesting foray of vegetables and dressings. I didn't really see anything on the menu other than about a choice of 6-7 sliders, not even hot prepared sides, which I do wish they had. Not having some sort of fried potato leaves me with an empty feeling, although they did have chips for sale. Overall, I love the concept, the quality and freshness of the ingredients and the boldness of these trendy entrepreneurs, I really would like to see them succeed. Add some more sides!
5	An all-around awesome truck and great idea. The sliders are quite tasty! Lots of flavor and quality ingredients. Met up with the truck last night with a friend at the Flamingo and 215 Yogurtland. They advertised on Twitter that the first 30 customers would get a coupon for free yogurt at Yogurtland... so naturally I was there early.. gotta have coups! From the start the truck is pretty cool, colorful and easy to understand the menu and how things work. Small selection of chips, candy and drinks as well as a menu of 6 different sliders. Prices are 1 for $3, 2 for $5, 3 for $7. A great deal at 3 for $7! To start we ordered 2 for $5 to try it out. I got the pep-pep and my friend got another one. There was a few people ahead of us and they cook to order so it took a few minutes but the wait was worth it. The burgers are fresh and delicious. We enjoyed so much we went up and got 3 more. I tried the Porkie and the BBQ one can't remember the name. The pulled pork was very good and very flavorful. There were photographers taking pictures for different magazines and papers including City Life which we may get a picture in! The staff was all very nice and very grateful for the business. They had a nice little crowd of people and steady flow. The girl that took the orders was very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to another visit to these guys soon.Oh, and they have Mexican Cokes in their cooler! Definately a huge plus! Don't drink soda much anymore but couldn't resist.They came thru on the promise for free yogurt as well. We received a coupon with each order for a free 5 oz yogurt at Yogurtland (check for my Yogurtland review next). But sliders and yogurt, a great combination. Hope they do that more often! Definately looking forward to another visit to the Slider Truck.One downside it seems is that they have become so popular so fast that they run out of food pretty early on occassion. Last night when I got home I saw on Twitter they were almost out and would be closing at 9 instead of the scheduled 11pm. Bummer if you were planning to go late.
4	Yay for trucks with good cheap food! Very reminiscent of the awesome taco trucks in California. I was quite sad when they only had a couple sliders left because they ran out of the others :( All the ingredients and simplicity of the sliders were amazing. The people running this cool truck were great. I will gladly be on the look out for them whenever I'm driving around town. I also look forward to trying everything on their menu.This is a must-try! I guarantee you will be wanting more :D
4	I am a definite fan!  I have been following them on twitter for the past few days trying to find a convenient time/location to stop by and finally caught them tonight.  I tried everything on tonight's menu (pulled pork, barbi, pep pep, captains order, and one more that I can't remember).  i recommend the pulled pork, which is saying a lot because I don't tend to like pork sandwiches, but the jalapenos give it a must try kick.I can't wait to try more!
5	So I read about the slider truck here and ended up driving across town last night to check it out.  Dude asked where we'd heard about the truck and when we said "Yelp," we got the "what's up Yelpers!" and the fist bump.Ordered a "pep pep" and the pulled pork.  Wow, they make a good slider!  Sometimes when you order burgers at other places, all you can taste is the cheese or the bun or the meat, but not here.  There's a good balance of ingredients with these sliders that make for a really tasty overall experience.Pricing is $3 for one, $5 for two, $7 for three. I like the truck's vibe and love the comic-style artwork on the truck.  Do yourself a favor and check this truck out!
4	Finally caught up with the truck on my last trip to town.  Super cool people & really yummy sliders (tried the Barbie & Captain's Order).
5	AND they get the 5th star for the kalbi slider.  nom nom x100.
5	that pulled pork man... with extra jalapenos....... weeeooohhhweeeeemy first time going to the truck they served two burgers on a small tray..... this time i got 4 burgers on a large tray, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat??????!!!really though, this is some good slider ackshun!
5	Came here with Angela and the BF for the slider truck/Retro Bakery Johnny Cupcakes thing. Retro weren't selling cupcakes but just handling Johnny. Disneyland line for shirts- no thanks.Slider Truck did not disappoint so I did not mind that I didn't get my cupcake crack. Go the Barbie, Yaya, kalbi rib and the pulled pork.  The patty on the sliders are juicy and a bit pink the way I like em. Nice balance of flavors and ingredient portions. I particularly like the bun- it's more like a soft egg buns you get at Asian bakeries than typical burger buns.BF and I liked the Barbie a lot. I liked the kalbi next- nice sweet yet savory marinade. It would be awesome if you can get it spicy style with some shredded kimchee on it. BF liked the Yaya as his second choice- it is fresh flavors in it with the feta and tzatziki. Pulled pork was good to me but BF felt it was a bit chewy- I liked the flavors though.They got moved twice so bless em for handling their business with patience. I seriously had half a mind to be like- hey park at my house a few blocks away! I'll put this out there- we actually have parking lanes in our neighborhood for all the fans to park and my neighbors don't care if a truck is in my driveway. *hint, hint NW stop location* I saw a Monte Cristo on the site- I wish I could get one of those sometime! Definitely I'll drop in next time it's closer to my neck of the woods and can't wait til next week for some more Slidin Thru stalking.Slider Truck is to Vegas is what Kogi truck did to LA- have the balls to be first, do their specialty well and handle the biznatch of the business of being mobile. I admire that definitely and wish this truck well. Hopefully one day Vegas can be as welcoming as LA is to the trucks. At the very least if the po-po and the cranky po-po calling businesses show no love, the peoples got lots of love to be patient and move where you go.
5	Haven't eaten here yet, as soon as a group of 5 of us walked up they were down to 1 slider. The guy working the truck insisted that we take some drinks or chips and sent us home with some coupons for free sliders. Wow, service like that doesn't really exist anymore. You know you have me hooked Slider Truck...GO SLIDER TRUCK GO!!!  LIVE THE DREAM!!!
1	One word...pissed?I was so excited to go to the Slider Truck today after work - I am in the neighborhood....so I decided to walk!  Yeah, it is cold and windy, but I thought it would be worth it!  I stood outside at the street corner in the cold crazy wind for 45 minutes, and Slider Truck did not show.  I walked all around the area, but no truck.I just checked the web site, and it still says by UNLV 6-8, so maybe they have the wrong time zone?  Now I have no dinner, I am disappointed, and I have somewhere to be at 7.I hate when there is so much hype and then such a let down!!  What ever happened to punctuality?  This thing only operates a few hours a day!Sigh.UPDATE: thanks for everyone who sent me negative messages because of this.  I do not have Internet on my phone nor do I have the ability to stare at twitter or facebook at work.  I checked the slidinthru.com web site's weekly schedule and it never changed so let me update the review when I actually try it!  THANKS!  I promise my review doesn't affect you.
5	LOVE THIS follow on twitter as well
5	Why are your burgers so good? Why!? Stella!!!Like a lion stalking his gazelle, the hunt for your food is a joy in itself. I found my prey coyly hiding in the back of a parking lot. And the time was right, so I pounced at opportunity to savor the meat of victory!None of this wimpy meat on a bun that I can inhale in one bite. These were true sliders and this is why the Slider Truck's cuisine reign supreme. I have to eat my sliders with two hands. Huge. I like how my hamburger meat is juicy, thick and pink in the middle. The toppings are discernable and tasty. The bacon is thick and smokey. And finally, $7 for three sliders is a steal.So with a full belly, my clan will rest up until our hunger strike and the hunt is back on.
5	I just went down  to Frankie's Tiki Room where they had set up shop and order myself 3 sliders, I was beyond hyped. I drank a Dr. Pepper, which, for some reason caused mild hallucinations but I was pretty stoked on that. The rad thing is that now instead of charging 3 bucks a slider they have a different pricing system : 2 for 5 bucks or 3 for 7 bucks. All in all pretty sweet time had in the parking lot of Frankie's.
5	Not sure what the afterlife holds for me, but I do know that if I am a good little boy, the Slider Truck will be there waiting for me.Man oh man, me oh my, this truck is the apple in my eye.Before I left for the truck, I followed it on Twitter, expressed my desire to have my face, soul and hunger melted. They gave me a retweet shoutout within minutes. I appreciate that kind of love.I had the Pep Pep, Pulled Pork and the Barbie. Effing amazing. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The accompanying ingredients were solid, but the best part is the guy that runs the truck.He is so passionate about his business, engaging with every single person that comes up to the truck, and he truly LOVES what he does with his job. Being the only legit gourmet food truck in town, I feel inspired to bring meals on wheels. If only I had a plan....In any case, worth the trip. And to my LA friends reading this...I'll put this up against any LA food truck. And yes, I've been there. Need I remind you all that I take credit for introducing Kogi to the friend circle.I know my food. Enough of this review. Go. Eat. Now.
5	I'm sold, those little burgers are kick a$$
5	Thank you yelpers for this fantastic find.  Would never have experienced it without you guys. Cleanliness, great service, reasonable prices and portions, and of course, fantastic food.  Burgers available: Barbie, Pep pep, and the pulled pork.  All awesome. My fav thus far is the Barbie: smokey BBQ angus beef with sizzling bacon, melted cheddar and bits of jalepenos. Yum yum yum.Price: 1 for $3, 2 for $5 and 3 for $7.  All worth it.  What makes this food spot so appealing as well are the "specials of the day". What new burger is going to be featured next?
5	Love these guys they came to feed the Yelp crew after the No Aids Walk. The Sliders were all they were advertised to be Pulled Pork knocked it out of the park. All I can say is come early come often and bring plenty of napkins. P.S. There is talk of homemade frites with spice coatings and shaker bags. Hope I'm not letting out any secrets.
5	UYE After AIDS Walk Party at Frankies Tiki with the truck Slidin' Thru. Had Barbie, Pep Pep and Pulled Pork only available. Ran out of pork by the time the BF showed up to grub with me. He didn't walk...he donated though because he felt bad. Sucker just got to do all the fun stuff. Barbie is my favorite. I eyed a Siracha hot sauce bottle in the truck so Ricardo hooked me up with some. MMMM....I just love the crispy onions on the bottom and the combo of that and bbq sauce and bacon and beef and cheesy goodness....EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!First time having Pep Pep- I like that the sauce has a bit more "zing" that most joints pink special sauce giving its own flavor take on the "classic" burger. So nice, I went twice. Once with the BF with 2 sliders each. Then later, we got the whole family in on it with a cameo from mom-in-law and grandma who came to try out the sliders and I grabbed another one from their order. Another family winner! They enjoy when they get to try new things because of us, but they don't often repeat the spot on their own. They don't know what the hell Twitter is, but she said if I can tell them when its near them so they can go. That's success- momma and grandmom approved. Now onto the peeps of Sliding Thru...Mom and G-Ma wanted to down their sliders in their car and head out so we sat with them a while. One of the guys on the grill came by to ask how everything was and saw I had an empty plate and offered to take it to the trash since there was one where he was going. That was really nice, he didn't have to do that. Ricardo is a cool guy and was glad I got to talk to him today a bit more about his business and talked about future slider flavors and randomness. Much luv, brother.Slidin' Thru- You're making a lot of people happy.UPDATE 5/8- Strolled into the Spring Valley Park and ordered 10 sliders and some sweet potato fries. I think it's very important to say why....so tomorrow the mom in law and I are busy working so no mothers day time for dinner. We wanted to have a mini pre mothers day love and what was the pick? Slider Truck. The Grandma in particular was so happy about it...she wanted some more Pep Pep and mom cant get enough of the Barbie! I finally tried the Captains Order and I like though could use a tiny bit more balsamic.Yeah- that's legit when mommas and grandmommas are picking this for mothers day.Props to Ric, he remembered my name too and I only introduced myself once.   :-)
4	I tried the veggie sliders and thought they were fantastic! You can't beat the friendly service you receive which always makes everything taste better. My only complaint is that they didn't have the fryer working so I wasn't able to try the fries.Come back to my office soon (Cirque du Soleil off paradise)!
5	Finally, street food in the desert!  I've lived in Vegas longer than I'd like to admit, and one of my biggest complaints is the lack of Mom & Pop restaurants and street food.  Fortunately, more independent restaurants have been popping up.  I hope this trend creeps into the arena of street delicatessens.  Although I don't typically eat red meat, I decided to try the Pulled Pork and Pep Pep.  Both were amazing!  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked.  The buns were crisp and all the ingredients were fresh!  I caught them outside of Stussy near UNLV, but sadly they had to cut out early due to a complaint from Ferraro's restaurant manager.  Who knew a slider truck was competing with a high end Italian restaurant.  Will definitely be back again.
5	They've changed their pricing structure for the better ($3/1, $5/2, $7/3). I recommend buying 3 - I promise you won't think "man this was a bad idea", unless you eat like a bird! $7 for a delicious, unique lunch. I can handle that ! Now that I've tried a few, my favorite is the pulled pork! I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's the best pulled pork sammie I've had in the city of Las Vegas! I had one yesterday and I'm already hitting refresh on the slidinthru website to see where I can buy another today. MMMAfter pulled pork, my next favorite is kalbi, followed by pep pep. Barbie and caprese are good, but not top 3 material ! Props again to the owner for bringing fun food to Las Vegas! I'd love to see some new items in the future - as long as he doesn't take away my pulled porkie !
2	I was excited and perplexed when I heard of Vegas' first gourmet food truck.  I spend a lot of time in LA and NYC and go out of way to find my favorite trucks and to check out new ones.The slidin' thru truck is decorated very cool, comic-book panel-like.  I tracked it down in a Bank of America parking lot.  There were a few people there, but not many more than the crew I had assembled to meet up at the spot.  I was curious to see if the gourmet truck thing that has taken LA and SF by storm had a chance here.  This city is such a driving town, not many places where there is a high density of locals where a truck would be able to park.Anyways...  they had a surprisingly big crew scrambling in the kitchen.  The truck was clean and appealing in design.  I couldn't wait!Unfortunately I had to.  First, they were out of 2 of the 4 or 5 sandwiches they serve.  That was a bummer.  Once I ordered though the bummer got even bummier.  Took like 10-15 minutes to get the food.  There were more cooks back there than customers?  What gives?  My friends got there before me and ordered and were still waiting well after I arrived, parked, perused the menu and ordered.Well, if the food is killer it's worth it, thought I.  Finally got the grub.  Looked good.  It wasn't bad at all, just not that great.  I'd rather drive through one of the many In-N-Out outposts than wait in an out of the way parking lot for just okay food.  Bun was a little stale.  Meat was seasoned well, but kinda dried out.  They obviously were sand-bagging patties back there, so why did it take so long for 3 cooks to put it together?I really have high hopes for the slider truck and any future trucks who take to the streets of LVNV, but I just can't love it because I know how good it could be and  it wasn't bad, but there are lots of good fast-food burgers a lot more convenient and a lot better.  Give me a Fatburger any day over the slidertruck.  I hate to say it.  I really do, but this one was a definite "meh"...
5	Excellent. It came up to Summerlin so I dragged my mom and a friend. We got three sliders, one for each of us. The total was seven bucks. My mom is far from a gourmet, so she got the most basic burger and enjoyed it. I had the Pep Pep, which has mixed greens, feta, balsamic reduction and grilled onions. Amazing, you would never expect this came from a truck. My friend had the pulled pork and gave a good review of that as well, but I cannot say as pork is obviously not kosher. A nice touch was the gummy burger candy the worker gave us with our order. I really enjoyed that, it's a nice touch.I hope it comes back around here again soon, but Slider Truck seems to prefer Henderson.
5	YAY, Vegas has a food truck the likes of those in LA! Maybe I don't need to drive 4 hours for the food truck goodness =)When I found that there was a food truck in Vegas through Twitter, I was allllll about itttttttttt!!!!! I kinda hinted to Slider Truck that I was gonna "slide thru" one day and even though I already ate a full meal, I went to look for it anyways. And it did not disappoint! THANK GAWD!!! lolI had the Barbie and Pep..unsure of what the ingredients were but, it was sooooooooooo ONOOOOOOOOOO =)=)=) I wish I had bought 2 of each =( I WISH WISH WISH they had the kalbi sliders but, there is always a next time to SAMPS that!The owner, Ricardo, was really fun and knew me thru Twitter. I'm telling you...all food trucks will live on through Twitter! And with fun owners like him...customers will always "slide thru...." (ok ok enough with these "slider" puns :p)SAMPS THE SLIDER TRUCK!!!!
5	Checked out their website (www.slidinthru.com) for their location, and they were about a 5 minute drive from the strip so we headed to meet them.The menu looked so great we ordered one of each!  They also made some custom, cheese & lettuce sliders for the kids. My favorites were the Kalbi Rib, Captain's Order, and the Barbie. But I do have to say the veg one was also a winner.   The buns were a perfect match, and they were grilled to perfection.   This was the best (and by far the cheapest) meal we've had in Vegas (this certainly blew away the crappy lunch buffet we had on the strip). I've had sliders at many different restaurants around the country, and these were by far the best!
5	OK, I'm jumping on the bandwagon (or slider truck in this case) and giving them 5 stars. I finally had the chance to check them out the other night. I arrived a little early to beat the crowd and I wasn't the only one with that idea. It was funny to see several people waiting in their cars. Who would ever think that a slider truck would cause so many people to wait in an empty lot for its arrival. I wasn't sure what to get so I ended up getting 5 different sliders and an order of sweet potato fries. Here's how I would rank them from best to pretty good:1. Pep Pep -- I love the sauce. It was like a Thousand Island type of sauce. It added so much depth to the beef, onion and bacon.2. Kalbi -- It had a wonderfully sweet taste to it, but the meat could have been a bit more tender.3. Barbie -- Love the bbq sauce!4. Yaya -- The feta and tzatziki sauce with the patty was a good combo, kinda like a gyro.5. Captain's Order -- A little overcooked. Compared to the other sliders this one just didn't have the same wow factor, but still a solid burger.The sliders were bigger than I thought they would be. The patties are thick and 2 or 3 are probably enough to fill up most people. Luckily I had my wife and kid to help me finish all five. Then of course we also had the sugar coated sweet potato fries which were delicious. All of that only cost $15. That's one of the best bargains you'll find anywhere in the city. Where else can two adults eat a satisfying meal for $15? And I'm not counting fast food chains because this food is far superior.I didn't have the chance to try the pulled porkie (they were all out) but I'll definitely track them down again for another round. They not only have the best sliders in town, but burgers that are just as good, if not better than, many of the upscale burger joints around.
3	Great food and service, but fall short in other areas.The Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork are all delicious and for $7 its just a great value. Just enough to fill you up for lunch, but not enough for dinner.  Combine with the very friendly service that you can only get from a locally owned business, this would get a 5 star right? Nope, there are some issues.First, the cinnamon fries at $3 is pricey for what you get. I was disappointed to see them use frozen Ore-Ida. When your competition In-N-Out is using potato that is cut in the store and your using frozen potatoes, just disappointing. There is just a difference between frozen potatoes and fresh ones. I rather get animal style fries and have some change left even though I'm a big supporter of the locally owned businesses. Another issue is that you have no idea what the offering is for a certain day. They might be offering their 6 regular items, they might only have half the menu available, etc. Today when I came, they only had the Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork. Lucky for me, I checked Twitter right before I came. Had I  wanted one of the other 3 and didn't check Twitter before, I would have been disappointed. I know everyone and their grandma has a smartphone, but at least be considerate to your non-smartphone customers like Lisa L. A simple sign showing whats available for the day on the truck could easily fix this.The biggest issue with this place is the wait time. 25 mins from the time of ordering is just ridiculous. I could see 10 to 15 minutes, but not 25 minutes. There was about 5 people ahead of me, which added another 10 - 15 minutes wait time before I can even order.  So from the time I arrived, till I got my first bite was about 35 minutes. I know this isn't fast food, but really? I don't even think this was considered busy. Imagine how bad it would have been if it was actually busy. I hope you have 1 hour to spare because thats how long you'll need. Now I know why the lines are so long...Great sliders, but they need to work out their communication issues, frozen fries, and the wait time. Until then, its not worth me driving out of my way just to get these sliders.
4	Wow people are crazy about slider truck!  And you know what there is a good reason why.  Damn good food and a fun atmosphere.  For everyone that has spent time in Austin especially during SXSW you know that while you are in town some of the best food comes from the gourmet mobile trucks around town.  Slider Truck is the first thing in Vegas that is similar.  You might be thinking "Isn't this just a roach coach that gives laborers heart burn"?  Answer: no!  The big difference is Slider Truck is manned by three 20 somethings that have a simple menu with gourmet ingredients.  When I visited Slider Truck they had a simple menu of 5 different types of burgers (even a vegetarian option).  I picked 3 and unfortunately 2 of them were unavailable because they had run out of a key ingredient (in my case this was Korean beef bar b q and pork).  The food is cooked to order so be prepared to wait. This isn't a bad thing per se as there are tons of people hanging out in the same boat but, all have really good attitudes and most of them are focused on telling their friends via facebook or twitter about what they are doing.  You see Slider Truck isn't just food it's created it's own social and cultural following.  Seeing as how this is Yelp lets talk about the food.  For 3 sliders and an orange fanta I paid $9.  It was worth it in my opinion without a doubt.   The Captain's Order burger was tasty and the different elements blended well. The Barbie had a unique kick with the caramelized jalapeno which added a fun if not surprising flavor in every bite (I must admit it is a bit spicy so be forewarned). Finally the Pep Pep which tasted more like an average burger with the super sauce and caramelized onion rounding out the flavor.I gave slider truck 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I got there an hour after they setup in the location and they were already out of the specials.  There wasn't a huge line and they even admitted to just being not prepared. Sorry perfect ratings goto the guys that are perfect!  I would recommend Slider Truck to friends and am sure I will frequent them again and again and again....
5	To quote Britney Spears (I think)  "Gimme gimme more, gimme more"Just thought I would add that to my previous review. Hats off to these guys for becoming an instant success out here. Well done! Look forward to new menu items and longer hours. Read a post on twitter the other day from them saying they are working on finding ways to combat there sudden popularity because they keep running out of food. Hope they figure it out soon! It will only help business for them!Speaking of... I want to buy an ice cream truck and follow them around to all of their locations and sell ice cream and yogurt. My idea is to call it GO-GO GURT (since GOGURT is already taken).
4	I finally got to see what all the hype was about. Went there an night about an hour after they set up. They were out of their specials so (kalbi and pulled pork sliders) so I had to make due with their angus burger sliders.They were pretty good, similar to what you expect from an angus slider at a place like burger bar at Mandalay bay, but probably a bit cheaper. The main thing is the novelty of the idea of following around their truck and eating on a curb side with your friends.The only downsides were they were out of their specials which I wanted to try since while their angus sliders were really good, they're also good everywhere else you go to get a gourmet burger. The other was the really long wait (about 30 min) to get the food which in my opinion is a bit long to be waiting to get food from a truck.
4	Have been wanting to try the truck out and finally got to catch up with them at the Powder and Sun location. I wanna start off by giving major props to Ric for bringing street food to this town. He is a cool dude with a dream, and now the Slider Truck is its own phenomena.Got to the truck about an hour after they opened up shop and there was a small line and some people hanging out in the parking lot waiting for their orders. I checked the website to see what burgers they would have that day and was excited to try the three they had: Barbie, Porkie, and Pep Pep. After waiting for my food I was so excited to finally eat and it was worth the wait. I think my favorite was the Porkie, I love BBQ so it hi the spot. The Barbie was also great with the jalapenos and crispy onion straws. I would make the patties a little thinner and a little less done, but hey everyone has a different opinion on what is medium well and medium rare and everyone wants it done differently so the guys have to make them to appeal to huge lines they are getting.The thing I think people need to remember with the truck is this:1. They are still newborns. They have only been open for like a month and they want all feed back good or bad, no matter how small. They want to improve, most places don't give a damn what the customers think. They openly say "tell me what you think!"2. It's a service truck cooking made to order burgers. They want to do it right, and right when you order it. Cooking is an art so don't rush the 3-4 dudes cramped in the truck. 3. If you don't want to wait or chill in the parking lot this place is not for you. And there is so much buzz around it there are going to be crowds wanting five burgers at a time. 4. Use the Internet to your advantage. Their weekly schedule is on their site and twitter and facebook, so you need a computer to find where they are so take the time to see what the guys are cooking that day so you don't drive across town for a burger you don't want. Because someone else will eat it.Ric and the guys are nice and deliver great customer service, the food is yummy, and the experience is a new, and a great one for our city. Let's just enjoy some good food.
1	This NOT based off of the food... BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO TASTE IT. So, I heard about the Slider Truck and I immediately looked up the reviews and checked the schedule, since they're only in certain location at certain times, and the next closest location was going to be behind the Yogurtland on Flamingo and 215 this past Saturday, but I totally forgot about it until we were driving by and saw him in front of Massage Nirvana on Fort Apache in between Trop & Peace Way. Yea... That's NOT the location that was listed, 1st WHOOPS. We turned into the parking lot because I really wanted to try the sliders, I mean, how many places have you seen that have 4 1/2 stars? So we park and as soon as we walk up to the line and a guy that was waiting for his food, said that the Slider Truck ran out of food. WTH?! WHOOPS NUMERO DEUCE. I was really disappointed because he's not really on this side of town very much, at least from the looks of his schedule, and the photos look so good and a lot of the reviews were raving about the sliders. AND the schedule isn't updated til last minute. I checked his schedule yesterday, for today and it wasn't posted when I checked at 8pm last night. I STILL WANT to try your sliders Mr. Slider Truck... But some consistency as to where you're going to be and enough food for your fellow Las Vegans would be awesome :)
4	a gourmet comic inspired burger truck operated by a bunch of hipster / skater types.  the food is legit.  glass bottle cokes and fantas are a nice touch too.  1 slider = $3, 2 sliders = $5, 3 sliders = $7.  though, i question its sustainability due to its (lack thereof) marketing strategy.  twitter-ups are effective only to create a buzz; however eventually every business in order to grow needs to operate out of a brick and mortar.
4	I was so hungry when I visited the slider truck for the first time...so I think I should reserve a more detailed review for my next visit.Everything was made fresh to order KUDOSThey were out of a few of their options, but what I did try was great...the ingredients were fresh, made to order and full of flavor.
5	The sliders were great. Definitely worth it. This is waaaay beyond White Castle or Krystals, so leave those expectations at home. The sweet potato fries were also real good. I'll be looking out for them from now on. This is one of those "Vegas Things" you can have your friends try out when they come form out of town.  As most people would say, the service is great. They all had real good attitudes and seemed to really enjoy their work. If they were drones like most workers at fast food places, the place would lose some if its appeal. I would recommend everyone to try it out if they have the time.
4	Got the honorary fist bump upon being one of the first to order one day this past week.Really fun concept - I know Portland OR, LA, NY, etc... have more mature gourmet mobile food trucks - Slider Truck - welcome to Vegas and thanks for starting the energy in the gourmet mobile food truck movement here.Staff was very friendly, took a few minutes to prepare the order, but quality is worth waiting for.  Had the Pep Pep, Barbie, Porkie and a Cinco de Mayo special of carnitas with pickled onions and cotilla cheese.  All were really good, burgers were solid, Porkie and Cinco de Mayo special were really good - really wanted to try to Kalbi burger but no dice on this day.  Also - had an order of sweet potato fries - fresh, crispy, and sprinkled with vanilla sugar - awesome item.This is food worth going out of your way for - to meet up at one of their locations - lot's of fun, good food.  Slide on in....
4	I love food trucks. In Los Angeles, there has been a food truck explosion. The Slider Truck is as good if not better then some of the LA trucks.The sliders are fantastic. The sauce, the bread and the meat all work together to have a party in your mouth. Yummmm - mouth party!Only reason I can't give it five stars...the lines are long. I suggest you plan ahead and get there early.
5	I had my first taste of the Slider Truck at First Friday and both were great.  As we all know when everyone you know raves about something you're a little skeptical but I'm glad to say that Slider Truck met and exceeded any and all expectations.  I ordered the Pep Pep, Pulled Porkie, and Sweet Potato Fries.  The menu does vary according the day but everything is still made to order which is convenient for those of who love flavor but like it done our way.  All the ingredients were fresh and even the buns were filled with flavor.  The dessert for me was enjoying crisp and fresh Sweet Potato Fries with cinnamon.  Did I mention I had all of this for a sweet and delicious bargain of $8, certainly the best bang for your buck in town.
3	The concept and marketing approach are awesome, guys that run it are great and I'm happy they're killing it in LV.  I'm sure they'll do so for a long time.  But this is pretty much a one and done for me unless I know they're breaking out some of the crazy looking specials they got on their site like the montecristo.  Being 10th in line when they opened and having to wait 40 min is understandable but I'm not planning to do it again anytime soon.  My wife and I tried 5 of the burgers w/ the Pep Pep being by far and away the best one and the Barbie coming in 2nd.  Captain was dry and fries were fries.  For $9, I would rather just go to LBS for happy hour.
5	I checked the website and saw that on one of the days they would be near by my house so I anxiously waited for the day to come as it would be my first experience with Slider Truck. I arrived to the location about 30 minutes early which is no problem considering I was just studying in my car. 15 minutes later the truck arrives and then they started prepping, oh man did the aroma releasing from the truck smell good. First in line, I ordered the sweet potato fries, two Cinco De Mayo specials, Captain's order, Pep Pep, pulled porkie, and something else that was unbelievably delicious. I only waited for about 10 minutes or so to receive my food. Ricardo was very friendly and welcoming. Overall I enjoyed my experience and I am hoping for another round soon :)
5	The food here is great worth 4 to 4.5 stars, but it's a fun experience and great service so 5 stars it gets.Ok, I have eaten here three times and I am jumping on the band wagon.  Everything about this place rocks, the idea, the food, the prices, friendly service... just great, I even enjoy tracking them down.  The best slider hands down for me is the barbie, its a BBQ bacon slider the sauce is smokey and delicious, there are some spicy jalapenos, the meat is juicy and thick, the bacon is crisp, add some fried onions and you get awesomeness.  Once again there BBQ sauce rocks and the pulled pork slider is great too.  The service isn't lightning fast because everything is made to order but worth the wait.  The fries are cooked fresh and are real good too.The best thing is you can mix and match your order so you can get 3 different types of sliders for lunch.  Variety is the spice of, well lunch in this case.
4	FINALLY TRIED THEM!!! I had family in town and they had no interest in visiting the strip so we planned to do tons of local things, this was one of them! Since out first attempt at the sliders was a complete failure and coupled with the fact that I was super anxious to try the sliders, I planned to be at the location listed, Spring Valley Park on 5/8/2010, at least 30 mins ahead. OK, not to sound like a total geek, we took our pup to the dog park while we waited, so it was like a 2fer, pup gets to play, while we wait for the munchies :) I felt like I was 5 years old again, when I saw the slider truck pulling up, I was SO excited, ridiculously so! We get into line and the Slider Guy started setting up. He was really nice and even asked us how we heard about him, I said "Yelp" he was so excited when I said that because, well, I guess Yelp is where he gets a lot of his business, GO YELP! :) I also think that the truck fits the personality of the slider truck guy. When you meet him, you'll know what I mean... So, you place your order, wait for your number to be called and find a place to sit, luckily we were at a park, so there were plenty of park benches to park our rears. We ordered a total of 12 sliders, for 3 people, which btw is too much for 3 people, I only ate 2, my son had 3 and my husband had 4 so we went home with 3 left over. Pep peps, capreses, and I don't remember what the others were because, well, I got too full before I could eat them lol and my brother ordered a bag of fries for all of us to share. As small as the sliders are, they are SOOO filling. They're all full of flavor and everything is made with such quality. The fries are seasoned and weren't as bad as some of the reviews that I've seen.So I have a couple suggestions: 1.The sliders all have such tasty sauces and kinda get all over your hands, all he has are wet naps, so bring a few napkins it'll assist with the clean up. 2. If you have no intention of sitting in your car or parking your booty on the curb to eat your food, I suggest that you bring some chairs. He provides the food and service, not really a place to sit. lol REHEAT VALUE: My husband thought that they taste better the next day, personally, I don't. I have no palette and he does, um, let me know who's right :)
5	Finaly was able to catch up to them and try them only thing I can say this is the real deal the sliders were amazing caught up to them at first Friday they had 4 tvdt night so I had to have all 4 pulled pork was delcious BBQ sauce is jus perfect in flavor plane Jane was tasty and moist defintly worth tracking down and eating can't wait to try thr kalbi rib slider
4	These guys who run the truck are great! They had an idea and literally rolled with it.3 sliders for $7. Great price. The kalbi and pulled pork sliders go fast! By the time I got there and waited in line for about half an hour they were all gone!I ordered everything else on the menu! The meat needs more seasoning, and I'm not a big fan of the bun, but I'll forgive and forget. I am a big fan. Love the concept, so much so I waited more than  an hour to get my food out in the cold.
5	In the middle of a slammed First Friday crowd, Captain of the Slider Truck remembered my previous visit, and knew my name off my Yelp review. Fucking astonishing, because I can't remember where my shoes are in the morning most days. Food was excellent, again. I had the sweet potato fries and that was delicious, I also really liked the Barbie.My friends who ditched me after I waited through that line for them? Not cool, dudes, not cool.
4	Awesome sliders, worth a trip if they're in your area, just be ready for a bit of a wait :)Only 4 or 5 orders were ahead of me and it took a good 25 minutes to get my sliders, which dings them one star, otherwise they'd be 5 star all the way :)The meat was cooked very well, and all the toppings were fresh and tasty. I've only tried the basic Pep Pep so far, but I definitely want to go back and try more of the menu.
5	After a day of walking with the wife and feller Yelpers at the AIDS Walk in downtown Las Vegas, we all got a chance to eat from the Slidin' Thru truck.  This ingenious group of 3 guys who graduated from the CIA of Las Vegas decided to open their own business, riding on a popular trend of food trucks serving unique foods that was sparked up in the Los Angeles area.  My past experiences on these trucks were pre-made sandwiches, and tacos al-pastor (one of my favorites).   This truck only focuses on one type of food product...sliders.  Ricardo was one of the fellers that took our orders and told us about the food and their business.  That day the menu was limited to only three selections: the Pep-Pep, the Barbie, and the Pulled Porkie.  The wife and I decided to order all 3 choices and double up on the Pep-Pep.  My eyes could not stop gazing at the 4 sliders piled high with generous amounts of meat topped with light brown toasted puffy buns.   The Pulled Porkie was filled with layers of stewed juicy and tender pulled pork.  For the other burgers, I wanna say about  to 1/3 lb amount of ground meat cooked to about a medium, so the meat was very moist.  The Barbie was a burger that was covered with cheese and bacon , but was overpowered by the bbq sauce.. The Pep-Pep is what I wanted to focus my taste buds on  because it is the classic burger, the most simplest of them all the menu.  If someone can't make that right, then they don't know what they are doing at all.  The verdict: the Pep-Pep was completely amazing.  When I sunk my first bite into this burger, my mouth felt the texture of the soft toasted bun, then the gooey cheese, and crispy thick bacon, and finally the moist burger.  My mouth lit up because I could actually taste how well seasoned the meat was and how the homemade thousand island, salty bacon, pepper-jack cheese, the lettuce, and tomato completed the whole slider, nothing was overpowering.  Since then, I have came back for more of the Pep-Pep, and looking forward to try the new items.
4	We just hit up the slidin thru truck at the Liberace Museum and had great time.  We tried one of each of the sliders available today.  A+ on the different meats and sauces, I like them all.  The atmosphere is also awesome, chatted with several people in line. The guys who run the truck are so sweet and friendly. We will be back for more!   My only one tiny gripe is the bun they use, i like a thinner bun like White Castle serves, they use a roll type bun that is too much bread for me, but don't let that stop you from enjoying these awesome burgers and fun experience! Next time we will try the fries too, I heard they are "screamin" from the gentleman behind me in line.
5	Another trip to the Slider Truck today! Some updated notes:*Had Yaya for the first time. F-ing amazing!!!!!!! Dare I say I might like it better than Pep Pep? I'm a feta girl and this slider is heavenly ! *They got an A rating this morning from the Health District, good for them!*Ric gets major points for customer service. We ordered some sweet potato fries. They were tasty but not up to snuff. I didn't complain as they were busy and honestly I was still eating them so who cares. Ric randomly called me over 10 minutes later and hands me a fresh bag of fries and says "I noticed the first order I gave you didn't look so great - here's a better order on the house". So there you have it. I didn't even complain but he's so on top of quality control he rectified the situation !  I love you Ric and your ridiculously good sliders !!!
5	I finally got to experience the Slider Truck and I am so glad the boyfriend decided to surprise me with it, because YUM!He ordered 3 burgers for himself, and I got 2 vegetarian eggplant burgers, sweet potato fries, and a large bottle of water. The total was $17 for the two of us, not shabby! Didn't take all that long to actual get the food but whatever wait we had was totally worth it. Matt has said in the past that the eggplant caprese sliders were his least favorite but we all know that boys don't know anything ;) I actually dislike eggplant, there are very few dishes I like with that bulbous purple veggie (maybe I get too many Coneheads flashbacks!) but these little sliders were delicious. The eggplant was nice and hot, and the cheese, tomato, basil, and sauce were nice and cold giving it a refreshing quality to it. I'm usually a slow eater but I devoured the hell out of these babies. The sweet potato fries were pretty good although I wish there was a little bit of salt in there - I love a salty/sweet mix with a lot of foods and I think that would have taken them to be over-the-edge awesome. I can see why this truck has so many devotees and I am definitely going to be one of them from now on. It is completely worth the wait, the customer service is great and there is just an overall aura of happy around this truck. I hope it stays around for a long time and that maybe more veg-friendly items get brought into existence, but for now I will enjoy my eggplant and fries like crazy!
4	Ok, I finally tried out the Slider Truck today.  They were on my side of town, so everything fell into place.I was surprised when I went to the window to order...Rick recognized me.  It kind of shocked me when he called me by name...he must have been monitoring the Twitter account, because that was the only way he could have known I was coming because we've never met.  Anyway, that was impressive.I ordered the Barbie & the Pep Pep.  While I was waiting for my food, I noticed that most of the people who were there were repeat customers.  They have done a great job of promoting their business via social networking.After a short wait my food was ready.  I couldn't wait to try it out.  I first attacked the Barbie....it was very tasty and fresh.  It didn't take me long to devour it.  The BBQ sauce and jalapeno peppers went well together.  The Pep Pep was next....and it was even better.  I especially like the sauce.The only reason I didn't give them 5 Stars is because of the eating experience itself.  It was pretty windy and I was planning to eat in my car....but because of how messy the sliders are, I didn't want to get it all over my car or clothes, so I ate outside.  It wasn't very pleasant or ideal.  I understand that's how it works with food trucks, but I guess that's why I'm not a fan of most.  At least they give you wet wipes to clean up.Will I return?  If they're located nearby or relatively close, I will.  i won't drive to the other side of town for it.
5	Slidin Thru by my house! How can I not go?! Funny is that the G'ma was talking about how she loved it when we went last week and was wondering when will the truck will be close by either of our houses again. So I looked it up and saw it was NW TBA so we already had it planned for them to come over for some Slider Luv Saturday. That's legit- grandmas and mama's are part of the craze too. Remember, this was what they wanted for Mothers Day out of all the things we could have eaten and the g'ma declared it's her favorite thing to eat in Vegas. Awwwww...So I had TWO new sliders today. Yes, I havent had the Eggplant Caprese but I've been a little carnivorous monstoro lately. This was refreshing actually- very pleasant. I've been wanting eggplant lately so that helped that odd craving. Off menu today was a brisket slider. It had beef brisket with the BBQ sauce that is on my favorite, the Barbie. Sometimes brisket can be chewy, but this was not- a tender bite. Since we took this home I wanted to add some spice. Perfect zing was this Indonesian hot sauce called "Sambal Badjak" which is chili with onions/shallots in oil so its spicy and a bit sweet. AM-A-ZINGGG! I think I'll be bringing a bottle in my purse from now on if we eat at the truck.So we had the sweet potato fries last week and it was good with the sugar cinnamon sprinkle on it. This time it had a bit of salt with the cinnamon sugar so I think Ric was maybe reading our reviews again and saw Adina's and worked it in. (HI RIC!!) Anyways, I think with adding just the pinch of salt it was even better. Maybe some regular fries next to round out and try everything...but I like sweet potato fries so much though that I gotta hope I'm in the mood soon or someone is and I can pinch a few from them.Other than that- the same old. G'ma loves the Pep Pep, Scott, his mom and I like the Barbie. I love the Yaya 2nd, but wasn't on the menu today....is this gone for good? (noooo...!)Retro Bakery owners dropped by and brought Ric super chunky chip cookies. He shared a cookie with us. Sharing is caring and was really awesome of him. It was cooki'licious ! You know where I'm going next weekend for cookies and cupcakes! NW location is a good one. Where he parks in the NW is across the street from Retro Bakery (N. Durango and Farm) in the Albertsons parking lot. There is a big roundabout planter there where people can sit and enjoy their food. So yes, if you dont like standing- this location you can sit outside right by the truck.Sliders and bags of sweet potato fries (cookie and fist bumps too!)  made for a decent day. We had our dog LuLu pass on Thurs and she was our baby, our "heart dog".... this made me feel better after a devastating few days. I almost didn't go because I was planning to bring her to have a Plain Jane and take a picture of her eating it with her Yelp bib for the truck profile and it made me sad thinking Ric never met his unofficial pug mascot/patty connoisseur, but really glad I went. I know a burger is something simple, but sometimes the simple things are the things that start to make a difference.
5	3rd time yesterday... BBQ Beef Brisket is awesome! Def a must try when they do it as a special and the sweet potato fries were so tasty. As always awesome service! I want them to come to San Jose when I move.. I'm going to miss the Slider Truck
4	I've seen my friends reviews of this place and name mentioned time and time again. Finally I decided to keep track of their schedule and noticed they were going to be a block away from my Las Vegas office. I ended up mixing and matching the sandwiches with a side of the sweet potato fries. Two of the burgers and one of the pork sliders. All of them were good. The sauces definitely made these bites worth the cost. They are a little bit pricier but these kids have something down so I have no problem supporting them and their endeavors.Track them down before the Vegas heat gets too hot to be waiting around outside!
4	Did you know slider truck has a hidden menu??? You have to literally ask them before you order but, sometimes they have stuff! Today the example was the "French Dip" slider. The burger was great and the Au Jus was amazing.  This time around I had the sweet potato fries that everyone goes on about.  I didn't love them. Don't take this to mean they are bad they just aren't my thing as they were a little too sweet.As usual the service was super friendly and fun. The meal is more of an experience seeing as how you have to hunt them down but, this makes it more of an adventure and fun. Thats right I have to admit not following the same pattern/habit can be a good thing!
5	what?! twice in one week?! um.. yes. Stopped by while they were at SK&G Advertising by 215 and Russell. It was a bit tough to find thanks to Google Maps with the roads labeled wrong.I caught them at the tale end of their 3 hr stay and there were a few ppl around still. I got 2 porkies, 2 french dip (special), and a barbie. Not all for me don't worry. Anyways, I took them to go. I ate a porkie (finally got another one) and the 2 french dip (really good... lots of flavor).I'm going to miss these guys when I move! My favorite business in Las Vegas. Great food, great service and awesome concept. Hope to get a t-shirt before I move so I can rock it in San Jose (make it happen Ric! lol)
5	Amazing. If you haven't tried the slider truck you have to track the down. Every slider that I tried was fantastic. The pulled pork slider and the BBQ are definitely my favorite so far. Very friendly staff and with the price you can get your fill no problem. My question is when are they starting up a second truck???
4	Being able to catch the Slider Truck seemed nearly impossible for me with the schedule that I had. It was always either too far away, or out of my time frame. However, today was a little different. It was at a nearby location and within my lunch break. I wanted to fall to my knees and weep tears of joy when I got there. I finally made it.I ordered 2 Pep Peps with a side of sweet potato fries. Accompanying this meal, was a classic glass bottle of Coke.The sliders were rather small in diameter, but the thickness in the patties made up for it. All in all , fun sized morsels of deliciousness. The sweet potato fries tasted a bit like tiny churros with the cinnamon sugar sprinkled on it. Not bad. I don't think it went too well with the burgers though. It was more like a dessert to eat afterwards. Two sliders should be enough to fill a small hunger; Maybe order three if you arrive hungry.The food wasn't good enough for me to go out of the way for, but good enough for me to drop by whenever it's around. They offer super friendly service and a unique change of pace for the lunch scene. Mad props to the Slider Truck! You've got yourself a new fan.
5	i have been DYING to try the slider truck ever since i heard about it weeks ago from yelp.  finally went this evening and i can't wait to go again!i ordered the captain, the yaya and the pulled porkie.  they were out of the porkie so ric suggested the frenchie (french dip with great au jus), so i got that one.i am not cool enough to eat them outside (i was there by myself so it would have been boring) so i brought them home to eat.  i figured i might as well be comfortable while enjoying my long-awaited sliders!  it's a good thing i did too because if i had stayed i may have kept ordering sliders, and really, 3 was a perfect amount.i loooooved the captain and the frenchie, but my favorite was the yaya.  i'm a huge greek food fan anyway, so i knew i'd like it, but the tzaziki made it.  the cucumber flavor was so fresh and added a... brightness (?), i don't know... a wonderfulness that i loved.i will definitely be back - can't wait!  thank you slider truck!!!
5	It had been a while since my last visit to the Slider Truck, so another visit was long past due.  Early in the day I sent a text to a few friends asking if they wanted to hit up the Slider Truck; big mistake.  Have you ever had to go through an entire work day, with nothing but the Slider Truck driving through your head, dispensing those delicious burgers?  The anticipation was like going to Disneyland, except for my mouth.I got to do a repeat eat of my favorite from past visits, The Barbie, and also got to try two new sliders: the Captain's Order and the Frenchie.  The Barbie is still filled with awesome, with the carmelized jalapenos and bacon winning me over time and time again.  The Captain's Order was different for me; I had to try it because it wasn't on the menu last time.  It tasted like a really good salad on a really good burger.  Last up was the secret menu item for the day (which he revealed out of Yelp love!), the Frenchie, a hamburger bun hugging sliced beef tenderloin and provolone cheese together, coupled with an au jus dipping sauce.  When I received my order the first thing I noticed was how light the au jus was!  We're talking cloudy water type of transparency, as opposed to the typical dark color I'm used to.  But no nead to fear, Slider Truck was on top of things as usual and managed to pack unbelievable amounts of flavor into that au jus.  It was simply screaming "Dip ALL your burgers into me!"How could you do this to me Ricardo?  I still need to try your french fries.  And now I want to sign up for a Twitter account to see your updates.  I can't wait till my next visit!
5	Thanks, Yelp, for bringing the Slider Truck to my attention.  Weekly schedule showed them in the downtown area, my place of employment, so perfect for lunch.  I ordered the Barbie, Captain's order and Pulled Pork.  All delicious but I love feta so Captain's order was my fave.  We got there about an hour after they had set up shop and the wait from ordering to receiving the food was about ten minutes so I didn't think that was bad.  I don't know whether the fries were frozen or not but they were delicious and hot to me and I love the sweet cinnamon seasoning.  I'm already planning my return visit!
5	My love for the slider truck keeps growing and growing.... another day another great experience. All I have to say for this trip is... did the Porkies get bigger?! OMG - I ordered 4 sliders (3 porkies and a barbie) because I usually am still hungry after 3 especially since the porkies were not as filling. Yesterday however, the porkies were HUGE and I was full after 3.My first experience at the truck where I had to wait in line to order (15 minutes) and it wasn't bad. Went quick. It was a beautiful night out too which made it better.Only negative was the Lakers sign in the window lol Sorry Ric! haha
4	Tasty stuff my friends. We ordered a Barbie, a Captains Order, A Ya-Ya, and the Eggplant Caprese plus sweet potato fries. Pretty much the entire menu. The Sweet Potato Fries were outstanding. They were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and I felll in love. The burgers were all very good and unique. There is definitly something for everyone and it is nice having bugers that are a little 'out of the box' when it comes to unique topping combos. I'm not a big fan of eggplant but I destroyed the Caprese. The guys that run the truck have a great sense of humor and seemed really appreciative for all the customers that were seeking them out.My only gripe is that these are totally not sliders but mini-burgers. Maybe it's because I'm from the midwest surrounded by White Catle and other joints that steam the hell out of their sliders BUT these are still tasty little treats that are worth a vist.
4	Ordered the Pep Pep, Barbie, and Plain Jane.  Ahhh-mazing.  The combo of the angus beef mixed with the different flavors plus bite sized & affordable to get the most bang for your buck.  I'd recommend to all my friends that wouldn't be afraid to order from a "roach coach".
4	WOWI'm so glad I finally got to try this place!HELLA BOMB. Literally like an explosion in my mouth and it felt soo good!I only tried the BARBIE, but that was more than enough to make this place a tradition every time I visit Vegas. It was the hugest slider I've ever seen! Even the picture I took makes me drool. Sooo good!The only reason why I'm knocking off one star is cuz they RAN OUT OF FRIES! I was really looking forward to trying their fries fried in Peanut Oil, but unfortunately they were all out of sweet potato and regular fries... Hopefully next time.I still hope this truck stays in business for years to come cuz I will definitely be coming back!
5	I started following these guys on Twitter, not knowing that I was on the heels of a traveling burger circus goldmine. Finally, a coworker started talking about Slider Truck. He had hunted them down and immediately started speaking madly, as if he'd fallen in love.A few days later around six of us tracked Slider Truck down to their location of the morning. I got two Barbies and sweet potato fries.I was stuffed.Some people bought three different sliders and fries! Were they crazy? Yes. And in food heaven as a result.Go forth and find the slider truck. You'll be glad you did.
5	Really glad there is not a limit to the number of times I can update my review :) Even though I keep saying the same thing over and over and over again.Caught up with the guys again last night in back of Yogurtland. 2 Barbies, 1 Plain Jane and an order of sweet potato fries later... I was in Slider Heaven. Took an order to go for my girlfriend who I was picking up at the airport and she liked as well.So sad that I will only get one more trip to the Slider Truck before I move.
5	Last night I popped my Slider Truck cherry. My first attempt to get some action from the Slider Truck was an epic fail. I got a twitter update from them saying they were out of food when I was 5 minutes away. When I pulled up to the motorcycle event @ the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and saw the truck still there, I felt like Harold and Kumar when they finally made it to White Castle. I had the Captain's Order, Barbie, and some Sweet Potato Fries. As I sat down on the curb to eat my sliders, the band sings, "Stop, hey, what's that sound. Everybody look what's going down." The weather was perfect. I unroll my napkins and find some wet-naps and a Laffy Taffy!! The sliders were the bomb diggity!!The Slider Truck Crew were all cool cats. I will come back to attack the rest of the menu. Fo sho!!!I made this journey alone so I left right after I finished my food. I wish I had stayed because I found out there was motorcycle stunts after I left.
5	After hearing everyone rave about slider truck, I decided to give it a try. I had this afternoon off and they were setting up lunch a few blocks from my house, so today was the day.Most places that are really hyped up never seem to wow me, I don't know if I go in expecting too much or if I'm just don't seem to like what others do, but I will tell you this Slider Truck lived up to the Hype.I met a friend there for lunch, when I pulled up there were about 5 people infront of us in line, but it moved pretty quickly, I ordered 2 Barbies and a Pulled Porkie, along with a gatorade. I thought about the sweet potato fries but passed (will get them next time).The wait for the line and the wait for the food weren't bad, my only real complaint was the location, there was a half wall to sit on, but no tables or anything, and well being 100+ degrees a place to sit would have been nice, but you can't really blame them for that.The Barbie were great...I got them with out the Jalapenos, as I'm not a pepper fan, but the rest was amazing, the buns were soft and toasted to perfection, the beef was great, you can tell they were hand pattied not premade, and the BBQ sauce is amazing!!!As if the Barbie wasn't good enough...the Pulled Porkie was AMAZING...the pork was moist, and had a good smoky flavor, the buns the same as the barbie, and the sauce was amazing as well, next time I'll probably just get Porkies unless they have something new to try as it was my hands down favorite.I really like when a place lives up to the hype and without a doubt this won't be the last time I visit the Slider Truck.Today I lost my Slidginity and it was amazing!!!
4	I went to the Slider Truck by Cox Communication near Rancho today.  I had the Pulled Porkie and it was excellent.  They sold out of sweet potato fries, so I had to settle for regular, which are excellent.I'd like to give real stars in the heads of some people who came with orders for large numbers of sliders.  It made the wait quite long, and being about 100 degrees outside, it was a tad uncomfortable with just one small tree with shade.  I will find this truck again and go earlier.  Perhaps I'll find it far away from another office building.  The good thing about this was that I initially heard of where the truck would be from a Nevada State Museum Facebook post.  I had my sandwich and did as they suggested.  I went to museum after lunch.
4	Believe the hype! As chance would have it we checked Yelp and ST's website today and they're on our side of town for a change, woo hoo! Super friendly service and didn't take long at all, glad we got there early :)We got a combo with 5 sliders, an order of sweet tater fries and a Coke in a bottle, yup a glass bottle!In no particular order we tried the Yaya which was kind of like a gyro/Greek thing going for it, quite good! The Pep Pep which was good but ranks on the bottom of our 5 and simply due to being more of a traditional burger. The eggplant which was good but not my favorite. I'd definitely say the Porkie and Barbie were my 2 favorites. The sweet potato fries were really good too and big enough to share. In order for me would probably be:1. Barbie2. Porkie3. Yaya4. Eggplant Caprese5. Pep PepWe highly recommend you check out Slider Truck when they're in your neighborhood!
4	I totally forgot to Yelp these cool cats! I guess because it's not an actual food location, I just forgot.What can I say that hasn't already been said? The Slider Truck is pretty bomb. I've only been able to visit them once, but I'm a fan. I had three sliders and some sweet potato fries. For the sliders, I chose a Pep Pep, a Yaya, and a Captain's order. I don't know which is my favorite because they were all equally good. And of course, the sweet potato fries were off the hook.
5	So I finally got to hit up Slider Truck last week for the first time when they were closer to home, stopping outside Cox Communications. I am in LOVE! These gourmet sliders are perfectly sized and seasoned, toppings are total nom! Today was a repeat of Captains Order (because I LOVE the balsamic reduction) and the YaYa (because I'm a fetaholic and the white wine vinaigrette is the bomb), but also ordered the PepPep and Pulled Porkie for my mom, she loved the flavor combos, and the caramalized jalepenos were scrumptious! My son had a plain jane, my husband had a Eggplant Caprese, PepPep and a YaYa. Sweet potato fries are yummy with a light salting to compliment the cinnamon dusting. Today i ventured to the far west side to satisfy my craving for balsamic reduction, and to beg them to come to the north east side! Get some window love!!
5	I have to say, when I first thought of food from a truck I imagined tasteless burritos or subpar sandwich fare. My first encounter with Slider Truck was outside Retro Bakery during the Johnny Cupcakes tour. While I waited in line for four hours, hot and famished, I ignored Slider Truck on shear principle. Really? Those people must be desperate to be eating food from a truck that just rolls on up and throws food out a window. Don't they see the 7-11 right here? At least with a 7-11 hot dog your expectations are so low it's hard for them not to be met... but I digress. Slider Truck, at first glance, I thought you were a poor excuse for wetting my taste buds. And now I'm here to publically admit how very, very wrong I was. I can now proudly say I am not only a Slider Truck stalker, but an addict. Drug of choice? Pulled Porkie slider with a sweet potato after shock. I'm actually not a big fan of burgers in general, so I leave the rest of the sliders to my husband to explore (he's tried them all and he, too, is now an addict).  But the Porkies?  Holy shit. I can't remember a time I tasted pork so flavorful that just a light drizzle of BBQ sauce is all that's necessary to make them sing praises in my mouth. (They normally come with some caramelized jalapeno- but I like to keep it simple.) The buns are light, but toasted to perfection and each mouthful is truly scrumptious. And as if that weren't enough to make your stomach growl for an encore--there's the sweet potato fries. To date, the best sweet potato fries I have EVER tasted. Crisp, light, sweet with a dusting of cinnamon and sugar (although, I know Ric--the slider truck guy--is more than happy to dust with salt if you so prefer).  You know you have a good thing when I'd rather find the Slider Truck for date night than hit up some restaurant...and the fries--great to stuff in your purse for the movie-shhh! And if it matters, my 8.5 month old also thoroughly enjoys both the Porkies and fries. He had his first taste last night and screamed for more long after I'd polished off the last bite. The insanely delectable sliders can only be made better by the uber-friendly owner, Ric, who clearly pours his heart and soul into his business. Nice guy, great food, excellent business concept- what's there not to love?Would I recommend you stalking the Slider Truck? Absolutely. Is it worth all the hype? Absolutely. Am I already craving more sliders? You betcha!
5	Was walking around First Friday with the Yelp-izzles and I spotted the sweet eye candy on the Slider Truck. I wasn't hungry yet, but I could not get this close and pass it up.Said wuddup to my boy Ric and ordered a Pep Pep and a Pulled Porkie. It came with a wet-nap and a 2pk of Starburst. They were both hella yummy in my tummy!!
4	I love their food, and the guys that run the truck are so cool! I only rated it four stars instead of 5 because the wait can be so long sometimes (especially in the hot sun).
5	Food that creates a smile is great food, but food that inspires--that's fantastic food.  The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.With the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  With the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.These sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.Line up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.  They are everything that I need when I want my burger fix.Thanks for the inspiration, slider truck.
5	The slider truck = too good to be true. I had an amazing experience trying them out at First Friday, Ric was so nice & friendly. My Eggplant Caprese was off-the-chain-delicious. I cannot wait to catch them again!
5	I've been dying to try the truck for a while, so when it was at Cox Communications right by my office (6/25), I knew a good opportunity when I saw it.  I waited almost two hours in the blazing hot sun!!!  My lunch break quickly became an extended vacation, and my entire office was waiting for me to bring back lunch for everyone and you know what?  IT WAS WORTH EVERY MINUTE.  So yummy.What I had in order of how much I loved:Pulled Porkie - Wow!  My favorite even though the Barbie was a close second.Barbie - So good.  Has a spicy kick.Yaya - Tasty if you like feta which I freaking do!By the time I ordered, they were out of sweet potatoe fries, so I had the regular.  Fries were great, but now I have to go back and try the sweet potato fries.  Hopefully, the truck will swing this way soon because I have been seriously dreaming of these yummy sliders.
5	This place is FANTASTIC!  Burgers are delicious and innovative.  I've had every burger on the menu several times and have yet to be disappointed.  Love the pulled pork slider and the Pep Pep.  I haven't seen the kalbi slider in a while and look forward to trying one again.Bonus is they have Mexican Coke!  The stuff with real sugar instead of that corn syrup crap in American Coke.
5	I made it to Slider Truck on monday at their "secret location"...Monday was my day off, I didn't really want to leave the house, but when I saw they were doing the French Dippers...I knew I had to be part of the night.I got to the "secret" location, it was a well shaded place (good call guys...first time was majorly lacking shade), and I was about 15th in line, it took a while, but everyone was patient and anxiously awaiting their chance at the french dippers.I ordered 3 french dippers, 2 porkies, and 1 barbie, I have to say the Barbie was solid, the french dippers were great (probably a little over hyped but still really good), and the porkies were AMAZING as usual.I'm pretty sure I would shove my mother into oncoming traffic if it meant I would get my hands on another porkie or two!Also make sure you tell them that Yelp has sent you, you will get a slider on the house, just make sure to review...and if you get a porkie I'm pretty sure you'll give it 5 stars
5	I finally caught this truck close to my work and I went for it! It was all that I imagined it would be. I had the Yaya, the Barbie and the Caprese. All were delicious and flavorful! I think my favorite is the Barbie, but I would order any of them again! I've got my radar on now...totally gonna stalk this truck!
4	Went today after waiting to try these guys for awhile. It seems like they're rarely on my side of town, so I used my day off to hunt them down to the far end of town. We met up with some family and got in line right away. My boyfriend and I both got the extra yelp slider, that was pretty cool, so thanks guys! I got the Captain's Order [my fave of the beef, had great flavor and texture combos], Yaya [my boyfriend's fave], Pep Pep, and the Porkie [my second favorite]. The pork was tender and flavorful, with great jalapeno and cheese condiments.The Yaya was good, I liked the sauce and anything that has feta cheese gets my vote. The service was really friendly and enthusiastic. At one point I could over hear the kitchen talk and everyone was being checked in with and offered waters, so it seemed like there was a good team ethic. They even had a dog treat for my puppy, which was sweet. The food was great, better than any fast food.I wish they'd hit up more east side spots, maybe more university area ones would be nice, too, but I understand their constraints. It's a fun concept and I'm glad it's finally catching on in Vegas, I hope more of their kind start coming into fruition! They had coca cola in the glass bottles, which was cool. I didn't really dig the sweet potato fries- everyone we were with recommended them very highly, but I found them too sugary. I think a chile lime or saltier topping would've been more aligned with my palate. If I go again, I'll try their other fries to be fair. The caprese also sounded really good, so that's also on the horizon. If they're in your area, give them a try! The lines can be long, but they're doing a great job in such a small workspace. Way to go guys!
3	The Skinny: good, interesting, innovative slider flavours with some problems with execution (2.75), service - very friendly but difficulties with timing (3), value - not that great - have had better sliders for less and in a more comfortable environment. (2.5)This review is based on two visits to the slider truck.After a disappointing first visit (we waited 45 minutes but ended up with no food  due to a dysfunctional propane tank), we ventured for a second try after getting our previous order comped. We were greeted by an enthusiastic Ric and we received our order about 20 minutes later despite being the 5th order of the day. Hawaiian rolls were the specials of the day. We tried several sliders and only two hit home. Captain's Order and the Barbie were quite good - nice flavours, nicely prepared. Pep Pep was slightly overseasoned with the toppings of carmelized onions and salty bacon. The Eggplant Caprese was underseasoned. The Yaya was their take on gyros however the sauce made the burgers too soggy. The pulled pork and buns were burnt albeit the jalapeno glaze was quite tasty.The sweet potato fries were a delightful cinnamon, salty, sugary concoction that works.Overall, I don't think I have a burning desire to go back to the slider truck. The food is interesting but the inconsistency in quality does not warrant the price or the long wait in 105 F weather.
4	I heard a plethora of rave reviews before venturing to the NW part of town from the SW to try the Slider Truck.  I had heard there were sometimes long lines but that it was worth the wait.  Unfortunately, my first experience was beyond a "long" line.  We waited a little over an hour only to discover that they ran out of food when it came time to make our order. :-(  At this point I was beyond starving but Ric refunded our money, gave us some free drinks, and comped our next meal.  I was at work one Saturday when I saw via Twitter that the Slider Truck was on Sahara and Maryland which was right on my way home from work.  I still had the comp so I swung in to find the truck.  There was virtually no line and my food was up in no time at all.  The food was amazing.  I had the Caprese and my bf had the Barbie, Plain Jane, and Pep Pep.  We both had the sweet potato fries which might actually be my favorite part of the whole thing.  Did the food redeem our initial experience?  Yes.  We just caught the truck again last night and the food was even better this time.  There was a line when we arrived but it went quickly.  Just be prepared to wait a bit.  Bring a camp chair if you have to!  And it's not exactly cheap.  But it's amazing food and worth the wait and the price.  Ric is also a super nice guy and always takes care of his customers.   I'd actually like to give the Slider Truck 4.5 stars, but that's not an option.
5	So after hearing and reading so much about the slider truck we decided to give it a try. My first Slider Truck experience was a secret location on N. Lake Dr. We were fortunate enough to get just on time with the truck when the line wasn't long. Seeing as I am so indecisive about everything I figured it was just a good idea to order one of everything. It was a good idea. The result was little container full of different flavored sliders which had me salivating. They were so good I was tempted to lick the Styrofoam container that had some jalapeno jelly on it. Luckily there was still a little bun left to sop up all that juicy goodness. Now a few words on service. I love friendly service and these people make you feel right at home. From greeting to pickup the smiles don't stop. How does it feel to love your job? The way these guys look at work it seems they have the answer to that question. My second Slider Truck experience was the very next day in the back parking lot on Flamingo. Got there in the evening an hour before they closed up and got a couple of Pep Peps, YaYas, Barbies and Captain's Orders. Great eats again.  And you get free candy!It was an awesome and fun experience both times. I can't wait for my next experience.
5	Slider Truck was really excellent.  The sweet potato fries are pretty interesting, I think they add sugar to them which provides a really unique taste.  We tried every type of slider, and all of them had a really nice and unexpected balance of flavor that worked well.  We went twice, one day they had hawaiian roll buns and the other day they had normal buns.  The hawaiian rolls actually ended up tasting better than their standard bun.  One word of advice, both days they sold out of certain types of sliders, so get there early if you want to try a particular one!  Also, the owner of the place is incredibly nice and personable, be sure to give him some window love!
4	I decided to check them out based on a piece on the news, plus I got a coupon via  text from the web site.  I think it was for 1 free slider.  So I showed up, ordered 3 captain's orders.  First off, I think for 3 little burgers it was(I think) around 6 dollars.  I paid for 2, with one free.  Even that I thought was overpriced.  The burger itself was pretty good, better tasting than your average fast food burger, but for the price, too much.  I'd rather get a Double double meal for the same price(burger fries and drink) for the price of my discounted sliders.  Of course generally you have to drive to wherever the truck is if you feel like getting the food, which is also a bit of a pain.  Lastly, I paid for 2 sliders and I got back change as if I bought 3....generally I trust vendors, plus it was hot and i wanted to get in my car, eat, and go...really didn't feel like driving back for the correct change.Update 12/7/2010 :They have definitely made things much better in today's economic climate.  The addition of random dollar slider happy hours, in this reviewer's opinion, has made the usually long trip to their truck, much easier to swallow.  Just need to keep watch for texts from them that you sign up for to get these specials! Bravo :)
4	Slidin' Thru owner Ric describes his 'Slider Truck' as 'Vegas' first and only premier mobile restaurant, serving gourmet sliders made from the freshest ingredients.' Using social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook he is able to let his customers know where he'll be parking for lunch that day, or if there has been a last minute change to the schedule because he's been booted from his post. His truck has already become the talk of the town and he's only been open since Spring, so plan on a line when you come. His colorful comic strip ride is fun to look at while you wait, but if you try to stay out of the sun when its 100 degrees out, I'd suggest coming after summer. At one point my husband and I had been semi serious about starting our own food truck, but the realization we would be in a confined space with limited AC and a flat top in the middle of summer stopped us dead in our tracks. I give Ric and his crew major points for facing this challenge, so I suppose the least we can do is wait a few minutes for a few of his tasty creations.  The day I faced the heat I tried the Pep Pep, the Yaya, and the Pulled Porkie, of which the latter was my favorite. The pork was tender and not shredded to death, and the tangy, spicy barbecue sauce bathed it well. The caramelized jalapeno was a nice touch. The Pep Pep was good but ordinary, something like an In-n-Out Burger with a special sauce moving more in the direction of tartar than Russian. Ric also adds crispy bacon to his. The Yaya, a Greek inspired slider with feta, red onion, tomato, and taziki felt healthier than it was on account of the sharpness from the white wine vinaigrette dressing the lettuce. The flavors are great but perhaps lamb for the meat instead of angus would have been better. I can understand the constraints on using more expensive proteins, however, because his sliders are very affordable. You can get one for $3, two for $5, or three for $7. I would be willing to try any of his other sliders, but next time will pass on the limp sweet potato fries, $3. They're tossed with cinnamon and sugar, which I believe would make for a better seasoning if the sugar were replaced with salt. The sweet potatoes offer all the sugar you need, and if that's still not enough then you can munch on the whimsical fun pack of skittles Ric puts alongside your sliders.It seems the young people starting unique food businesses in Vegas are favoring burgers. I'd much rather have these businesses than not, but it would be great if someone could come out with something a little different. Hopefully this is just the beginning of the food truck trend in Vegas and the next mobile chefs will explore other possibilities for fun, fast food. I have no doubt that Slidin' Thru will be able to hold onto the burger market for years to come, but there is still plenty of room for mobile catering growth. I look forward to seeing what kind of food truck comes next!
5	Life has improved in Vegas and the change came in on four wheels.  Finally.  Finally, the food truck culture of Los Angeles is invading the Vegas Valley.  And Slidin' Thru is the best of the slider trucks.  The burger meat was decent, but the toppings made the sandwich.  One consisting of balsamic vinegar, feta cheese and spinach; one with classic cheddar and caramelized jalapeno.  And I don't have even the slightest criticism of the pulled pork slider--delicious.  Three thumbs up out of two.
5	In the words of Justin M. "God bless Ric and his big truck of tiny burgers."If you want to have some of the tastiest sliders that you'll ever eat in your life, seek out the Slider Truck. If that means that you have to drive across town, DO IT. It's worth every dollar of gasoline, even in this heat. Their schedule is posted weekly on their website and I suggest you get there early if you want to eat. My favorite is the Pulled Porkie. Hands down, the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. I also usually get the Barbie. Can't remember exactly what's on it, but dang it's yummy. Everyone likes their sweet potato fries and they are good, but I like their regular fries the best, with salt and pepper. So do your stomach a favor and visit the Slider Truck....EVERY DAY.
4	I took my husband to the Slider Truck on Saturday for his extended birthday dining extravaganza (read: 3 days worth of eating out at new places ONLY for his gift). We were both Slider Truck virgins, in fact, he had never heard of the slider truck! We came early, per Yelper advice, and showed up at Sunset part at 11:30. No line, phew! He ordered FOUR sliders (we skipped breakfast on purpose :), and I ordered three. I got the Barbie, the Yaya and the Pulled Porkie. He got the Captain, Yaya, Pep Pep and the Porkie. My fave was the Barbie. His, the Porkie. We felt the prices were very reasonable for the amount of food we ate. All ingredients tasted very fresh, the flavor combinations were superb and the staff was very friendly. You can bet that my truck will be following the Slider Truck plenty more times.
5	Oh yeah, the Slider Truck is slidin' by my house tonight. These gourmet sliders are sooo good. The only bad thing is they may be slightly addictive. I don't know if I'll be able to wait another week for my slider fix. Oh well, I can always go to their website and find out where they are tomorrow.
5	Amazing sliders and great service. I try to go whenever its near me.
4	I had sliders from this glorious truck maybe two weeks ago and I am a fan! I ordered the Barbie and the Pep Pep. Both were very good and I recommend that everyone try it. The guy at the window was very friendly and had a lot of energy, which is probably good because that line gets really long. It was a good thing that I got there early because the line just got longer and longer.I recommend that people go on their site to find out exactly when and where the slider truck will be. Their site also has their menu with a description of each slider.The sliders are decently priced and decent sizes. I think an average eater can stomach about two and feel comfortably full. They serve their pop in old-school glass bottles. Love it. They also serve candy with your meal which is so cute.I love the Slider Truck and can't wait 'til I catch it again!
5	ALWAYS the most perfect, delicious, quality, innovative sliders. it's a wonderful community experience that everyone walks away giddy from.
5	Waited in the sun for about 40 minutes or so today, but it was well worth it. I wanted to update this because when I ordered today, Ric remembered the first time that I came, which was about 3 months ago. I don't recall anything that made it memorable for Ric, but to me it shows how much he cares about his customers if he can remember their first visit.
5	Many things come to mind when I think fast food. For example: pesticide and growth hormone ridden, mass produced factory filler food, watered down and everything but tasty.  Slidin Thru is everything but, and is living proof that fast food doesn't necessarily have to be bad food. Since it was my first time visiting the Sliding Thru truck I did what any newbie would do...order one of everything. Saying that they were just good would be demoralizing and not only be an understatement but a culinary injustice.  These sliders were outstanding.  I could sing the praises of every slider I had, however my favorite was the "YaYa" .  Now you may be asking yourself,"whats a YaYa"?  If a gyro and a hamburger had a baby, the "YaYa" would be the offspring, and a delicious offspring at that.  One beautifully tender, tasty, saucy edible baby....mmmmm baby.  This was also another first for me, it was the first time I've ever tried sweet potato fries.  Considering I don't like sweet potatoes, and when I say "I don't like sweet potatoes" it's just a nice way of me saying "F U, you weird mutant orange nuclear sorry excuse for a potato thing ...WTF".  With that being said I've never gone out of my way to give them a shot.  I'll be honest, I thought they were good, but I am a fan of a more traditional fry.  I felt the whole sweet and sugary thing was more of a desert than the salty, ketchup drenched french fries I grew up loving.   Now before you loyal Slidin Thru fans feel the need to mob up and march to my house waving torches and pitch forks, I can assure you I did truly like the sweet potato fries, just didn't love them.Now hopefully you will all stop stuffing your gaping face holes with Woppers, McNuggets and other BS fast food alike and go get yourself some window love.  Here's to you SidinThru, you road bound rouge burger assassins fighting the good fight against bogus fast food.  The entire Southern Nevada region owes you their thanks for proving to them that fast food can not only just be good, but real good.
4	I'd give the SliderTruck a 4 and 1/2.  They lose 1/2 a star for the wait (45 minutes in my case).  However, there is a bit of a disclaimer stating the sliders are cooked to order.Here goes.So I was actually planning on hitting up the Fukuburger truck tonight with a big order for my buddies at work... but that truck was 3 hours late.  I follow both on Twitter and remembered Slidin Thru was just up the road.  I get there and the line didn't seem too bad, but I guess there were a bunch of large orders (the ladies in front of me ordered TEN sliders for the two of them...my kind of girls)Its finally my turn to get some window love and I'm left standing there for a couple of minutes before my order is taken... but its ok.  There are 3 guys working the truck and they all have that dorky but cute thing going on.  They were out of regular fries and the lady in front of me snagged the last orange Fanta in a glass bottle :(I ordered 6 sliders (1 of everything on the menu; I figured, try the menu the first time so the next time I know which ones I REALLY liked) and an order of cinnamon sugar sweet potato fries. All to go.  The food came up quick, piping hot, and I knew everything was fresh because you could see them cooking it.Surprisingly, the sliders were still warm when I got home about half an hour later.  Unfortunately, I got in a bit of a fender bender trying to exit the parking lot (some db orthodontist in a giant denali didnt see me in my little sebring convertible and I guess he had some emergency or something... whole other story) Bottom Line:Expect to wait because the sliders are THAT good. The Barbie was good but not all it was hyped up to be. My favorites were the Eggplant Caprese and the Yaya (feta, tzatziki, white wine vinaigrette).  Sweet potato fries are a must (at least for me...)
5	Yummy sliders esp. the Pep Pep! Get the sweet potato fries! The most delish sweet potato fries I have EVER had!!!
5	If you went to go watch Martin Luther the King Jr. speak at an event, you'd be amazed at his speech skills right? How would you follow that up with something even more amazing? You can't.That's how I felt when I last reviewed the Slider Truck. Except this time, the slider truck DID out-do itself. And it was awesome. I popped in after my kickball game last night (we won 20-6...dont mess with pink) and saw a line. I remembered last time that the line moved a bit slow, but it was a hot day, the truck was still within its first couple months or so of existence and I was uber hungry.This time, the line went by fast. I mean super fast. The efficiency of the Slider Truck brought a giant smile to my belly.I ordered two pulled porkies and a yaya. All were fantastic. The Yaya was VERY good. Try it.One very important note to share: I used my groupon. Instead of wincing at the thought of "another cheap customer", Ric was so gracious and was happy that I took part in this Groupon promotion. He could've easily given me attitude like many businesses do when you use a coupon/groupon or the like.The level of service, friendly attitude and genuine kindness from all Slider Truck employees made me very happy.As I move to Phoenix in a couple weeks, I really hope that my new city has food trucks. BUT, I have no problem coming back to Vegas to visit.
5	Tonight was my tenth time going to the slider truck. I waited till now to review them as I wanted to make sure it was not a fluke and was really as good as the first time. It is and keeps getting better...I got there a little after 6 and there was already a good line 10 deep plus a few tailgaters. This location by Retro Bakery is always packed. I waited for about 20 minutes and placed my usual order. After a ten minute wait for my Porkies and Barbie I turned to eat in my car and realized that the line grew to 30+ strong easily. I was tempted to count them but the smell of my meal to be was overwhelming so I ate instead. I heard that they ran out of food and that does not surprise me. The burgers are that good and word is out so do not delay. Get there early.  They ran out of stock because it is so damn good and obviously the truck can only hold so much food. I for one would rather go to a place that runs out of food than one that always has a well stocked shelf...
5	Managed to catch it at First Friday where I went just so I could try these mouthwatering morsels of meat, cheese and bread.  I even brought my friend from Nova Scotia to try them.  Between 3 of us we got 6 Pep Peps and an order of fries.  We were all so stuffed!! To look at the burgers you think you can eat a dozen but 2 were filling enough that we had to walk around for some digestive help.  The meat was juicy and delicious, the bacon crisp, and they put some weird sauce on it that I couldn't identify, when I licked it off my fingers it tasted very strange but when mixed with the meats, cheese, tomato, grilled onion and pickles was totally awesome.  The only thing bad is that it does take a while to get your food and there is no place to sit to eat but good food is worth the wait. I am going to have to program their routes in my GPS so I can have access anytime as I crave these tiny but filling burgers all the time now!!!
3	The last time I saw 3 guys in a bus handing things to a huge crowd I woke up a week later on the Phish tour bus with a girl name Love Moonbeam...or Moon Lovebeam...or Beam Moonlove. Maybe it was Nancy.  Whatever.  It was told I had a good time. I was told I was a God.  I was told to get off the bus immediately. Damn hippies are so sensitive.  Make one Grace Slick heroin joke and suddenly you are Pol Pot. Never trust a hippie. Always wash any midget you come in contact with. Two things that will serve you well dear readers.Well, what does this brief moment with the unwashed have to do with anything? I don't know. I just swallowed two green pills I found in an alley way I woke up in last night. (Another long story, but it begins as all long stories do...with a fist full of cash and a woman of ill-repute.)  So, before I nod off or run 15 miles backwards again...I will continue with my words of love, food, and tiny microbes that live in our brains.So, everywhere Rex has hung his hat, his lovely purple feathered hat, one constant thing I hear is "how the hell did you find us?"  After that is how good the Slider Truck is.  Slider Truck. Screams as they run. Faint murmurs of Slider Truck. Silence. Time and time again. The same pattern.  I know why they scream, I didn't understand the Slider Truck obsession.  Well, Rex is no stranger to herpes and taking food from strangers in a vehicle.  Usually with those two things I see a cause and effect.  Thankfully this time I didn't have to do anything untoward, just pay money and the food came.So me and my favorite part time wench went to a park in Henderson to try this local phenomenon.  I got into line. The line barely moved. I waited. The line barely moved. I waited 30 minutes and I was not much closer. Rex became angry. Rex became incensed. Rex cried out to the skies. Rex cried.  After an hour, two beatings, and a slight case of heat stroke I arrived at the window. I had gone to their website and studied their menu. I knew what I wanted. I ordered like a pro. The kid who took my order smiled brightly and called me his hero. I blushed. Me and my sometimes intimate partner I only have to pay scale moved over to wait some more.  We ordered 1 Barbie, 2 Pep Pep and 3 Pulled Porkies. We added drinks and the sweet potato fries.  We waited some more. It took time. Rex hates waiting and this has tried my patience and my left hook to the point of exhaustion.  Finally the food came. We celebrated. We danced. She cried out of her non-glass eye.  It was a beautiful day, only about 200 degrees outside. We sat under a tree. The food smelled great.  I ate the Barbie and the BBQ sauce was great and the caramelized jalapeno balanced the sweetness.  The Pep Pep was like an attempt at a gourmet Big Mac. The sauce was very familiar and very tasty. Tangy and sweet. It was good. Then the pulled pork. Tender pork, bbq sauce and a little heat from the jalapeno. I ate one of the sweet potato fries and then put about 75% of the container in my mouth at one time.  The verdict...decidedly mixed.  I admire these kids and their attempts to recreate the food trucks of other cities...but it needs to be more than just clever and right now this is just clever. The star of the show was the pulled pork, and why...it was the  only thing that wasn't overcooked. It wasn't sauced enough and it needed a little more flavor in the pork when it was cooking, but overall it was very good. The bun has a bit of grease on it and that made it very buttery. That was nice.  The burgers had the potential to be amazing, but they just weren't. They were so far overcooked that the Barbie I had was like a hockey puck. The Pep Pep was very good but again over cooked and under sauced. I loved the fries. They were well done and relatively inventive. Salt, sugar and spice. Excellent. Another surprise flavor could have really stepped it up a notch, but I am not going to nitpick. I want to like these guys, I want to support them. But when I spend almost 30 bucks on dinner I better get more than some really over cooked meat.  The portions were "slider" size but the prices were gourmet (3 for 7 bucks), and the execution was decidedly NOT gourmet. I think the worse thing I can say is that given the wait, the overcooked meat and the lack of some basic fundamentals with the food I can't say I would come back. If I didn't have to wait an hour I would eat there again, but right now the town is obsessed with novelty food that lacks sophistication...why should I spoil that for them.  To me this is like dating a supermodel without a vagina...slightly depressing, terribly irritating and not worth the time you put into it. You want to love her, but you can't.You can love Rex. Try as hard as you can. Rex can't love you.
5	Just visited again on Thursday 8/12/10.  This time, I got to the truck around 11:30 and very minimal wait.  Plus I had a groupon!  Aside from the fact that these little burgers are soo delicious, the guys are always welcoming and friendly.  Best customer service in town hands down.  I love you slider truck!
1	I really hate to do this, but today was a serious wtf on behalf of the Slider Truck.Got to the Lakes location at 5:55, they were supposed to be there at 6 PM. There was already quite a line, but it didn't look like more than 30 minute wait. We didn't wait 30 minutes. We waited 45 minutes and only moved 15 feet with about 20 people ahead of us still. Matt and I did not get food tonight. You know why we didn't get food? We overheard that some lady up front ordered TWO DOZEN sliders. When you are a business that makes items as they're ordered and you see a crazy-long line, you have to draw the line somewhere. Seriously, it should be 6 sliders per customer, period. TWO DOZEN. Who the hell needs 24 sliders?? You should not be ordering for friends or family, you need to drag their butts down there so you can stare at all the people glaring at you for holding them up from eating. I don't think we would have been served in an hour and a half, and there's no way that the Slider Truck is worth that kind of wait. Half hour tops. And that is usually all I have to wait if not less. But once it gets past an hour, it gets ridiculous. I'm seriously thinking about selling my Groupon that I have for them because the wait times have gone up like crazy and I don't think I'll be able to use it anytime soon. Oh and P.S. Anyone who cuts the line at the Slider Truck, you have a separate circle in hell waiting for you.
4	The Slider Truck has garnered some immediate successes upon their opening early this summer, and well worth it.  You can't help but notice their truck as they go sliding on through!  It's completely painted brightly with cartoon-like images.My first experience with them was after the Las Vegas AIDS Walk where we had the Slider Truck pretty much to ourselves.  There was no wait really to put in our order, so that was definitely something we appreciated.  At the time, they were still experimenting with different burgers, so we only had a few to choose from.One thing we did like from the start was the Pep Pep, which has sauteed onions, crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, melted cheese on top of a juicy patty along with their super sauce.They also had the Pulled Porkie during that time, which has layers of pork on top of the toasted buns.  We also tried the Barbie had cheese and bacon over the burger, along with plenty of barbecue sauce.For the price you pay, there is definitely a lot of meat in between those two buns and it's a moist burger too.  We've paid more for a lot less - quantity and taste-wise, so this was a welcome addition to Vegas.Our next experience was on a Friday night and long lines were known to be found where the Slider Truck was.  In this case, there was indeed a line, but it was really the people gathering and waiting for their burgers.  It was a good 45 minutes before we got our burgers.  Ric came out from the truck to apologize for the long wait and some kid piped up, "It's worth the wait!"  That pretty much sums it up!Overall, we love the Slider Truck and the idea behind it.  Sure, waiting 45 minutes for a burger brings the wait for truck food to a whole new level.  We'll keep our eyes out for this truck, but we'll have to watch our clock too at the same time.  We definitely want to see Ric and his crew do well.  Owners who care about their customers and are genuinely excited about what they are doing is something we should all support!
2	I thought the prices were a bit steep. I drove a nice distance just so i could try the pork and after waitng in line for a good 20 min i was tols they had no pork that day. This wasn't mentioned on FB nor did they tweet this ahead of time. It was an average slider experience to me. I am thankful of their popularity and can't wait for more food truck to hit the scene like in LA.
5	Experienced it for the first time today, both at the Summerlin Center location and behind Yogurtland. My coworkers and I beat the rush in the morning and everyone loved what they got. I had the Yaya and the Porkie for lunch, which is good because they were out of those by dinner. Both were absolutely excellent. For dinner I had the Barbie and Pep Pep. Barbie was probably the weakest of the four, though still quite good. Pep had great sauce. Both varieties of fries were good too!I wasn't sure what to expect from prices until I got there, and was pleasantly surprised. For $7 I can get two sliders and fries, which is the perfect amount of food (maybe even too many fries, so it's good for sharing). Can't complain about that!Hopefully these guys have some plans to move toward accepting credit cards, because I saw a few people bail from the evening line when they found out it was cash only. Maybe I missed it but it wasn't clearly posted on the signage, which might help, or on the website. But that's truly the only criticism I have. Looking forward to the next time they're nearby!
5	My wife heard about this truck from a friend and insisted that we stop in when it made it out to our neck of the woods in Henderson. Boy am I glad we did! Absolutely bomb. We got two Barbies, a Porkie, and the Eggplant Caprese. We also split an order of sweet potato fries.First, we got lots of fist pounding love at the window. Always a great way to start a food adventure. Follow that with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle, and a fresh order of sliders, and we were good.The sweet potato fries were hot, crispy, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. The Barbies were a letter-perfect combination of smoky, crunchy sweet onion and bacon, with a perfect patty and cheese. The pulled pork was succulent and juicy, with good seasoning. We were full, but I almost got back in the line to get more Barbies...It was that good.
5	Window Love is truly an experience everyone in Vegas should have at least once in their lives(or per week, whichever you choose). Fellow yelper Seth Y. and I were talking about how we could never find this place and the one time we decided to check the website it turns out they were less than 10 minutes away on S. Fort Apache.Once we got there the line was filled with a younger crowd camped out for burger goodness and although the wait was a bit long I could not have been happier to wait. The guys in the truck make sure the crowd is kept entertained and after you are done ordering the food truly speaks for itself.I won't bore anyone with talk of the food itself because I'm pretty sure a 5 star rating screams credibility about the food. All I will say is try a variety of sliders and make sure to get the fries you won't be disappointed one bit. I hope they keep on slidin thru for years to come.
2	I really admire what these guys are doing especially in the high desert of Las Vegas.  It is another facet that adds to the the sin cities list as not only a gamblers paradise but a food mecca as well with omg some developing culture.  Well at least a little, we probably need a few more generations and some starving artists needs to be the next Picasso.Trying to find these guys was fine.  Standing in line was not a problem I've waited longer on hold with banks and airlines.  We had the barbie, pep, pulled pork and captain's burgers / sliders.  Sounds like a lot but you gotta try everything if your going to wait in a line.  The smell, taste and style was almost reminiscent of the food that you see at carnivals or town fairs.  I love the burgers cooked on the outdoor grill at the farmer's market in SF.  The Slider Truck cooked everything decently and the flavors worked well.  Jut not overly impressed with the food.  Simple, done right but nothing innovative.  Didn't care for the pork which normally I love pig over beef.  A little tired of bbq sauce on burgers, there are a billions different styles and recipes, but at the end of the day they all have the same flavor elements which would taste good on anything chicken, steak, fries etc.  Doesn't make it great.
5	I thought Window Love would involve a lot more penetration; the only thing I got was a fist bump. What the fuck, slider truck?I kid, I kid. There's so much to say about this fantastic meal on wheels... it's an easy 10 on the food boner scale. Delicious meaty cheesy carmelized onion laden sliders. Pulled pork that merits pulling your pork.I don't see any reason not to give the truck 5 stars. The food was phenomenal, they've got a unique thing going on, and the girls that were ordering from the slider truck were perfect eye candy. I mean, some seriously hot chicks were getting some seriously delicious food. Slider Truck, more like Slider 'n Fuck, M I RITE GUYS?But seriously, these sliders will cure your erectile dysfunction.
5	This truck is the greatest. Gourmet sliders ( beef, pork, veggie ), fresh cut fries and sweet potato fries and tall glass bottles of Coke.  They move around town but post their schedule on the website.  I always get them on Wednesday in Henderson. I am trying to get them to add a stop at Henderson Chevy in the Automall.  Chevy has given the thumbs up for Slidin Thru to park there any time they want.
5	So, my hubster, our daughter and I roll up to the parking lot behind the Yogurtland the other night to see what these guys are all about.....  There was a long line, so we figured it was worth the wait.  We were surrounded by a few regulars.... 40 Minute wait, but totally worth it!!!  We got the Barbie, Pep Pep,  Captain's Order and the Plain Jane (for our daughter)... So juicy and delicious!!!  We also tried the Sweet Potato Fries and those were outstanding!!!!  They shook the truck after we gave them a tip... of course we got Window Love before  and after we got our order.... These guys are doing something right...  Voted for them 10 times on the Web and our cell phones!!! =)
4	Much love for the slider truck.  Had the Pep Pep, Capn, and Ya Ya.  And I like them in that order.  Fries were good too. May try to track them down tomorrow, if not, Friday in Summerlin definitely.
5	I signed up for yelp just so I could give a five star review for slider truck.  Last night in front of sunrise coffee I experienced the slider truck for the first time.  I am now a fan. The windows  of the truck look like comic book panels and they look like a moving comic book.  I came up to the window and was greeted with a fist bump.  I asked them to make the barbie with no cheese or bacon, and grilled eggplant instead of meat-- they were happy to make it, no problem. I also ordered sweet potato fries with extra cinnamon and sugar.  My food was so good! Next time, probably five sliders-- just the same but with lots of crispy onions!  Sweet potato fries too, extra love please.  I'm hungry. :]]]  See you guys again soon!
3	My husband waited in line for 1 1/2 hours for 3 sliders. He never waits that long for food, and he raved about this place. He is a burger connoisseur. Me, not so much. I get my occasional cravings, but nothing to his extent. The Pep Pep and the Pulled Porkie are my favorites. I've tried everything but the Captain's order. Everything is delicious. They also have Mexican Coke's! That is ALWAYS a plus for me. If you're not wanting to wait in line, get there 40 minutes early, and get in line. You won't have to wait long if you're in the front or close. Otherwise, don't go hungry.
5	I LOVE THESE SLIDERS!!!!!! They came to my work place a few months ago and I've been hooked ever since! I actually check on their site every Monday to see where they will be that week so that I can drive to them and get my slider fix!!!The staff is always energetic and friendly!! I've tried other sliders in Las Vegas, but hands down... they are the freshest (is that a word? :) LOL) in town!!!!! Keep up the good work guys!!!
5	I had Slider Truck on my to do list for several months. I am an amazing procrastinator and I put off several opportunities to track down the Slider Truck. That is until it came to Sunrise Coffee one evening earlier this month. I love Sunrise Coffee so for me it was the perfect opportunity to finally check out and cross the Slider Truck off my "to do list."As a comic Book geek, I loved the comic book  truck design.  At the time I went there was only about 12 or 15 people in line and it moved along fairly quickly considering everything was made to order. I ordered 2 Eggplant Caprese sliders and Sweet Potato fries and my friend ordered 3 sliders (2 Pep Pep and a Barbie). My veggie sliders were very good.  My friend really enjoyed his sliders a lot too. I would give the food a solid 4 stars. I am giving Slider Truck 5 stars for the cool design of the truck, the fact that they serve Mexican Coca-Cola and not  Pepsi products,  and the super rad personalities who work on the truck. It's an added bonus to order from a food truck and not worry about getting the swine flu or hepatitis. Clean is good as are veggie options.I was feeling pretty special for being greeted with a fist bump until Krystal C. mentioned she received a fist bump as well. I guess the Slider Truck is in the business of making everyone feel special. Very good food, veggie options and great people are all reasons I will be giving my business to the Slider Truck again. I'm a fan!
5	Q:  Is it possible for slider truck to get better? A:  Yes, add more crispy fried onions to my regular order. I cant ask for much more after a long day of work than to have my favorite food truck parked in front of my favorite coffee shop in town.  Thanks for dinner, guys!
4	I thought these sliders were excellent.  The creativity of the combinations was really great and I enjoyed each one.  When I say each one I mean it.  My friend and I ordered and shared all six of the choices (I don't count the Plain Jane).  They were all very delicious!  The guy taking orders was very friendly which is very important.  I thought that both kinds of fries were great and I love Sweet Potato Fries!  I read some of the other reviews before I wrote mine and I think some of you people need to get over yourselves.  Somebody giving a bad review because someone ordered two dozen sliders?  Really?  That's ridiculous.  I will agree with most of the other reviewers in concerns with the wait time.  It really didn't bother me but I think these guys should throw some more burgers down when they see a line.  I just think that the food really outweighed the negative of the wait time and people should think about this when reviewing. I will definitely find this place again!
5	I never thought I would have or want to chase food down in Las Vegas with all of the options we have. This however is not just another moving target. First off the guy's have great positive energy going on! When's the last time you went for burgers and everyone was laughing and treating the customers with the same fun and enthusiasm. My wife and I drove up into the designated meet zone (I felt like I might have been meeting someone else more dangerous) and a boy about 7 or 8 sees the truck and starts freaking out!  He was screaming DAD, DAD THEY'RE HERE! it was a LOL moment for sure. I have tried all of the sliders and they are all great. I love the sweet potato fries and the orange soda. BTW how much sugar is in that? I don't have any tips for the crew but one for the first lady in line last night. When there are 20 people in line behind you please don't try and recreate their menu. The guy was very nice and said he didn't have what you were trying to order. End of story no reason keep grinding on him trying to get what you want. Look they have burgers and fries pick one or two and go with it.
2	Well I just moved back to Vegas following a stint in food truck-crazed Los Angeles, so I was kinda excited to see the trucks catching on in LV. I finally got off my lazy butt and tracked down the Slider Truck this week - turns out they were right down the street from my house - sweet! My husband and I proceed to the meetup point about 6:20 (they opened at 6:00), and there is a short line, maybe 10 people. "No big deal," we thought, "We've waited in lines twice as long for Philly steaks from a truck, asian tacos from a truck, hot dogs from a truck, and even bbq from a truck back in LA." Little did we know the process going on inside the slider truck would be so RIDICULOUS! Honestly, I really don't know what they're doing in there, but it took 30 minutes just for us to ORDER and then almost 15 more minutes to receive the food. How long can it take to cook those tiny pieces of meat??? Yeah, I read the sign that says "please be patient, burgers are cooked to order," but Burger King doesn't cook my burger until I order it either, and I think they could have served that entire line in less than 10 mins.For the actual food: the burgers and fries are pretty good and filling, and I liked the interesting list of burgers. Actually, because the burgers were good, I'm really giving it 2.5 stars, but I had to round down. Sorry.Price: ok. I mean, the food is good, but you are eating it in a parking lot, so you would think their overhead would be lower.Service: I don't get why everyone raves about the service. I mean, yeah, the guy at the window gives you a fist pound before you order, but seriously. I would have taken no fist pound if it meant I got my dinner 5 or 10 (or 40!) minutes faster.Bottom line: If it's a good fast burger you want, Fatburger is faster. If it's interesting toppings you want, Bachi Burger or Grind or Burger Bar have a larger selection. If it's a cheap burger you want, In-n-Out is less than half the price. And all of these options will provide you with a table, chairs, and air conditioning while you enjoy your food!On the other hand, if you want the novelty of eating from a truck, go here once, but just know what you're getting into....
2	I was so looking forward to the experience until I got there.  We stood in line for 45 minutes while only about 15 people got food.  It seemed the workers were more interested in having fun than getting the food to the consumer.  By the time we got to the front they were out of the pork, I don't eat red meat, so I got the eggplant.  We ordered regular fries and they were out.  I much prefer Flow Rider Truck.  The people were friendly and helpful.
5	Again, I was looking out for my office and noticed the slider truck was at Costco, which is about 30 seconds away!  Everyone ordered sliders, including the P90x fanatic.  He was willing to break his diet to finally try the slider truck.I had: Pulled Porkie, Barbie and Caprese.  This was my first time trying the Caprese, and I have to say, I didn't love it, but maybe that's because eggplant can only be so good in comparison to delicious meat!  Believe the hype.  Ric and the guys rock!  Nothing makes your day better like a good fist bump.  If you haven't been to the slider truck yet, get on the bandwagon and go.  Just leave a Pulled Porkie for me!
5	I think I need HELP,Cuz I'm addicted to YELP!Although.....Now that I've tried,The sweet potato fries,I have finally arrivedYou have answered my criesFor sliders, OH MY!OH WHY! haven't I tried,The Slider TruckTILL NOW!  After I discovered the Slider Truck on here earlier this week, I knew I had to try it.  I was so determined that I dragged my Grandparents, that were in town visiting, down to First Friday, just so we could find the truck.  As luck would have it, we had the same amount of people in our group, as they had sliders.  So we tried one of each and a bag of sweet potato fries, which was a mistake... WHY ONLY ONE :-0?  They are the BEST I'VE EVER ATE, and they made for the perfect dessert!All I know, is I can't wait to go back and get a bag all to myself :~}!
2	NOT impressed by the least. Service sucks and food is far from being noteworthy, especially by today's specialty burger standards. I waited in line to order for 40+ min and then another 15+ min for the food. The line was nowhere long enough to warrant that kind of wait. Out of the 4 or 5 different sliders that we ordered, none of them screamed delicious! We also got super salty regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries we ordered. I was ready and willing to vote them on for The Great Food Truck Race, but quickly changed my mind. Ya the guy was friendly and all, but a fist pump won't satisfy my starving tummy. Coming from LA, where food trucks took over, this truck needs to step it up if it wants to be worthy of competition.
3	After hearing so much about Slidin' Thru, we were excited to try it. On one hot summer evening, it set up shop within a few miles of home, so this was our chance to check it out. Alas it was not to be. We waited about half an hour to place our order and another 20 minutes, all during 100 degree temps, but ended up without any food due to a malfunctioning propane tank. Ric graciously refunded our money and even comp'd our order for next time.Several days later we returned to try again. We were 5th in line and received our food about 25 minutes later.Our favorites were the Captain's Order and the Barbie. They were tasty and well prepared. However, the other sliders let us down. The bacon in the Pep Pep was far too salty. The Eggplant Caprese lacked flavor and was in dire need of some kind of seasoning or even just salt. The Yaya was their Greek slider, but the tzatziki sauce made everything soggy and unappetizing. As for the Pulled Porkie, some of the pork and buns were burnt to the point of being inedible. We did enjoy the sweet potato fries which were tossed with cinnamon sugar.Ric has promising ideas on his menu but has issues with consistency and execution of those ideas. At $7 for 3 small sliders, we don't think the value is there. We have had larger and/or better tasting sliders for less and in nicer environs. While the service is very friendly and enthusiastic, the food quality simply does not justify the long wait times to place and then receive your order. We really want to like this place and support local entrepreneurs, but right now there are too many issues to draw us back.
5	Had the barbie and the captains order...freakin amazing...literally too yummy for words. Ric hooked us up too, which was appreciated as broke college students...highly recommend!!!
4	Fantastic food truck experience!These guys are the real deal and serve some high quality sliders in record time.  We caught them during the lunch hour traffic and it was clear they love doing what they do.The slider (or mini hamburger) options are quite plentiful but we opted for two burger styles, the Barbie and Captain's Order.  Both were delicious with tender hamburger meat and delicious toppings of bacon, balsamic vinegar, or cheese.The third slider choice was the Porkie's or Pulled pork slider.  Absolutely the best pulled pork sandwich I've had.  This was worth the drive to find them alone.  We topped our orders with an order of sweet fries (piping hot and sprinkled with cinnamon (yum!)) as well as two 1 litter ice cold soda pops on the house!  Perfect meal and a perfect food truck experience.  Look for these guys off the strip and look out for their 2nd truck coming soon!I believe they accept cash only.
5	After eating here more times than I can count on my fingers and toes, I decided to finally write a review. Not being a huge fan of burgers, I was hesitant about the slider truck. Little did I know it would become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.Let's start with the different types of burgers.BarbieA BBQ burger  topped with onion crisps, bbq sauce, and jalapenos.This is probably my favorite. The slight spice from the jalapenos makes this amazing. The BBQ sauce pops because of it.Pulled PorkieA BBQ pulled pork slider with jalapenos in the sauce. Delicious pork. Same sauce as the Barbie. Again with the jalapenos. So good.Pep PepA classic burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, onion and a "special" sauce.Get this if your looking for a classic cheese burger, with an extra touch of flavor.YaYaKind of like a gyro. Burger that has a really tasty tzatziki sauce with lettuce onion and tomato.Captains A burger with bacon, arugula, tomato, feta cheese, onion and balsamic.This one is also delicious.Eggplant CapreseThis is the only vegetarian choice on the menu. Eggplant, tomato, mozzarella, balsamic, and basil. Very fresh tasting. The eggplant has been huge on multiple occasions.Burgers are 1 for $3, 2 for $5, or 3 for $7.Drinks - $2Fries - $2 - Sweet Potato or Regular (Standard fries)These burgers are not tiny. 3 are more than filling. You need to go to their website to get a schedule for the week. www.slidinthru.comThey only take CASH. No cards.All of the burgers are excellent. The staff is extremely friendly.Go here NOW!
5	I've been to slider truck three times now and each experience has been better than the last. I wanted to post this because of my last experience why is the reason slider truck is the stone cold nuts.I showed up at about 8 and waited in line for about 30 min until they ran out of burgers. At that point I wasn't too mad seeing that I love their porkies just as much as I love (legal)high school girls. After placing my order I gave them my debit card and at that moment completely forgot they only take cash. Luckily these guys are the shit and they gave me a free meal and I made sure to pay them double next week plus a nice tip. Where else could you have service like that? Only at the slider truck!P.S. Barbie plus porkie may not be on the menu but for an extra dollar it'll provide you a full stomach and a massive food boner. Oh yeaaaa
5	Yeah, I was a little skeptical about eating "gourmet" burgers out of a truck, but I cannot hate, they were delicious! My friend from work had been stalking the Slider Truck all week because they were going to be near our office.  Well, I had absolutely NO intention of going- until she came back singing their praises- and offered me one of her sweet potato fries.  After that, I had to go! They were crisp, yet soft in the middle, bursting with flavor and only intensified by the brown sugar on top. So much for the diet!I got some cash, then went to wait in line.  It was probably a 20 minute wait from ordering till I got my food, but it was worth it.  The guys were so much fun, and gave you a fist bump as you walked up. They were pumping Wu Tang, and rocked the bus and blew the horn when you gave them a tip. And the food...Reasonably priced, and delicious. I got the Barbie, which was my favorite (BBQ sauce,onion crisps, bacon, cheese), and the Captain's Order (balsamic vingerette, feta cheese, bacon), which was a close second. 2 sliders for $5.  The sweet potato fries, of course.($3) I couldn't stop eating them, and was tempted to put the bag to my mouth and eat the sugar, too.  I sat in my car  and scarfed everything down in shame.  Eight dollars well spent!
3	Finally, finally made it to Slider Truck after the mishap back in April.  The ONLY reason why is that they came to UNLV for the UNLV Beverage Club.  Otherwise, they never seem to go anywhere near central/east side so I decided this was worth the wait.  I worked out with my trainer, showered, and stood outside for 45 minutes de-showering in the hot sun for this.  The guy who took orders (not Ric) was great, wearing a UNLV hat, very outgoing.  He said it was not a crime to get the Barby without bacon, and I said I was looking forward to the jalepenos.I also got the yaya and the caprese.  Once I ordered, the food came out very fast.  I got back to my office RIGHT when my shift started, and started eating.  Prices are fine, food was HOT, and the taste was great.  My sadness came with the lack of ANY jalepenos on the barby.  We had talked about it (I told the guy I was from Texas and I like spicy food, and that he can double the peppers to replace the bacon I didn't want).  So I guess after seeing caramelized jalepenos on the menu for 6 months, I was sad when I didn't end up with any.  Otherwise, it was fun, got it out of my system, tipped them so they all yelled, "TIP THE TRUCK" and shook it, and enjoyed what I ate.  A-OK.UPDATED 02/2011: Went back when it was near Greenspun media recently.  Girl in front of me tipped and got tip the truck luv, and I tipped and got ignored.  I ordered barby no bacon, yaya, and the special mango chutney chicken no bacon (glad he told me it had bacon) - nevertheless both sliders had bacon on them that were not supposed to.  I took the bacon off and tried the sliders.  The chicken was rotisserie style so it had a nice flavor, but mango chutney was kind of gummy.  The caramelized jalepenos I waited so long for were just like diced and nothing special.  So not only did I end up with bacon, I ended up ILL.  Not good for the next 2 days.  I definitely got this out of my system, literally and figuratively.
3	Last Friday they were behind Yogurtland on West Flamingo near the 215 from 6-9pm.We got there promptly at 6 and we met a crowd waiting for these infamous sliders. The wait was about 35-minutes. Had we shown up closer to 7:00 we would've been better off the line was practically non-existent when we left. We were greeted warmly when we placed our order, we each chose three sliders ($7) and we shared an order of sweet potato fries ($3). A short wait, later, we carried off our grub and we were anxious to dig in.First up were the Barbie, Pep Pep and Yaya. The Yaya, with tzatziki and feta was our least favorite. The other two were quite good, but it was the Barbie, with carmelized jalapenos that we enjoyed most.I like my sweet potato fries savory rather than sweet. So, it was unfortunate that the fries were dusted with cinnamon and sugar.Next were the Captain's Order, Caprese and Pulled Porkie. From these, we liked the Pulled Porkie best. The Caprese was a nice veggie option, but it would have been better if the eggplant was more tender. The balsamic on the Captain's Order overpowered the other flavors.If I happen to be hungry and at the right place at the right time, I'd try Slidin' Thru again, I'd order a trio of the Barbie, Pep Pep and Pulled Porkie.
5	What a great experience.  Not just great sliders, with a hefty portion of meat for a slider (at least the first normal-thickness patty I have ever seen on a slider!), but the crew on the truck is pretty awesome.  Fun and into what they do.  Tried the Captain's special, the Barby and sweet potato fries.  Just great flavors, well cooked perfection.  If you like a decent burger, I would recommend a stop by the truck.
5	After failing to catch up with Ric and his crew on numerous occasions, I was happy to see the Slider Truck sitting at the fall festival at Fresh52 Farmers Market. Thankfully we got there early enough that not much of a line had formed yet. I already knew what I wanted.  I had been contemplating it after reading so many reviews.  I ordered the Barbie, Pep Pep and the Pulled Porkie. I also got an order of french fries and a plain slider with ketchup for my son. I have to say that they were some of the yummiest sliders I've tasted yet.  The Pulled Porkie was definitely the favorite but the others were really good. too. My son even finished his.  The fries were nothing special but were cooked just right with a good amount of crisp.  I'll be on the lookout for the awesomeness that is the Slider Truck. Definitely something worth trying for those who love burgers.
4	i was reading some of the reviews of my fellow yelpers and i was surprised to see i forgot to write my own review ( strange thing is i was sure i wrote one ! ) I've tried the slider truck at least 5 times now from their early days of being on side streets in industrial areas, the gun store on trop, and the latest was the farmers market.  It's been a roller coaster of experiences in that even though the food has been consistently very good to excellent, at times the service ( and not just long lines ) is inconsistent.  what you gotta admire about these guys is the good attitude, the positive vibe and basically being the 1st to crack the specialty food truck trend in Las Vegas.  And I'm thankful they selected a food i truly enjoy - Sliders ! The barbie and the pulled pork are still my favs Long live the slider truck !
4	MMmmmmm, that pulled porkie.  You've got me by my heart.  It's a perfect balance.  I can't really remember what the other sandwiches are like but this one is truly memorable.
5	I finally caught up to the truck this weekend @ the comic fest at the Library on Flamingo. There were 3 different trucks there offering food. So of course I had to have some sliders. And just like Misti said..u get a fist pump from the nicest guy working there. I order the Pep Pep and was surprised at how juicy it was. And the sauce that they use is amazing and they don't drown it either. It was just right! The hubby had to do a special order cuz he is a bit picky and they had no problem with that. He was thrilled they made it perfectly. He ate them all! We had sodas from them to wash it all down. I love that they have the retro glass bottles! We are gonna try to hit them up weekly since there are so many more I want to try.
4	I heard about this place from Mix 94.1 FM host Mercedes (of Mark & Mercedes in the morning- I listen to this show every weekday morning BTW). It sounded really good plus Mercedes was talking about how excited that the truck was visiting their building vicinity (almost like a child on Christmas morning). I saw this truck at First Friday the last two months, but wasn't sure it was the same one (it was). My husband's uncle also said that they have really good sliders (also said that if you're a newbie, they rock the truck). So, it was a group of five of us. Everyone got sliders but I (not my husband) only had the sweet potato fries. Before you ask, "Why not?"- my husband is on a weight maintenance plan (he lost 110 pounds and has kept it off for 3 + years- it was not a cheat day for him- my husband told me to remind me to make that FF a cheat day for him, because he really wanted to try the sliders). I practice moderation. Anyway, the sweet potato fries were in a paper bag, a good amount/size (enough for two people to share), sprinkled with cinnamon- mmm, yummy. I love sweet potato fries- anytime that's one of the options on the menu, I get them. They were slightly crispy but not mushy (I hate that- if you get the frozen kind to prepare at home, it's tricky getting them to crisp, anyway, I digress.) The cinnamon was unexpected but gave it a nice flavor boost. I didn't think that it needed dipping sauce like ketchup or ranch. I didn't finish them- took the rest home. Our friends (two first-timers) liked the sliders- good size, fluffy buns- looked like hawaiian rolls my husband commented, and reasonably priced- $7 for three sliders (the other options around were rather pricey, for example $10 for BBQ). A good sign is that they were all kinda quiet, while eating- kinda like that Carl Jr's commercial "Don't bother me- I'm eating." There are a few variations- about four or five options on the sliders. Yup, I really want to try 'em for myself, the next time we're at FF, assuming that they'll be there (here's hoping). From the looks of the long line, it was a good sign that this was a solid reputable place to get food. Since it's a truck, no formal seating, of course, so some of us stood, while some of us used the curb.
5	Ric and the guys...and a few gals that were chillin come through big... I walk around work talking about the slider truck and how delicious it is and once they all try it they wont want another burger... It has happend.We close down our store every year for SEMA and I have a friend that had a few cars in the show so I had a chance to walk through the night before the show opend and low and behold I spoted the "TRUCKS". I let the guys at work know that lunch was at the slider Truck..  The area where the truck was opened at 9 and off we went direclty for the sliders.... Okay okay, I know 9am is a little early for slider goodness but we were excited. We ended up running into Ric and the crew and they let us know that the window was opne for Love at 10am. At 10 we were the first in line. We ordered our delicious meals and the window love began.. As the burgers came out we started to get down and man oh man I think they get better every time. Now, obvioulsy I am raving about it and I like the slider truck but the guy behind us in line ordered some sliders and they came out cooked perfectly just like ours a very slight amount of pink with all the juices flowing and this mellow dramatic cowboy from texas, which he had to make known, freaked out and spit out his mouth full of slider and threw his sliders down and threw a gigantic fit... Well I guess they do say everything is bigger in texas. No worries Ric, we were ready to take him out. You knwo what they say about texes theres only 2 things that come from there... And I know damn well he was no steer..
4	I have to echo Jim S. (and not just because I married him).  I was skeptical of getting all excited and actually driving across town to go to a food truck . . . but it is worth the drive (if you are not lucky enough to have them come to a site near you).  I enjoy being able to have a taste of a few different types of burgers without the guilt of pigging out (that reminds me, try the pulled pork!).  The sweet potato fries are yummy.  Yes, we were crazy enough to bring our own table and chairs when grabbing some burgers in an office park parking lot . . . the food is well worth an impromptu picnic!So, check their schedule and be sure to get there early (before the mystery burger of the day is sold out!).
4	We went to Slidin Thru a few months ago. We got there around 6:10 and had about a thirty minute wait. There were seven sliders to choose from. We got one of each slider except the Plane Jane and split them. They were all very good. I love that you can try a bunch of burgers since they are so small. We also got the sweet potato fries which were good but sweet enough to be more of a dessert than a side. It was worth the wait to try something new, though I don't know that I'd wait that long next time.
5	Wish there were more than 5 stars to give! The Slider Truck is not only insanely delicious and worth the drive to any part of town they happen to be on, but its also really cheap! You must try the Captain...and their sweet potato fries are to die for. Seriously...check these guys out!!!!
5	I feel like this is one of those reviews where I really have nothing new to add. I've patronized the Slider Truck about 5 times so far and am a big fan.Overall, I would say the Pep Pep and Captain's Order are my favorites. The Pep Pep is just classic - special sauce, melted cheese, bacon, etc. It's the best kind of yummy traditional burger to me. The Captain's Order is unique with the arugula, bacon, and balsamic reduction. The balsamic reduction adds so much to the flavors of the burger.The burgers themselves are cooked to perfection. So often, sliders are over-cooked, but not these. These sliders have just the right amount of thickness and juiciness.And I have to give major props for not only the concept of a slider truck, but also for the fact that you can order just 1 slider or 5 sliders that are each different. With pretty much everywhere else that has sliders, you just get 3 or 4 of the same mini-burger - you can't get just 1 or 2, and you definitely can't mix and match different burgers.Overall, this is a solid experience and I will keep coming back.
4	Best sliders in Vegas!! What else beats FRESH MADE SLIDERS?? Reasonable prices for great food, will definitely be stopping by for a bite next time we're in Vegas. I would highly recommend that you get to wherever they will be EARLY, the lines can get long and the smell will get your stomach churning!!
2	Our friend had never tried the Slider Truck and we thought it was the perfect opportunity to take his S.T. virginity. As soon as he got off work we rallied and rushed over to their spot for the night.We stood in line for over 45 minutes and left empty handed. Not only that, we were insulted by the sheer greediness of some people.It was happy hour; $1 everything. There was a big crowd but everyone was being pleasant, politely waiting their turn to gobble some slider goodness. Since they were at Sunrise Coffee, people were dipping into the shop and getting coffee while waiting. After 45 minutes, the slider guys announce that they "have 40, count 'em FORTY sliders left! Don't be greedy, please, and there'll be enough for everyone!! :D"We see an old woman leave with at least 9 sliders and a big snot-eating grin. And then- "SOLD OUT!"Within TWO customers, they went through FORTY sliders. Whuuuuuuuuhhhh?!Fact is, we probably wouldn't have been able to get a slider even if people only ordered 2-3 each. Any time you wait that long, it can be annoying, but I'm not really upset about leaving empty handed. We were all insulted by the fact that as soon as they announced the shortage, some greedy individuals felt the need to swipe up ALL of the remaining sliders for themselves. Obviously, all of us waiting in line are there because we love the Slider truck- and those greedy few hoarded them all for themselves? Really? REALLY?! Thanks, people, for crapping all over my friend's experience & ensuring that his first impression of the Slider truck is NOT positive. Some of the shimmer has been smudged for me as well. I don't think I'm going to be able to find the motivation to wait in those lines with the knowledge that people so greedy are scattered amongst our midst. I'm over it. My friend, who didn't even get to try to food, will most likely never be back because of this. Greedy fools ruining the fun for everyone, I tell ya!
4	Ok, I'm finally gonna review Slider Truck.  I've been there three times, I've tried everything, its time.  I've only visited them when they are at the MLK Costco during lunch so your experience may differ.First off, the crew is amazing!  It takes some special skills to make you happy after you've been standing in line for 30 minutes in the hot blazing sun, in an asphalt parking lot no less, waiting for a slider.  A fist bump, smile, and upbeat attitude when you get to the window... how can you be mad about being sunburned?However, I can't give this truck 5 stars because I don't like a lot of their food.  My own personal taste preference perhaps.  The barby and the pep pep pretty good.  The pulled porky is amazing.  But the rest of the sliders are kind of meh.  I love feta cheese and I really wanted to love the yaya and the captain's order, but I don't think the feta cheese is strong enough.  I don't taste any tzatiki on the yaya.  It's just not the flavor fest it should be.And I'm not a big fan of the fries.  It's odd, because I'm usually crazy for all things fried... especially potatoes.  But they put sugar on the sweet potato fries, which I don't like, and I think it passes onto the regular fries somehow, because those taste sweet, too.  I need 'em savory.  Prior visits were during the summer, at noon, and it was absolutely miserable until I got to the window.  The wait was soooo long and uncomfortable.  There were actually a few aborted attempts in Summerlin when I saw how long the line was. But I won't knock off stars, like other reviewers have, just because a business is successful.  They handle the crowds amazingly well with a good attitude and giving people notice via Twitter and verbally when they are about to run out of food.Today I visited close to 11am, which I highly recommend if possible.  No line, quick service, in and out with no fuss.  And you can get one mystery slider per person before they run out.  Today, it was teriyaki... just basically the barby with teriyaki instead of bbq sauce.  Nothing special but just as good as the barby.  I'm hoping that the mystery sliders will be more creative in the future.They have a new truck, which is much higher off the ground like Fukuburger is.  They are still working out the kinks with "Bertha."  There were no fries today because they were coming out soggy.  Since I don't like the fries, no biggie.  But there was one customer that I thought was going to have a heart attack!  He was traumatized!Also, they now have a Yelp check-in offer.  Check-in three times and you get two free sliders.  People are totally gonna cheat with this, I know.  But whatever... I'm gonna do it legit.  The check-in function does work at Costco as they have the entire 89109 zip code as their location.  But it may not work elsewhere.The new truck is up for sale according to their website, so the hope that they would double their efforts with two trucks is not to be.  But there still is the rumor that they will open a brick and mortar location.  Maybe that will take some of the demand and long lines.If it wasn't for the upbeat and fun attitude of these guys, I'd have to give them three stars.  But I adore the pulled porky and the staff is amazing so four stars it is!
5	I've been waiting for this truck to post somewhere within a 10 mile radius from my place but I got tired of waiting. So this afternoon, I looked up their website and noticed that they were going to be having a Truck Showdown or Battle??!! Yeah! It was called "Street Food Throwdown!" - Slidin Thru' VS. HanShikTacoWell, Now it really didn't matter how far they were parked because I was gonna conquer two trucks with one appetite!! I got there around 12:30ish and there was a big crowd in front of Lee's Discount Liqs.. I barely found parking and went for The Slider Truck 1st. After about a 20 minute line and 5 minute pick-up wait, this is what I got:1. Barby: melted cheddar, caramelized jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce2. Pep Pep: lettuce, tomato, crisp bacon. sauteed onion, melted cheddar and super sauce3. Yaya: lettuce tomato, red onion, feta, tzatziki and red wine vinaigrette4. Captain's Oder: roma tomato, arugula, crisp bacon, feta cheese, sauteed onion and balsamic reductionALL the Sliders were 'AAHHH SOMMMEE'!!!!! Angus Burgers were all seasoned perfectly, moist and juicy, bite tender.. Great Job! I don't have anything negative to say about their burgers whatsoever. I ordered their sweet potato tater tots and have no complaints either. * Only thing that sucked was that they ran out of pulled pork so obviously couldn't order anything with that. But what sucked even more was their  "Mystery Taco" just sold out too, by a few people in front of me in line!! Yes, Taco since they were challenging Tacos.. Pretty Cool! Its all good because I got a reason to come hunt them down again, soon!*Judges did Announce the Winner by a close margin of 3 points.. And the Winner is Vegas's Own: SLIDER TRUCK!!!!! WOO HOO!!!!! Staff were all Super Excited and Giddy, Food was Perfect and Cost was Fair!!! I'd drive the miles for this place in a heartbeat. I will be back for more, you can count on that!
2	My cousin and I were so excited to try the sliders at this truck because we had heard so many good things about them. From the reviews on yelp to word of mouth, nothing but good things other than the long lines.I arrived 45 minutes early at the Greenspun spot just so we wouldn't have to wait in a line. I was obviously the first one there. Finally the truck arrived and unfortunately they were late.We order 4 different sliders and there wasn't anything special about them. All of them were dry and needed more sauce to moisten them up.  I was also discouraged that they used French's Fried Onions rather than making their own onion strings. The both of us were very disappointed and wondered how this truck was the most popular one in Las Vegas? Slider Truck did not live up to the hype everyone was talking about. I can probably make these sliders at home and maybe even make better ones. Did we go on a bad day or something? I don't think I'll be going to this truck again anytime soon, not unless I'm already at an event they are at.
5	Really, when you talk about Slider Truck, you have to talk about two things. You have to talk about the food, and you have to talk about the experience.The burgers are Angus beef, cooked medium rare, served on soft buns, slightly toasted, and topped with a variety of delicious toppings.My favorite is the Barby, mostly for the caramelized jalapenos that are like nothing else. They perfectly complement the smoky bacon, cheddar, crispy onions and BBQ sauce that inevitably make you understand why they include a wet-nap with each order.The Pep Pep is a more standard bacon cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato and caramelized onions - "super sauce" is the only deviation from tradition. I think super sauce is watered-down ranch dressing. I definitely prefer the Barby, I think maybe the reason is I'm eating the Pep Pep second - the Barby is clearly the more flavorful burger. Don't get me wrong, they're both great - the quality of the ingredients shines through every step of the way.Then there's the service experience. Ricardo and the boys are not exactly the Soup Nazi. :) While the line moves forward you'll get an idea of the schtick here. They do an amazing job of making first-timers feel like regulars and making regulars feel like friends. They've got their own catch-phrases, which is a sign you've made it. When they talk about #windowlove, you really feel it. As you bump fists, you can tell that these guys are having a blast.Note to self: start getting to the truck earlier so that I can try the Porkie and a Mystery Slider, as I've always arrived after these limited-edition delicacies have sold out for the night.Update: I am told that the Super Sauce is not ranch dressing of any kind. Next guess: some kind of tzatziki?
5	Maybe its too early to update my review.  But I think this truck has earned five stars for it's great mystery taco.  They are considering keeping it on the "secret menu."  OMG, I hope they do!The taco (which I think they served at the Street Food Throwdown) is pork, tzatziki, feta, hot sauce, crispy onion strips, and carmelized jalapenos, all on a warm corn tortilla.  It is absolutely the best!  It's $5, but it is totally worth it.  A ton a pork.  Maybe they could make a burrito! :)Also, they have this super fun #SuperSecretSevenDaysofSlidinThruXmaspromotion going on.  Everyday, til Christmas I guess, they post a link on Twitter that gives you a secret phrase to get a discount.  Say the secret phrase, the whole truck yells it back at you, and you get some free food.  Pretty sweet!  If you don't want to join Twitter, you can see all their Twitter messages on their website - http://slidinthru.com/I still don't like the fries.  I got the sweet potato fries with salt instead of cinnamon and sugar, and they still weren't doing it for me.  I don't know why because rarely meet a fried starch that I don't like.  But the taco is seriously craveable.  Give it a try and if you like it, tell them to keep it!  PLEASE!
4	We planned to go to the Neon Museum yesterday for their open house. We saw that the Slider Truck was going to be there so immediately knew what our lunch plan was going to be.We tried the slider truck about 5 months ago and enjoyed it but weren't stoked about the 30 minute wait. This time, there was no line and we got our food within 10 minutes.We split a YaYa, Pep Pep, Barby, Pulled Porky, and the daily special (a pork taco with tzatziki). We also split an order of plain fries.Everything was very good. My favorite was the taco. The tzatziki was a very pleasant surprise in place of sour cream.The last time we went to the Slider Truck we had the sweet potato fries. I have to say I prefer the plain fries. Don't get me wrong, the sweet potato fries are great, but I'm not a big fan of sweets. The plain fries had a nice balance of salt and pepper and were a great accompaniment to the sliders. Whereas the sweet potato fries were more of an after-slider dessert.
4	So very good sliders. The price is decent and I really like all the burgers and the sweet potato fries are almost like desert/ So good. The pulled pork is always out though but one of these days I will get you. They really need an Android app with working latitude to follow though easier than Twitter.
4	I finally went, yay!I have to admit, I've been dragging my feet on trying this place. I have two reasons for the delay. First, I haven't really gotten into the food truck craze. I can't help it, I really like sit down restaurants. I enjoy making dining an event. Although I do love me some Fuku. Second, I have heard a lot about the social aspect of the Slider Truck and that made me shy away as well. I may be weird, but I like a little anonymity with my meal. I don't really want to play around or be "on," so to speak.I felt I had procrastinated enough, so after much hemming and hawing, I made my way out on a very rainy evening and I couldn't be happier that I did. There was no line and we were only one of two groups of customers here at the time. We ordered and we did have a nice little chit chat with the guys and luckily, I had a really nice experience.Me and my guy tried just about every slider they have, minus the caprese, since I hadn't heard too many good things about it. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries and the Mystery Slider, which happened to be turkey pastrami, which I wasn't really a fan of. The Captain's Order and the Yaya were my favorites. I also really liked the porky. Yum. The sweet potato fries were exactly how I like them, more on the sweet than savory side with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. Some honey drizzled on top of that would make it an even bigger hit with me. I'll definitely be back.
5	When I first heard about Slidin Thru, I had to find them and check it out.  My first order was a Caprese, Ya Ya, and a Pep Pep.  With a big glass bottle of Coca Cola.  I was definitely surprised by the quality of the sliders and the service.  These guys are doing big things and every customer helps out!  Keep up the good work!
4	First timer, and it was good. Creative sliders here- these are not bachi-sized. Prefer it over bachi, cuz te repitoire is bigger (Greek,BBQ, not Just Asian inspired burgers. Overheard the truck guys saying they're opening up a restaurant next year. I'm more excited about that - I don't have time to chase a burger truck throughout the valley. No line at 7:45pm Thursday night, outside my gym, ha.
5	I can't believe I keep forgetting to review the Slider Truck. My husband and I have synchronized cravings for this place sometimes and have to find where they're parked. My favorite is the Barbie. Bacon burgers aren't my thing, but the combo of the bacon, jalapenos, crispy onions and cheddar is burger nirvana for me. Phil loves the burgers, but is in love with the Pulled Porkie. Super tender pulled pork, with caramelized jalapenos and barbecue  sauce...I love this one too. They also serve up a massive bag of sweet potato fries seasoned with a cinnamon/sugar shake. I like a bit of heat with my sweet, so I like to add a couple shakes of cayenne to the bag and give it a toss. So good! Just as good as the bangin' sliders is the staff. Always friendly, always a good vibe. Our kids love it too. (they have a yelp acct now and have beat me to the punch reviewing this place)Pull up their website, check the skedgie and go get yourself sum windowlove!
3	Follow that truck.  Can't miss it, very colorful and eye catching.  Owner is some guy with black rimmed glasses - super nice guy and serves some bad a... burgers.  Too bad i can't try the meat burgers, the caprese is pretty good and crispy fries.
3	I was introduced to the Slider Truck awhile back by fellow Yelper and coworker, Nelson Q. Before Slider Truck, I have only heard/read about the whole food truck trend in NY and LA. So I was eager to give it try when Nelson tracked them down to a strip mall near my home. After waiting about 10 minutes in the 100F+ heat, it was finally my turn to place my order with Ric. I remember trying the Captain's Order, Yaya, and Pulled Porkie.  The food was alright to me, felt that the burgers back then was a little dry and could use a little more sauce.  But I wholeheartedly support the entrepreneurial spirit of these Las Vegas culinary students jumping with both feet in on this food truck trend sweeping the country.  Ric was awesome and made every customer feel like VIPs.  And at 3 sliders for $7 (1 slider = $3, 2 sliders = $5) + $2 regular fries or $3 sweet potato fries, it was an inexpensive and unique dining experience.And on Thursday I decided to go again because class let out earlier than expected, plus I have some Groupons that I finally printed and they were at the Cox Communications building off of Rancho @95.  When I arrived there was a decent line, and some people enjoying their sliders on the collapsable chairs they have brought with them (they must be pros at this whole food truck dining thing). It turns out that it was Ric's birthday and he was giving away these mini slider desserts to customers. It looks like a miniature hamburger, and I thought it would be cool to take a picture of it before polishing it off.So after waiting for maybe 20-25 minutes, someone other than Ric finally took my order (Captain's Order, Barbie, Pep Pep and their Sweet Potato Fries) and I handed over my Groupon worth $10.  Pretty good deal having paid $5 for the Groupon offer.  He was nice enough, but I wasn't offered the mini hamburger dessert cake. I guess they were starting to ration it, because while I waited for my order to be prepared it was only offered to some of the girls in line.Anyway, My Captain's Order was flavorful and a lot more moist and juicy this time around.  I also liked the Barbie with the flavorful BBQ sauce. But the YaYa was no good (tiny patty that was gone after 2 bites and leaving more than half the bread).  2 out of 3 ain't bad.  And the Sweet Potato Fries with the contrasting sweet and salty taste was enjoyable as a dessert snack. The mystery slider that I have tried was good (Roast Beef with Cheese, and they are more generous with the roast beef on the slider).I bought a total of 4 Groupons since my first visit so I can really experience the Slider Truck.  And aside from seeing their loyal followings that would wait for the truck before their scheduled arrival (pretty cool), I have also experienced a few late arrivals (not cool - especially on cold winter evenings), fairly long lines, but they are getting better at fulfilling orders quicker.Overall, I think the food served is alright.  And in general I would prefer a stationary location, instead of tracking them down and hoping they will actually be there when I feel like having some sliders.  But that is just me.
5	Figured my very first review should be for one of my favorite places ( all over town ) I have been a devotee of Slidinthru since the first tweet letting me know that they were going to be serving up some yummy sliders over a year ago. Since then I have actually taken the sliders all the way to NY and shared them with my family who loved them as well. Ric and the guys are always on point, funny as all get up and the food is always good ... no wait ... Great.   More than anything they take everything lightly and strive to make their customers happy.
4	Finally...Kuge will REVIEEEEEEEW....Slider Truck1st off, Kuge will say that everyone should have eventually break their slider truck cherry because he believes that the food is consistently delicious and with reasonable pricing, it's a great value.Kuge has been to Slider Truck probably 8+ times now and has had many different kinds of experiences, most of them good.  Because The People's Champ loves to please fans, he will simply go about the pro's and cons about this mobile establishment.Pros:- Food = Delicious, Kuge especially is in love with the pulled porkies, and their fries.  - Price = Reasonable, as others mentioned they have the 2 for $5, and 3 for $7 slider deals that are essentially the nuts.  But on top of that they occasionally run special deals if you follow them on twitter.- Atmosphere = Fun, Every time Kuge is ready to order his food, everyone working at slider truck always brings in a lot of energy and fun, you can't help but give'em window love whenever you order food.Cons:- Waiting times.  Now, before all you Slider Truck fanatics get all, "Kuge, it's part of the dynamic of going to a food truck so of course you should expect to wait".  Kuge would like to say he understands that aspect, but Kuge also understands that when Slider Truck says they will be at a place at 6pm, and they should not show up 15-20 minutes later, then have 15-30 people vulture around the place because of the delay, and have to wait 30-45 minutes to get food, he's gonna be a little upset.  Even though The Great One's time isn't valuable, he would like to think it is!- Inconsistency with what they have available.  There were a couple times where Kuge would want his favorite pulled porkies and fries, only to find out that they don't have either available.  On top of that, Kuge also would go back to his previous con of waiting, nothing is worse than waiting in line for 20-30 minutes only to find out that the food you want is not available.Despite these cons, Kuge acknowledges that these instances don't happen often and for the most part his experiences are good.  But he cannot overlook these cons so they get knocked down a peg.Kuge will check down in The Smack Down Hotel, but not before he gives Slider Truck 4 Stars out of 5.
5	Kickass fries & amazingly fast, tasty and magical gourmet burgers, all coming out of a stylish retro comic-painted truck. Sprinkle on the wild, crazy awesome guys working inside the truck. If that's not a recipe for success, I don't know what is.
3	Another overrated place in Las Vegas. I'm beginning to think people here have poor tastes in food.I ordered the Pulled Porky, Pep Pep, and the YaYa. The beef and the pork were pretty dry. If the meat was cooked better, I think the combination of flavors would be pretty decent and I'd give this place 4 stars. Otherwise...meh. I saw In N Out on the way to this food truck and totally regret not going there instead.
2	On one cold day during lunch about a month ago, I was super hungry and excited for sliders from the slider truck.  I stood in line in the Costco parking lot on MLK for 20 minutes anticipating for my turn to order.  I have no problems waiting for good food.  If the food is good, I'm willing to wait it out.  I like my food hot, fresh and yummie.  The sliders were hot and fresh but the quality went downhill.  The pulled porkie was the same but I think the quality of their ground beef and other ingredients went downhill.  I was so so disappointed.  I really like these guys too.  How sad, I used to be such a frequent customer. -M2
5	OMG!! If you haven't been or heard of the slider truck. Go and find it now! I heard they also have a permeant place in town. The sliders or delish! My favorite is  the Barby! --- But they have great fries too and mystery sliders every day -- Plus they're a bunch of fun guys :)
5	The slider truck is aaaaamazing! My boyfriend had been raving about it forever and I couldn't wait to try it! I finally had the joy of eating those delicious sliders last week and LOVED them! I had three sliders - the barby, pep pep, and yaya and then shared a side of sweet potato fries. Each slider was absolutely delicious and you could literally taste every single component of each. My favorite one was the yaya - it was so refreshing and I really enjoyed the feta cheese. The sweet potato fries were covered in sugar and cinnamon.... enough said! Not to mention, the slider truck guys are incredibly nice, happy, and friendly. We didn't have any cash on us, so we were forced to pay with a card. They then told us that their machine stopped working and they were only taking cash. Bummer! BUT, much to our surprise, they explained that they could give us an "I O LOU", trusting that we would come back later to pay. whaaat!? awesome! We accepted the ridiculous offer and enjoyed our sliders. Later that night, we went to their next location to pay back the "I O LOU" and decided to get even more sliders, which this time included the pulled porky (yum, yum, yum). Overall, absolutely love the food and the service! WOOOHOOO slider truck!
2	Call me a hater but I'm not about to start giving away superfluous high marks to restaurants simply because their business model puts them on wheels.  I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.Like I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  The guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.  If you pay by credit card, the order taker says "My machine is asking if you would like to leave a tip."  I understand his machine may be asking that, but maybe post a sign that say you can leave a tip when paying by debit or credit rather than put people on the spot.   Jeez, thanks for putting me in a pickle.  I mean are you going to tell the guy no straight to his face?  I just think thats a tad audacious.  My visit corresponded with their new semi-residency at lunch time on Thursdays at UNLV.  Don't let the wheels seduce you...
3	3.5 stars. Slider Truck offers cute, tasty, almost bite-size burgers for a modest price. Although, you might have to wait in line for quite a while.The planets must've aligned because my schedule and Slider Truck's schedule were not conflicted. So I struck while the iron was hot and got in line once class was over. A line was already forming and I have to admit, wait time was a bit long. I've noticed that ST has developed a loyal following in the valley and when you add that food trucks are in vogue, waiting is ultimately inevitable. In the meantime, the truck is blasting the latest hip-hop jams and even the workers are breaking it down inside their little mobile. Amusingly, the truck was bouncing because of the dancing inside. LOL! Once I got to the front, the guy fist jabbed me and was friendly and asked what I wanted. I ordered 3 sliders (Barbie, Pep Pep, and Yaya), side of fries, and smart water. Total was $11, a bit steep in my opinion. But I totally understand, because they're in their embryonic stage and haven't reached McDonald's stage, yet. Shortly thereafter, I got my food and began to dig in. All three burgers were juicy and packed with toppings within a nice bun. My favorite was the Barby. I loved the fried onions with the bbq sauce and jalapeno. My fries were fries. Not spectacular but decent. It's hard to fuck up fries. A sweet potato fry managed to sneak in with my order and I regret not ordering it because it had more flavor and crunch. All the hype that surrounds this truck gave me high expectations, so maybe that's why I felt a bit disappointed. Service was personable and they really try to make you feel included, I think. My food was good, but I felt I could've gotten it cheaper somewhere else with the same or better quality. But their menu is interesting enough for me to go for round 2.
5	Love the sliders guys! Bring it to lake mead and rainbow!
5	I don't think I could ever say good enough things about the Slider Truck, but I will try. I love being greeted with a fist bump and a smile. It's so refreshing to see people enjoy what they do for a change. The atmosphere is so positive I swear you can almost taste it in their food! My favorites are the Pep Pep, Yaya, and the Barby. A little on the pricey side, but I think it's worth it to support a local growing business. I wish I could have a full size version of their burgers. One slider just isn't doing it for me anymore. It is nice though if you are a Slidin' Thru newbie so you can try several of their flavors all in one sitting. If you are discouraged by long lines hit them up during the week for lunch hours. I've waited over an hour for these burgers though and they are worth it. Slidin' Thru is a MUST TRY at least once for all Vegas locals!
4	I'm a fan of the sliders (not so much the sweet potato fries) but the environment of the truck and the energy of the guys really sells the food too and makes it a fun experience. 3 sliders for $7, not including the mystery of the day - they also have Fanta and Coke in glass bottles - YAY! Sure, you could go to a fast food place down the road and get a burger for $2.00 but I love the entire concept that they have going on and am a supporter of these guys! I don't mind paying more for the experience of the food truck and am excited they are opening a restaurant!
5	These guys have incredible sliders with matching personalities! Looking forward to them coming to husbands tattoo shop again next month for their food battle!Holla!! Studio 21 tattoo!!!!
5	Finally checked this truck out today and wasn't disappointed...definitely lived up to the hype! I had two Pep Peps and they were fantastic. I just love grilled onions and they were plentiful. The lettuce and bacon were crisp and the tomato was juicy. No doubt this place makes quality sliders - a must try, and I will be back when they're in my 'hood.
5	They are awesome! Great prices, great food and cool dudes! It is such a great experience...The sliders are so juicy and filling. 2 for $5 or 3 for $7. My husband loves the Pulled Porky and I love the Captains Order. You gotta try them! Best sliders I have ever had. My husband and I are now "followers"
5	One of my friends asked me to get sliders from the Sildin' Thru truck, and at the time, I thought to myself "what's the big deal about sliders?"  However, that time I went, along with each successive time I have gone, I have always been greeted with the delicious smell of sliders and fries and the obligatory fist bumps from the workers and owner (who does drive along with the crew).  Food trucks are a bit of a recent phenomenon here in the valley, and Slidin Thru is one of the trucks trying to capture that popularity like what you would see in Los Angeles.My personal favorite slider is the Barby, a western style slider with bacon, bbq sauce and crispy onion strings.  They make each order fresh, so it does take awhile, but again, that's a good thing.  They also have mystery sliders which vary at every location.  The one time I got a mystery slider, the pastraminator (a slider loaded with cooked pastrami), I was simply amazed.  The fries are great too, and they put some special seasoning on them which tastes delicious.You can tell that the owner cares greatly about his customers.  Customer service is top notch, and he frequently communicates to people via twitter and facebook.  That alone is one of the reasons that keeps me coming back.Since they opened their permanent 24 hours headquarters they cut back a bit on their truck hours and locations.  I have yet to go to the HQ, but I do prefer actually driving to the truck.  I like the adventure of actually finding the truck, and eating inside your car or on the curb.  When I actually visit the HQ, I will post a review on that page.For what it's worth, you owe it to yourself, local or tourist, to make at least one stop at the Slidin Thru truck.  And it's a mobile truck that belongs to our city :).PROS:One of the first food trucks here in VegasAmazing customer service and interactionReasonable pricesDelicious foodUsually touch each area of the city every weekCONS:You can be there awhile with long lines and the fact that they make your food to order.  But then again, not necessarily a bad thing :).THE VERDICT:  I am addicted to this place!
5	Let's not talk about food for a second, let's talk about service. The Slidin' Thru posse took the mean streets of Vegas and have managed to create a fun, friendly, and tasty atmosphere everywhere they have went. From knucklebumps to windowlove to gettin tipsy, the environment surrounding the Slider Truck is just rad.The Slider Truck was my first experience with street food. I'm now a fan street food and a fan of theirs for life. Their sliders might be some of the best burgers I've ever tasted. The ingredients are fresh, everything is made to order, and they provide amazing customer service. When I buy a burger from these guys I can tell that they really appreciate my business. The appreciation is further shown by them when I take a bite of those delicious little sliders of awesomeness and my taste buds begin doing backflips.I believe in what these guys are doing and how they are doing it. They deserve all of the success they have had. They could put on a clinic on how to succeed in modern business.#windowlove
5	One of the best food trucks in Vegas, plus now they have an awesome HQ.  So glad that they're doing well.  I have never been disappointed with any of their sliders, and always enjoy trying their mystery sliders every time I stop by.  Also, they do these crazy awesome fries at their HQ, and even have these sweet potato s'more fries, which are actually really good.
4	FUN. TASTY. Usually, those two adjectives wouldn't go together.  Fun, I think peter piper's pizza or Joe's Crab  Shack.  Tasty, I think hole-in-the-wall-dirty-poor-service.  However, the Slider Truck combined both!The atmosphere:The guys working there were fist bumpin' friendly and made the atmosphere so festive.  Given that it was for the food truck battle and the atmosphere was totally festive, but I think they have the fist bumpin' friendly as their MO.  They even have the fist bump logo wrapped on the truck!The food:Though there were a tons of people on line to order, we probably got our food within 10 minutes.  1.  Pipin' hot fries simply seasoned with salt and pepper.2.  Barby - cheddar, jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bbq sauce and BACOooooon.  Fantastic flavor blast of salty and tangy with texturegasm of the crispy fried onion strips.3.  Pep Pep - your classic burger of BLT+sauteed onions + super sauce.  It's like your best classic In-N-Out burger fun sized and flavor amplified.4.  Captain's Order - tomato, arugula, BACooooon, feta cheese and balsamic vinegar reduction.  this was my least favorite because I have a bias against the balsamic reduction being too sweet.Conclusion: Fukuburger has some mad competition.  Yum burgers.  Try them all.
4	Roaming around the Las Vegas Convention center you see a ton of different places to eat, but not one of them look appetizing (except Starbucks). So, when I noticed the slidinthru truck, I was interested to try what they had to offer. I figured, anything would be better than convention food. I was (of course) right!! These sliders were very yummy. The burgers were fresh/super moist and topped with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, bacon, cheese (optional), and their secret sauce. A little burger with a big impact! The fries are really good too - they kind of taste like Burger King with half the grease. Fresh, crispy, and delicious. Makes me wish we had one of these trucks in my neighborhood!!
4	Food trucks are sprouting up all over Las Vegas lately.  By my last count there are at least 10 now serving a wide variety of things from burgers to coffee.  The Slidin' Thru truck was one of the very first, if not thee first.I have tried it twice so far.  The first time I tried a "Barby" and a "YaYa."  I know, I know, you're saying to yourself, "Geez, you ate two burgers?  What a pig!"  You have to know that the place is called Slidin Thru, though, because their burgers are mini-burgers known as "sliders"  So I ate two but they are small.  I could eat 5 if I was really hungry!  Both of these burgers were very good and full of flavor.  I particularly enjoyed the "YaYa" which had a very unique flavor for a burger.The second time I went, I just ordered two YaYa's because that was my favorite.  On this occasion, the burgers still had good flavor but weren't quite as juicy as the first time.  I don't know why.  A little dry for my taste but still good.I would recommend trying this place out because you will get a hamburger that is quite different from the norm.
5	Love everything about the slider truck! The delicious & unique food, the spectacular service & the fun & hip street food ambience. Great chefs here & the coolest people. I like how they are always smiling even when they're super busy. So far, I've had the Caprese, Pep Pep, Yaya,  mystery shroom  slider, hash & egg slider, sweet potato fries, s'more sweet potato fries, & a special cheesecake of the day. Everything I had there was all good!  My favorites has to be the Caprese because I love eggplants & the Yaya because of the whole concoction of the feta cheese, onions, tomatoes & tzatziki sauce. Super bomb & great price! Just one of these slider w/ those yummy sweet potato fries is more than enough to fill me up.  It's cool that they always have a new mystery slider. Everytime I see their tweets about the mystery slider of the day, my mouth waters. I like how they have coke bottles that use real sugar instead of the high fructose corn syrup. The high fructose corn syrup gives me a stomach ache for some reason. So it's a major plus that they carry those pure sugar cane cokes. Definitely come back to try the other sliders I haven't tried. Craving these slider as I type.
5	I have to do an update after my latest experience. Love this food truck experience! The neat thing about StrEATS is not only the damn good eats, but also seeing all the trucks side-by-side. And the slider truck really shines. They have the art of the food truck down to a science. There is no line too long. No glitch too big. Nothing overwhelms or stops the slider truck. And all of the staff are always so friendly and enthusiastic. And the mystery slider at the latest StrEATS totally rocked. It was basically the Yaya, but all kicked up a serious mega notch. The added hot sauce (and/or whatever they did) was absolute mini-burg perfection. Who would've known that feta and red wine vinaigrette and hot sauce would all mingle together so gloriously.
5	If you just want some #window love and/or food packed w flavor,.......you need to catch Slidin thru as it makes it way through town during the week.They treat you like family, and the sliders are outstanding! I always get The Barby, The Captain....and the mystery slider. You never know what that may be, but its fun to try new stuff and I have NEVER been disappointed! They also have an eggplant slider that is outstanding.the Caprese. Always remember to give em some of that window love when picking up your food!
5	Food is bomb and these guys always know how to have a good time.
4	Came back and almost dropped dead of caprese nirvana. It's finals week. I read a tweet this is Slider's last hurrah at UNLV (until next semester) Visiting was inevitable. Hungry, fatigued, and tired of reading, I ordered and inhaled the caprese slider. No line, workers were very cool, and now I must add their HQ on my list of places to visit.
4	I can't believe today was my first time to officially Slider Truck... I've been following them for some time now - but even with them on campus, I've always had other plans on Thursday.  Today, it turns out was their last day on campus - and so the stars aligned, and I was there... ordered 3: Barby: loved the jalapenos on it and the crispy onions;  the Porky: winner!  again, those jalapenos rule - but this is what a slider should be, tender, juicy, by far the best meat:bun ratio; Mushroom special:  meh.  balsamic was too strong, totally overwhelming any truffle flavor or smell, the burger itself was overcooked and dry so it was tiny and therefore, too much bun.  The fries were perfect.  Truly perfect.2 out of 3 ain't bad... I'd definitely go back - and by the way, Nick, you're darling.  I love your customer service...and your ability to focus on each guest one at a time, enthusiastically, but still gently, and with pride.  Congratulations on all your success guys... you deserve it.  yes, I'm a fan!
4	I've been here several times when the slider truck rolled through the UNLV campus, and their $3 tacos are what I usually order. Their tacos are simple, not too filling to feel like you've overeaten, and they're cheap when you're in a rush to your next class, or you want something simple and quick while you're on campus in between classes. They usually park next to the library, so its convenient in regards to you're right next to the Coffee Bean by Lied. I haven't really ventured into their other items on the menu, but their tacos are what keeps me coming back!
4	I tried them again at the Food Truck Fest II and definitely a much more enjoyable experience compared to the last time. I had the Barbie and the Pep Pep, which were both awesome. Each of them were moist and weren't dry all all. So I was able to truly appreciated the flavors blending with the sweetness of the bread, which I absolutely loved! I was also suprised at the thickness of the patties because I don't remember them being as meaty as this. The food also came out prompty with very little wait. For some reason the service at the truck is better compared to HQ.  I also like the fact that they accept debit, which is rare for most trucks.  So after this, Slidin' Thru will be seeing more of me!
4	Caught them at Food Truck Fest 2 -- rad times ensued!  Their sliders are big and individualized, no fear of overlapping if you order randomly!  The Pep Pep is my favorite.  Add in Mexican Cokes on ice?  That's always a plus.
5	The food was good . Rick is a really nice guy. The wait is worth it if its not 110th out. Try the pulled pork to die for. There new HQ is even better then the truck and they don't run out of pork like the truck.
4	Small, but delicious.I ordered 2 Barby burgers. Spicy, but not too spicy. A little bit too much BBQ sauce, but that's okay. I just wish they weren't so small. So good, but so not filling. It's unfortunate.I really would like to try the Pep Pep and the pulled pork slider next time.
5	I heard about these guys and read the reviews about them. It seems no one gave bad reviews about the food. Most of the complaints were about wait time. So I decided to try it for myself. I drove to their lunch hour stop off Sahara. I got there 30 minutes before closing time. So I guess I missed the rush hour. I ordered immediately, waited a few minutes and had some of the best burgers in town. I recommend SLIDIN. They are worth the trip.
5	I love them, so much. Even if the sliders weren't fantastic, the upbeat customer service would still leave me smiling. But really, their sliders are great! My fave is the barby and the pep pep. I love the fries, too. Still haven't had the sweet potato fries, but I will be stalking them in the near future for some.
4	I took my mom, sister, and niece to the Slider Truck at the Farmers' Market on Eastern and Richmar (Serene-ish). My niece was flabbergasted by the "little sammiches truck," and pretty much made me order everything on the menu... including a nice little surprise that wasn't listed! (Always ask if there is a special not on the list... you could be pleasantly surprised!)I have two favorites... one being the Pulled Porky (listed as a specialty slider - limited time?) with jalapenos. Spicy and sweet - one of my all time favorite combinations - with a nice hit (slightly more than a hint?) of spice that gives a nice depth to the flavors. The Barby, another pork BBQ sandwich, is pretty amazing, too. Who doesn't love all of these flavors... with bacon?!I also love the caprese slider (also listed as a special). The eggplant is a great "meat" and the combination tastes fabulous. Really fresh and lighter than I expected, it's a great summer day option. The Yaya was a close second to the Pulled Porky/Barby faves... but this Greek gal is a sucker for feta and red onions. The vinaigrette has a great pop to it.The Plain Jane is anything but. Maybe not a specialized combination/recipe, it is still done well and very tasty.The fries are fries. Not bad, but nothing that made me think, "Wow, they really did a great job by _________." They're fries, they're hot. They needed just a bit more salt.Service is upbeat, personable and sometimes humorous. The truck and service areas are always clean and have everything you need to make sure you enjoy your meal to the fullest.
5	When I first heard all the positive reviews for Slidin' Thru, I thought "Man, it can't be that good. I get it, it's alright, but to stalk it through town?! No way!" That was then. Now I wonder why someone didn't kidnap me and FORCE me to find ST with them! It's really good!I recently had ST for the first time, at an UYE, no less, and fell in love with it in about 2.3890 nano seconds. The truck alone, like, the actual truck, is awesome. It looks like a comic book on wheels, but also one that puts out awesome food, smells like happiness, and is full of friendly people. I ordered the Pulled Porky, as pulled pork has been one of my favorites ever since ever. I also ordered the mystery slider, as there's no way I could pass up a mystery sandwich. Will it have pork and lettuce? Turkey and cheese? Maybe even meat and three kinds of cheese?! In my particular instance, it was turkey, cranberry, cheese, some sort of green, and was quite delicious. I would love to ooohh and ahhh about how cool the mystery sandwich concept was, until my friend pointed out that it was just their special they had going on... something she called "Thanksgiving in a bun." Still, it was a tall slider, and definitely a great bang-to-buck ratio. As far as the wait goes... there was none. Granted the crowd wasn't massive, so maybe I just got lucky. But still. Even if I had waited 5 times as long, it would've been worth it for deliciousness served on the quick.
5	I've been wanting to try Slidin Thru for awhile so I was happy to hear that they were going to be at the Yelp Birthday Suit event. One of my goodies from the event was a $5.00 credit that would be good for two sliders. I was greeted with a fist bump before I placed my order ...that was fun! I ordered the "Barby" which had cheddar cheese , jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, BBQ sauce and bacon. My second choice was the "Pep Pep" which had bacon, lettuce , tomato, sauteed onions and their "Special Sauce" . I wanted to order some fries but they only take cash ..... I just had plastic. My plan was to take them home and share one with my hubby but that fell through because I ate them before he got home. They were so good ! I couldn't help myself. Plan B would be to go on a mission with the hubby to get more sliders and would love to try the fries!
4	Tried it for first time tonight myself -- I did carry out one other time for a family member. Tonight, I brought a caprese slider home to eggplant-loving husband.  Devoured my delicious "pep pep" w/half the bun and just the right combo of ingredients. A delicious treat and terrific service.
5	These sliders are A-Maze-Ing!!!  Good variety of burgers.  The Caprese is a surprise and welcome change from a regular burger.  The Pep was really good as was the Barby.The Sweet potato fries should be called Sweet Potato Tater Tots of Goodness!!  These things were like mini churros bites in your mouth.  A touch of cinnamon on the sweet potato tots, soooooo goood.The staff is super friendly and the food speaks for itself.Can't wait to go the HQ and try out the restaurant versions.  I'm sure they're just as great!
4	I'm yelping with my mouth full right now. This review is for the HQ. I drive past this place at least 2x every week and never knew it was here. It's around the corner from the big Post Office. Barby - flavor explosion in my mouth. Crispy onions add a nice texture. This was my favorite of today's sliders. Captain's order - unique flavors. Very goodPep pep - the more traditional of today's sliders. Very good tooSweet potato fries - excellentCan't wait to come back. Highly recommend to all. Service was excellent
5	How can you not love the Slidin' Thru? The food truck that really jump started the food truck craze here in Vegas has good reason to be one of the most popular food trucks. Firstly I'd like to point out how friendly the staff are. They're always upbeat and energetic and I love that they give out fist bumps like candy. On more than one occasion I've ordered a slider that they ran out of supplies for but to make up for it they gave me a coupon for a free slider. Now that's customer service!The Pep Pep, Yaya, and Barby aren't just gibbersih, they're the unique names given to a few of their unique sliders. Ranging from the vegatarian eggplant Caprese to the caramlized, bbq sauce, fried onion strip, and bacon covered Barby. My personal favorite being the gyro-esque Yaya with feta cheese, red wine vinaigrette, and tzatziki sauce. They have a slider to suit any palette and they are suprisingly consistant. Everytime I've ordered a slider it tasted just like my previous visit's sliders. I have never witnessed a badly made slider at Slidin' Thru.Last time I was there the prices were $3 for one slider, $5 for two, and $7 for three. Its in line with the average food truck price. Not a crazy amount of food for the money but its more than reasonable considering the quality.Now, I've tried sliders at a few restaurants and I have to say that sliders from Slidin' Thru are plainly put, better. Maybe it's because restaurants don't put enough focus and effort into their sliders or maybe because Slidin' Thru just makes a mean slider. All I know is that I'll be coming back, and often.As a bit of a side note, they have soda bottles that use real sugar instead of this high fructose corn syrup crap. You really can taste the difference and its delicious.
5	I couldn't wait to review this place, er, truck!  I'm so glad I drove out to the middle of no where Vegas to get sliders. Fresh fresh fresh and reasonably priced. If you have the opportunity to try them out you should and don't be afraid to try something new...these guys are great!  Now, how can I remove BBQ sauce from my phone screen....
5	Someone slap me for waiting as long as I did to try Slidin' Thru! I had heard great things about the truck here on Yelp, but the idea of trying to track down a truck to buy lunch just seemed a little ridiculous to me. And then Misti arranged a CMYE where attendees were able to try the truck for free... And boom, just like that I was hooked.2 regular sliders are a measly $5, coupled with an order of the AMAZING sweet potato tots and you have a great lunch. My favorite sliders are the pulled porky (extra sauce please!!) and the pep pep. What really bumps this truck up from a 4 star place to a 5 star, this is as good as it gets kinda business is the service. The guys that work the truck are awesome, always super friendly and funny. It's really a pleasure to be able to support a local business like Slidin' Thru. Til next time (which will probably be next week!)  #windowlove
4	I went there last week and they were giving the cutest tiny menus ever :)Definitely a must do while you're in vegas, since there's hardly any great food (besides the tourist-y, expensive strip buffets and restaurants)..and believe me, they get boring and gross after a while if you live in Vegas. I want to give this a 4 1/2 but yelp won't let me :(Barby- LOVED IT! Seriously I think that was my favorite!! I wish I had got more of it! The sauce and carmelized jalapeno made the meat more juicy and less dryCaptain's Order--ehh not so great. I guess I got myself worked up too much. I wanted something with vegetables in it (maybe I should have got the Pep Pep) But it was so dry! There was some sauteed onion in it, but not enough for me..I was so thirsty while eating it. And it just ruined the whole slider.Pulled Porky--I took a bite off a friend's. I loved it :) very juicy, but alas I wanted some more veggies in it.Caprese--My sister ordered. Took a bite. It was pretty good :)Sweet potato fries--I tried them from my friend........AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS. Happiness in my mouth.  It was like having dessert and lunch time food at the same time. I wish I bought some, but I was in rush again.  Next time, I hope to try the Pep Pep , Yaya, and Barby again and give them a 5!
5	Pep Pep was my choice of indulgence with an enormous amount of fries! Everything was fresh and on point. They gave me some greats laughs  regarding there new Food Network fame. Very cool great group of guys. The best part in my book, I didn't have 2 break the bank!
5	Mmmmm, best mini burgers in the city!
5	What a pleasant surprise to see the Slidin Thru truck in a church parking lot when I was on a hunt for Sno Ono. First off the guys in the truck are so amazingly nice and fun. They really look like they love their job which is awesome because I am sure its 150 degrees in there!The food is great. I shared a Porky and Barby with the bf!.Two sharing was a good size but I probably could have eaten both myself! I couldn't believe this yummyness was coming from a food truck.. I want to try all of the options on the menu.. Will be back!
5	yum, yum, yum, yum!!!!YUM #1: yaya angus slider: lettuce. tomato. red onion. feta cheese. tzatziki. red wine vinaigrette. YUM #2: caprese slider: grilled eggplant. roma tomato. basil. fresh mozzarella. balsalmic reduction. YUM #3: check in on yelp and get a free slider :O) YUM #4: the price!I can't wait to add more yums to this list...I just need an empty belly and a trip back to vegas!
3	For a Slider Truck, it's okay. The food tastes pretty good and the portions for some of their items are actually pretty big. I personally had the Barby and the Pep Pep and would gladly order them again.However, the wait times for some of their food is a little ridiculous. Even though it's a slider truck, I don't think I'm going to wait 30 minutes for food when there isn't a large line in front of me. Minus One Star.The worst part though, is watching people who order way after you and get their food BEFORE you. And we're not talking about the logical "They ordered less food or they ordered less complicated food", but it stings when someone gets a huge order of 5-10 sliders before your one slider with fries after you've been waiting for over 30 minutes.The food is good, but the service could be a lot better.
5	I first experienced Slidin' Thru today at the Asian Festival and I have got to say that it was the best thing ever in the whole Festival! I would haunt this yummilicious truck thru the whole USA! Their sliders are the perfect size, packed with a punch of flavors! I had never tasted such a great "mini burger." They are so perfect you can try a few for your first time. The guys were so much fun, super rad and they look like they enjoy working, you know your food is going to come out just right! 5-stars all the way...geniuses...best flavor in Valley!
5	One word. Porkie! Get it and love it. You'll thank me later. I've been following the slidin thru truck for over a year now and have been getting the porkie and barbie every time I go which is atleast once a week if not more. The porkie is just what it sounds like and the barbie is a BBQ bacon cheeseburger with crispy fired onions. These guys know what's up when it comes to mini burgers and the fries are always a nice compliment to any mini burg. What I suggest since they are mini burgers is that if your hungry you order 3 and worry about what's not left over after if you catch my drift. Don't forget to give the "DAP" at the window or as they like to call it "Window Love". These guys have been doing it big ever since they got on the streets of Las Vegas and are they aren't about to stop as they are about to open two brick and mortar locations in the near future, heck they might even have another one poppin off by the time I finish typing this review.  They also started a little event called vegas streats and if you don't know you should. Google it.  Find these guys all over the vegas valley day and night rain or shine and if you can't catch the truck, well then be sure to stop by one of their new locations opening before 2012. Long time follower, first time reviewerVegas Villain
4	The pulled pork sandwiches were decent. Could of used a little more sauce and seemed a little salty. Definitely a fan of the Sweet potatoe tater tots. The wait wasnt long either.
5	YUM.Sliders are probably the latest fad in novelty food. They're kinda like cupcakes- miniature versions its larger predecessor, but much cuter and much more expensive. Still, doesn't stop us from buying into it right?I had the plain the the crazy one. The plain was delicious- perfectly cooked burger, not dried out like sliders usually are, topped with a little cheese, on a cute little bun. Simple enough.The Crazy One however... HOLY CRAP. Pork tenderloin, apple slaw, onion straws, bacon.... this was really quite spectacular. They made it in honor of steve jobs, and it certainly does him justice. It's absolutely delicious. Try it while they still have it.... you will not regret it.I hope to try them again. If I did have one thing I would change... iw ould have them list their prices on their menu. But I think that's it. They're really friendly here, and they're really energetic too, sometimes shouting and shaking their truck! Try this one! They're really cool!
4	Really great food. The truck goes everywhere during the week so it's easy to plan a sliders night. The only issue I've ever had is quality control. Some nights, when the people who own the truck are working, it's the best food money can buy. Others, when people just hired for expansion are working, I'd rather eat something else.Still, #windowlove
5	This is gourmet food on wheels! OMG every thing I've ever ordered is prepared right on site and to perfection! They are @ UNLV on Mondays so I know every Monday what I am having for lunch. I like the slider's because they are small and I don't get disgustingly full, just right and the sweet potato fries are superb! Love the pork slider, but I like to switch it up and I like the variety! Yum
3	Here's the thing - I don't like the bread. I like bread actually I love bread and when I'm enjoying my slider I need my bread to be soft & not too thick. The top part of the bread is just too thick. It almost remids me of how your bread tastes like when you open a bag of bread & don't seal it overnight. The next day it isn't soft and tastes a bit tough. Yeah, if the bread was soft/fresh I'd give more stars.While making a stop at the Slider Truck on my way home one Wednesday evening I did mention to the dude at the ordering window that I'm not feeling the bread. He asked why and I told him that the few times that I've gotten a slider the bread just wasn't soft and didn't taste fresh to me. In his exact words he smiled and said "NAWWWW" He did yell to the dudes making our sliders to make sure the bread is soft. The BF thinks because I complained about the bread that they most likely spit in our sliders- Gosh, I sure hope not.....Well, the bread was the same as all my other visits so I'm not sure whats going on. It seems like I'm the only one who has a problem with the bread so maybe I'm a freakin Alien!!!!!Anyhow,the inside of the slider is good. The Barby is our favorite- the Balsamic reduction really sets the Captain's order apart from the others-it has such a uniqe taste. The Pep Pep is our least favorite - taste wise it just doesn't compare to the other sliders. Our first time at the truck they gave us a bag to sample their fries,sweet potato fries and sweet potato tater tots. That was very nice of them and surprisingly my favorite was the sweet potato tater tots. I do think that the special sliders for $5.00 is too expensive. It's like people who don't eat meat have to pay extra for the caprese slider but isn't the cost of beef more than the cost of one little slice of eggplant?I'm mean when all is said and done they may say that they put more stuff in the special sliders but it's still between 2 tiny slider buns. The new Slider truck location looks like it's going to open up soon near my work fully equipped with a drive thru window that says "WINDOWLOVE". I'll go back and give them a try again but I just hope the bread improves.....** Wow, this is my first review with no pics- holy crap, I have been taken over by an Alien**
5	That's a tasty burger!
5	Great Sliders!  Will be back!
4	We tried the Porky, Caprese, Ya Ya, and Pep Pep with sweet potato fries. Location was awesome. They have a drive thru. Wait was a little long (20 min for 1st order, 10 min for 2nd) but thats cuz they hand press the patties as you order and they were packed. They have a smaller lobby so seating was limited. Food is good, bread could be better but all in all its a good place to eat.
3	Never tried the food truck, but with the opening of this location, my friends and I figured we'd give it the chance to impress. Being that these are sliders (i.e. not very large or filling), we tried a couple each. Now, I probably would've gone with more than that, but the prices here are bug-nutty bonkers. $3.00 average for one slider. It is more cost effective to eat at an actual restaurant, like Red Robin, which simply isn't reasonable for a drive thru. Now let me describe these things to you.The bun is a fitting size for a decent slider, but this becomes a problem when the ingredients inside don't even reach the edge. What comprises any one of these things are tasty, quality ingredients, but good luck experiencing them under all that bread. You can expect a golf ball sized gob of meat that isn't flattened much, with toppings sprinkled or stacked in a way that makes it more tall than wide. Often times, especially in the use of something like feta cheese, it all falls out the second it's moved or bumped. Yes, they are nice, but 20-30% more between the bread would've made a world of difference, and might actually let you taste something.So about a dollar a bite for something overpowered by the most plain ingredient. To back these up, we had the plain fries, as having them topped with sauces, cheese, bacon or even marshmallow results in a near doubling of the price. Absolutely nothing special, tasting about as bland as fries can possibly taste. To be nice, they had a pleasant crispiness to them and are quite heavy, so even more carb overload to quiet the protein deficiency the sliders may have left you with.The inside aesthetic is comic book heavy, with minimal seating and an absolutely ridiculous number of employees milling around each other like a small mob. I counted 13 in a space designed for about 7. And this place pushes stereotypical hipsterism as hard as it possibly can on everyone that goes near the place. I fully expect there to be boxes of Buddy Holly glasses just sitting around in the back room, because half the employees wear them as part of the uniform. Expect to be treated like some long-standing homie, with ironic undertones that we're all too cool to be in a fast food joint. It's as if management is pushing so hard for the place to be considered hip that it flies magnificently overboard into some kind of surreal joke. Sup bro? Sweet. Bump. That'll be twenty-eight bucks.
5	I never got around to trying the slider truck out but was excited to hear that they opened a permanent location in the Northwest side of town!My wife had brought one of each home from them last Friday and everything was great.  The sweet potato fries and some kind of fries with smores in it was pretty good.On Saturday, we went back again to correct something that went awry in our take out order the night before.  They were excellent.  This is what customer service is about!We tried their pep fries and DANG! I am hooked!  My favorites are the Barby, Pep Pep and Yaya!  The people that work there are awesome.  The place is new and clean.  In the bathroom, they have chalk so you can write on their black board walls. They have a Twitter dump on their wall and their ice machine makes the tiny / almost shaved ice kind of ice!  Good location right off Durango and 2-15, we'll be dropping by this store again for sure!Also, for those who are navigating your way out there, Google Maps is wrong - the store is on the NORTH EAST corner of Durango and Centennial in the same shopping center as 7-Eleven.
3	OK, Slidin' Thru gang - please don't take this the wrong way.  I love you guys.  I love the fun atmosphere of your truck and now your brick and mortar restaurant.  I love that your employees seem to enjoy their work which is awesome.  I also love that you have improved your french fries - they were great!But.....Your sliders weren't up to their normal awesomeness today.  I went in expecting to love it as much as I always loved the ones I got from your truck.  I dragged along a friend that "doesn't do food trucks" fully expecting her to be blown away by how good your stuff is.  And, well, lunch was just OK.  Aside from the yummy fries the two sliders weren't as special as usual.  I hate making that comment without constructive details, but I am not entirely sure what was different.  I ordered my two favorites - Porky and Barbie, and they were just Ok. I will be sure to check back in a few weeks and see if you have returned to your normally wonderful self, but I am not sure that friend of mine will be willing to make a repeat visit.Best of luck to you, please don't grow so fast you can't keep up the quality you started with.
2	The first issue I had was the fact they do not brew iced tea, but only offer tea from the fountain (lazy).  There were also two flavors of soda with signs they were "all swagged out" as well as a sign on the ranch dressing dispenser it had run out and to ask staff for ranch.  When I asked for ranch no one seemed to know where it was and there was a delay in finding me a small cup of ranchI am not sure if their cash register does not allow them to group sliders for each dinner or if the cashier just failed to enter our order properly, but we had to examine each slider in the baskets to figure out which slider belonged to which dinner.  The decor was unique and modern but was ruined by the constant yelling of the staff.  As for the sliders, the beef sliders were dry and overcooked and had a small, tall round portion of meat in the center which meant about half the bites of slider were not enjoyed with meat (there is a reason White Castle has thin square patties that cover the entire bun).  The meat on the porky was dry and seemed like the meat was a Sysco or similar frozen product and not prepared on sight from roast.
3	I first had Slidin' Thru this summer and it was a great experience.  A fist bump for everyone!  Plus a vegetarian friendly slider!  With my all-time favorite mozzarella!The slider was awesome and the balsamic reduction really sealed the deal for me.  The best part?  It was like 7 bucks for 3 sliders.  It was a steal!I've seen Slidin' Thru a couple times at other events (StrEATs, First Friday) but they've had a limited menu with nothing for my vegetarian belly.  I sadly had to walk by and dream of a Caprese slider for another day.I finally caught up with them again a couple weeks ago and noticed that their menu had giant stickers over the prices (or specifically, over the slider combo prices).  I thought maybe someone played a joke on them and stickered up their ride.  Well after paying $15 for 4 sliders, apparently the joke was on me.   I'm silently weeping right now as I write this.  Their Caprese sliders were great and I would love to hit them up every time I happen to see their truck.  But, this girl needs to be a little more picky with how she spends her money and sliders aren't exactly filling- so, Slidin' Thru is going to be more of a delicacy.  For food and overall experience, I would say 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  But with the new prices I'm going to have to bump them down for now.
4	I was very excited when Slidin Thru opened. I went to their Grand Opening but the line was too long and I was starving, so I decided to check it out the day after their grand opening. It was busy but not as busy as the day before. I ended up getting the Barby since I've had it before and I loved it. I also ordered their fried which had salt and pepper. The fries were not too salty, it was perfectly seasoned. The only thing about their sliders, it is a little pricey running from $3.00 to $3.50 per a slider. But I can say that the sliders are pretty filling. I love the artwork inside, it makes it different from other fast food places. The people were very friendly and apologized to the people that have been waiting a while for their food.
5	I dunno, but for some reason I'm so proud of Ric and his boys for making it to brick and mortar status.  I've been supporting these guys since the beginning, so it's nice to see that they've "made it."Stepping in this place, I felt like they had surpassed themselves in professionalism.  While keeping their Slidin Thru attitude of a fun environment to eat at, they slicked everything out with LCD monitors to show the menu and more comfortable seating than their old HQ location.The prices have changed a bit, slightly for the better for me.  I told Ric he should honor the old 3 for $7 pricing as a sort of "secret menu" like one competitor.Music was awesome in there.  Heard some Chromeo, some Hot Chip, some Tinie Tempah... can't ask for much more.I would say I'm bummed this place isn't closer to me, but it's probably a good thing as I would spend too much time and money at this place.  Once in awhile I'll make the drive up here.
4	I heart this place for many reasons, one of which is that it's close by (super cool places are few and far between way up here in the north).  Also, the restaurant has a bright, fun, colorful atmosphere that is very fitting for all the bright, fun, colorful employees serving up your dinner.  The menu is a little bigger than the truck's and there are still plenty of fist bumps to be had!I came here late on their opening night and it was still packed regardless of the fact that it was way past a reasonable dinner time.  Just goes to show you that everyone enjoys themselves a mini burg.  Although I'm sure the employees had been slammed all day, they were still as friendly as ever.  We ordered our caprese sliders and just stuck with the regular fries.  Maybe we'd try some of the new menu items at a later date.The caprese sliders were just as good as always- ever generous with the mozzarella and eggplant and ever extra yummy from the basil and balsamic reduction.  The fries may not be the best in the world, but they are certainly really good and recommended.Now, I was considering giving Slidin' Thru NW three stars like the food truck.  I think the price is a little high and it makes me sad.  But I am bumping it up to four stars.  Why?  Well, since I have a fun place to sit and enjoy my food, I think that deserves a little more love.  Secondly, I came back and had the barby fries.Imagine some of the greatest things in life - cheese, barbeque sauce, crispy fried onions.  Now imagine these things all piled on top of french fries and sprinkled with a little bit of jalapeno.  They may wreck your diet, but do you really need to lose those last two pounds?  I think not.This is definitely a fun little place to come hang out at.  Perfect for getting a snack or a full meal.  Perfect for a group of friends to hang out, or perfect for bringing your kids to get them their own lil' burg.  I still think the price is a little high on some items but fine if you don't stop by every single day.  Just be careful.  After you have the barby fries for yourself, you might start to consider making this place a part of your daily routine.
2	Before you get mad....... Slidin' Thru ACTUALLY gets a 2.5. I get it. They're nice guys, they fist bump you to make you feel special (even though you're not), they have a cool atmosphere with what some consider to be good music (I don't), and they serve (pretty) tasty sliders. I've caught the truck twice before in the past, and both times my stomach was still hungry and the pockets in my pants felt molested.I'm not going to whack around the bush; Slidin' Thru's prices are outrageous. If you are like me and thought that 3 sliders for $7 was a bit much on the truck, you're going to be totally disappointed now. Seven hundred and forty six dollars for a single mini-burg. Just kidding! But you can pay upward of $3.50 for one burger; and as of opening day, no 3 for $7. How cheap! And not the good kind of cheap either. In the end, I agree with the masses that Slidin' Thru has a lot of character and good eats. But unfortunately they also have steep prices and long wait times. Did I mention my slider buns weren't exactly fresh either? If I'm going to pay nearly four dollars for one tiny hamburger; it better give my mouth a boner! While it's good to see Slidin' Thru open a location so close to my house, I think I'll take my three million Carl's Jr. coupons (thanks, mailbox!) to Uncle Carl and gets me some full-sized charbroiled burgers in the future. Call me cheap : I work hard for my money! The menu is refreshing and the fist bumps are a nice touch; but it'll take more than that to get MY yen.* This review is for the Durango location.
2	Read about this place in the local paper so we thought we'd give it a try after sledding in Lee Canyon.  Its in a pretty easy corner off Durango which you can see when you've just past the hospital and the 215.  Looks like a good selection of burger options, but its our first time so we went for some Plain Jane's and a couple Porky burgers.  The Porkys are great.  The Plain Janes -- 2 stars,   After biting into one you say to yourself "How much did I pay for this #%@&?"   This place is EXPENSIVE for what you'd expect to be about a 35 cent burger.    I hope they can stick around long enough to come up with a Dollar Value Menu.  Tried the sweet potato hot tots.  Tastes more like cinnamon glue.  Brought some home for others to try and still the same reaction -- tasteless for sweet potato.  Next time I'm going to try the eggplant and the other choices.  Hopefully by then, they'll drop their prices on the plain stuf.
4	I am familiar with the original Slidin' Thru food truck as it was a common occurrence to visit when they made a stop near my office.  Now that they have a standing location in the NW near my home, I thought I would give it a try.  Yes, it is a little pricey for sliders.  In their defense, they do use some premium ingredients and the little sliders are more filling than you would expect.  The menu selection at the restaurant is an expanded version of the trucks original.  They have beef sliders, a pork slider, and even a couple of chicken sliders.  They have regular fries and sweet potato fries in plain or several other variants.  They have a soda fountain and sodas in old fashioned glass bottles.  It is all pretty much a standard burger stand.  It is both retro and modern at the same time.  The staff is great.  They have fun with their job and it shows in both their attitude and product.  I love them.  I give them four stars (truly 3.5) because the sandwiches I got in the restaurant were not as good as from the truck.  Less sauce on my porky.  Jalapenos that were more fresh than caramelized.  It also took a little long to get my food.  I like this place.  I really do.  I plan to visit again.  I just can't give them a perfect score yet.
1	I was very excited to see no line at the Slidin Thru truck last nite at First Friday. I went to the window and waited over five minutes just to have my order taken. I ordered two Porkys, I was told they were out of pulled pork, since my heart was set on the Porky, I let out an "Awww". I was completly shocked to hear the guy in the window rudely say "what do you expect? We've been out here for hours". Instead I ordered two sliders, a plain jane and a Barbie. Opted out of the fries I was gonna order, just because of his rudeness. Now, it pains me to say this because I was a HUGE fan of this truck. But- the sliders were just okay. Barely okay. First of all- I waited for 24 minutes to get my order (keep in mind, no line when ordering). The buns on both of my sandwiches were cold. The bottoms were toasted- but the bread was totally COLD. In addition to being cold, it was stale. My slider meat seemed smaller than normal. On the plain jane, it was all cold bread, cold ketchup. On the barbie, the meat was warm, and all other components were cold. Sadly after eating my sliders, a friend asked "ooh slidin thru- was it good?". I honestly answered "NO". Not in a big rush to line up and wait at the Slidin Thru truck anytime soon.
5	Love love love Slidin Thru! My favs are the Ya-Ya and Buffalo Solider. Regular fries are the best in town.
4	It is hard to not love this place. Ric and the crew are all very personable and the food is solid. The Barbie and Pulled Pork are permanently emblazoned in my mind. I have tried a few other items but nothing compares to these BBQ masterpieces. The caramelized jalapenos are the key to how much I love these sandwiches. It is either that or they are slipping crack into the BBQ sauce. One taste and I am hooked. My sister and I had split the Smore Fries once and I still cringe at the fact that we finished a whole order. For anyone who is trying Slidin' Thru for the first time, it is not for the faint of hearts. This decadent treat should probably not be tackled by one person. Tow people is still a stretch, but since this fatty could knock it out with help, it is not impossible. The food is reasonable and that is good because it is a far drive for me to get there. I cannot wait for the Fort Apache location to open up.
5	Q: What do you get when you take a bunch of crazy guys, delicious sliders, and a brick and mortar restaurant? A: The future of "Fast Food."I've been a follower of the Slidin' Thru guys for over a year and each time I eat the food and live the experience I am always amazed. That experience definitely translates to Slidin' Thru NW as they have managed to keep the food just as delicious while still staying true to their overly enthusiastic style. Throw in some dubstep/classic rock and this is somewhere I could see spending Friday night with some friends. Sad? Not a chance!
4	I've been following SlidinThru since the beginning, and the only thing I really wish they could work on is the price!! Really, I understand these are "gourmet" sliders, but its ridiculous. I spent 40$ on a small meal for the whole family, including their special fries and 2 drinks. The food, great as always. Service, great and funny as usual. Hopefully prices come down some day.
2	I really wanted to love this place, given all of the wonderful things I'd heard, but unfortunately it just seems to be another over-hyped novelty that doesn't stand up.  I've been twice and sampled as many burgers as possible to be sure it wasn't an off night, and haven't found anything to recommend.  Now, I've only been to their brick and mortar location, and have not sampled directly from the food truck itself, but it doesn't sound like there is any difference.  The wait is unreasonably long, nothing I have tried was piping hot and none of it tasted as if it were made fresh to order (other than assembling the burger and toppings).  I was also a little surprised by the prices.  They are quite high, but would have been worth it had the burgers been phenomenal.The bun to meat ratio is way off.  The top bun is way too thick (or the meat is way too thin).  I also agree with some of the other reviewers about the dryness/staleness of the bread.  Each time, I ended up picking off about half of the top bun because it was so thick and dry.  The toppings I have had are bland and get absorbed by the bread, and the meat itself has no taste.  McDonald's makes a more flavorful "special sauce".  The sauce on my burger had less flavor than plain mayo.  The only highlight of the meal were the bbq fries (with jalepenos, bbq sauce, onion strings, bacon).  Despite being shoestring fries, they were crispy enough to hold up under all of the toppings and were quite yummy!  Unfortunately, some decent fries aren't enough to bring me back again.  Overpriced, overhyped, and underwhelming.
5	My First Love.... in Food Trucks that is. I remember going to their truck stop during the summertime by Yogurtland and getting a coupon for a free cup off yogurt after you eat their sliders... Great, great marketing strategy ;) The energy they bring when ordering makes all the difference in the experience of their followers. I didn't even know what to expect coming from having a mentality that "Food Trucks" were dirty and the food was considered.. junk. I had an immediate change of heart from my first experience in trying this particular food truck. Fist pumps, the enthusiasm that makes you smile, and of course the sliders and sweet potato fries... I was literally blown the heck away.Now to the goods... These are my usual:The Barby: Love cheddar cheese.. it's melted on top of the thick mini patty with a piece of crisp bacon, tangy bbq sauce. On the bottom layer.. there are some caramelized jalapenos and crispy fried onion strips. The soft fluffy buns with all these elements of deliciousness. makes this my favorite slider...The Yaya: Reminds me of some greek food, but in a slider form. I'm not a huge fan of Feta Cheese, but in this combination.. it works. This slider was somewhat... refreshing to bite into. The fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and red wine vinaigrette made it like a healthy treat than anything else. Loved it.The Captain's Order: Another feta cheese version that I did like...  You can't go wrong with sauteed onion and crisp bacon in a slider.. I call this a Classy One. Included balsamic reduction, roma tomato, and arugula. Flavorful and nice bite from the balsamic reduction. The feta cheese in both sliders really give it a lot of character and color to each bite. Enjoyed this one very much.Sweet Potato Fries: Long thin rectangular shaped fries... Absolutely LOVE them. Occasionally I'll try something different... I did like the Pulled Pork. The meat was so tender!!! The spice from the bbq sauce and caramelized jalapenos brighten the whole taste and gave this slider a great kick!!! Ha Yaaaah on that! I did go adventurous one night and ordered their Mystery Slider... which was Da Irish Hash!!!  A WHOLE hash brown, egg, chedda peno, n bacon. As I was eating this slider, half the hash brown fell off and even eating that only was so darn good!! Crisp on the outside, tender in the inside... now that's a great piece of hash! This mystery slider made my night... it was so delicious and hearty. I so needed this from dancing like a maniac at work and let me tell you... I left Very happy!!! Now for dessert.. I did try their Sweet Potato Smores. They bring it out to you like a baked casserole. Melted marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and topped with crumbled graham crackers. Dig in and you'll find yourself lost in sweet ecstasy. So warm and so good. This really is soothing to the soul. Some think soup.. but if you're sick of soup.. think of this dessert! ;)  Service has always been exceptional here... Nick introduced me to Jarritos. Delicious lime flavor that goes well with sliders and fries.. Thanks Nick!!! My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she was confused at first on why I chose this spot to have a nice birthday dinner. She goes... you sure?!?! There's some nice places in the hotels you know? I told her.. I know, but you asked and this is where I want to go. So we met up here and she was just pleasantly surprised how good this place was. She told me... now I understand why you wanted to come here :D Damn right girl!!! There were times where the server? would attempt to skateboard with my food in his hands... I thought that was quite cute and amusing... until he dropped a few of my sweet potato fries!!! I was like Oh Noooooo!!! AHhhhhh!!! I almost... almost dived down to the ground to catch it in my mouth, but he ran all those fries over... such tragedy of sweet potato fries in my mouth world. One time they even came out dancing to serve our food.. So entertaining! I thought it was the cutest thing :D It's a treasure to have a place like this here in Vegas... One of my loves for life.
5	I'm use to the Slidin Thru food truck and I love them.  I been to the Slidin Thru HQ and found it kind of small, but still love them.  Now Slidin Thru NW, got to say its a bit of a change on pricing, but WAY better than HQ and still love them.  Reading some of these other reviews and trying to compare the food truck pricing to the restaurant.  I'm sure some of these people can take the time to understand, running a food truck vs running a restaurant is two different things.  I understand that they offer certain amount of sliders for a certain price.  But trying to maintain a restaurant, you have to put the price somewhere, to keep the business open.  Maintaining a food truck is probably easier, than maintaining a restaurant.  So I understand where the pricing in the restaurant is a bit more than the food truck pricing. Plus you got limit amount of items, unlike other restaurant that has a few dozen items.   Either way, I respect Slidin Thru.Other than pointing out the difference and seeing where they have to make those changes, for them to run the restaurant. I still give Slidin Thru much love and respect.  Coming from a Food Truck to a decent size restaurant, and still maintain the food truck, is a big accomplishment.   I applaud them for that.  Slidin Thru is located on the corner of Durango and Centennial, right behind 7-11,  It's bright, and very creative and of course you always get that warm feeling.  Either from the color scheme or the energetic staff.  They will make you feel that you matter.  I've been here a few times, and always order the Pep Pep and Barby Fries, which I believe is amazing.  I just love the mixture of flavor they put on the Barby Fries.  I always wanted to try the sweet potato smore's, but with the Pep Pep and Barby fries, they tend to be my favorite.  I like the fact that they have a drive Thru, where you can order and go.  I do like going inside to order, just to feel that energetic atmosphere.  That right there, shows that these people have some kind of spunk and love what they do.  If you love the food truck of Slidin Thru, you'll love the restaurant.  I'll admit that the pricing may differ from the food truck, but remember, maintaining a food truck differs from maintaining a restaurant.  You still get the same great taste and the same great energy from the staff.  But at the restaurant, you have that luxury of driving thru or dining inside in a nice and unique atmosphere.
5	If you were a fan of the original Slidin' Thru Slider truck, then there is no doubt in my mind that you'll love this.Pretty much it takes everything that is awesome from the truck (quality, atmosphere, fun, value) while getting rid of the things that often annoyed me (30-40 minute waits, d-bags cutting in line, no real place to sit down and eat).I will always and forever be in love with the porkie, it is one of the cheapest sliders on the menu and for few bucks you can get the combo pack.  I love their god tier fries, I really can't find a way to nitpick.  The only gripe I could see from other people would be that the location is kind of way NW Vegas, but since I live close to the area, I am fine with the location.  You'll definitely will see me here in the future.#WindowLove#SlidinThruMyHeart#HappyPanda
4	Hubby and I successfully climbed a mountain today and, as usual after a successful ascent, I was hungry.  Tummy was rumbling and grumbling like a disgruntled bear.  I've been wanting to try Slidin' Thru NW for a while and today was it.  Nothing like a good long hike to give one an excuse to eat really bad food.........and the food was bad in that great wonderful junk food way, except the quality of the ingredients was very high!  I ordered one Plain Jane sans cheese (regular angus beef slider) and one Porky (bbq pulled pork) and hubby ordered one Pep Pep (BLT + cheese) and one Caprese (as in the salad).  We shared an order of the sweet potato fries.Great flavour and food quality.  The Porky bbq sauce is SO GOOD.  What do they put in it??  Hubby's Caprese slider was delish as well, featuring a nice blend of the balsamic vinegar with the mozza.  Some may feel the prices to be on the high side for baby burgers, but I'm ok with paying a bit more for quality.  (And, the sliders aren't baby sized.  Two plus a side of fries is a decent meal.)  Prices range from $2.50-$3.50 for sliders and $2 for regular fries to $3 for the sweet potato fries.NB: The sweet potato fries are sweet!  Instead of salt, the folks at Slidin' Thru sprinkle a cinnamon-sugar-y mix over the fries.  I prefer my fries salty, so will not order the sweet potato fries again; that said, the fries were crispy and hot!NB#2: Is there a way to avoid the use of styrofoam?  I know that the sliders can get messy and hot sliders are the goal, especially for the drive thru customers, but styrofoam?  Really?The place was super clean when we went earlier today and the staff very enthusiastic about our first-time visit.  :)
5	I love a good fist bump before dinner! I wasn't prepared to yell,"There is no salt in my pants" before I ordered though. It was worth my embarrassment because I earned a discount!  If you want to say silly things and earn rewards like Slidin Thru on facebook and they will keep you posted.I had the Barby and Plain Jane slider. The Barby had caramelized jalapenos, melted cheddar,crispy fried onion strips, bacon and BBQ sauce. It was packed with sweet, spicy flavor. The Plain Jane may only have had cheese and ketchup but it was still very tasty! Jon and I also shared the Barby Fries which has the same ingredients as the burger minus the meat. We ended the meal with dessert. We thought that there was a Smore Sundae but they actually put them on their sweet potato fries. The guy behind the counter was nice enough to make us a make shift sundae. We had vanilla ice cream with Graham Cracker sprinkles and it was all topped with chocolate sauce. It's nice to know that they like to go the extra mile for customer service because there are so many places that slack in this area.
1	I have never had a worse burger! Bread was stale messed up my order 2x! I will not be returning! I can just imagine when they hold Vegas StrEATs, how bad there service is.
4	I came to Slidin' Thru for one purpose: knock it out of the way so it's one less food truck to hit at the next strEATs event. I had heard mixed reviews but had no clue what to expect.When I walked in I felt like I stepped into the pages of an old school comic book. The menu isn't much but is everything you need. When we stepped up to order, I was immediately gestured for a fist bump.. I felt like the new girl who was accepted with open arms by the nerds in high school. I love nerds! The barby was so yummy and I was feeling adventurous so I asked for the mystery sandwich. When the food came I quickly realized the mystery was the famed Porky Tacos (an off menu secret item). Already sampling off menu items on my first day? This definitely made me smile. The tacos were delicious and although spicy, it was just the kick they needed.For desert we tried the Smores.. sweet potato fries topped with ice cream, hot fudge, and melted marshmallows. It was a little slice of heaven. The best part of the Slidin' Thru experience is that it's right down the street and I can relive it anytime. No long lines at a food truck :)
1	Really disappointing!  My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 40% on my reason for coming to this festival was to finally try Slidin' Thru.  First off, the line was really, really long.  I hate waiting in lines.  But, I'll admit its a fairly reliable sign of good food.  After about 15 minutes of waiting in line the person in front of us stated that Slidin' Thru was out of everything but the Plane Jane.  Thanks a lot Slidin' Thru for not telling us sooner.  At this point we were committed, even if I could only try the Plane Jane.  As we got near the ordering booth I noticed a group of girls lingering around the ordering booth.  They were typical high school girls: over concerned with their looks and not particularly friendly.  Perhaps, Slidin' Thru groupies as Slidin' Thru has earned their street credit as a cool place.  Then, it was my turn to order (around 30 minutes of waiting already).  The man was slow to take my order.  I'm sure he was tired because I know they were super busy, but the food festival had been going for only three hours (it was 8 pm and the thing went from 5 pm to 9 pm).  The truck was nicely decorated and hip-hop played on the radio inside.  We ordered two Plane Janes and one Caprese, they were out of everything else.  Then we began our wait for the order to be cooked.  One of the groupies picked up an megaphone and said "Hey, people of the truck.  We are out of everything but the Plane Jane."  Okay, so at least one works for the truck.  They were not all just groupies.  And, why hang out right at the ordering station?  The area was really crowded already.  It did not need 6 or 7 more people lingering.  Especially with their attitude.  Also, why not give the public service announcement every 5 or 10 minutes?  Why wait so long?  People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that.  Our food finally came out.  Total time, about an hour.  The meat was under cooked.  It was pink in the middle and cold.  the buns were dried out and crusty.  The Caprese fell apart as we tried to eat it.  The food was not special.  I prefer In and Out Burger, and I always know where they are at.  The man working the counter apologized and began handing out cards for a free slider at their fixed Northwest location.  It was a nice gesture, but the food was not good.  I overheard him explaining to another customer that one of their storefront locations had recently closed because it could not make enough money.  I understand why.  I think this place probably makes descent sliders on most days and the whole food truck craze and their cool vibe has served them well.  However, they have become a victim of their own success.  Rarely do things meet over inflated expectations.  I'll give this place another try aside from a food truck festival, but for this experience, what a dud!
4	Ok, I needed to update.  Saw Slidin' Thru outside of Insert Coins tonight and they made me barby fries even though they don't normally serve that on the trucks (only the restaurant).  Love every employee I've ever met with Slidin' Thru!
1	According to their web site, they were going to be at Sam Boyd Stadium today 11am-5pm. I walked 10 minutes from my house to Sam Boyd and got there around 3pm. I looked all around the parking lot and especially closely at the food vendor area. They weren't there.1 star for not being able to find them at their scheduled time and place. I'll retract this if somebody corrects me and lets me know that they really were there but were at some not-so-obvious location. Otherwise, how can I trust that they'll be where they say they'll be the next time?
4	I've been a fan of Rics little dream before many knew of the truck. I do like the idea of not having to chase around a truck and just go down the street. The staff is trained to be just as nice as Ric is and they talk the same as Ric and greet with fist bumps. The menu has at a few expansions and changes. They done away with the 1-$3, 2-$5, 3- $7 and now it is individually priced from $2.50- $3.50 per slider.   Feel free to ask for a substitute of eggplant or chicken into the slider flavors. And you can upgrade to combos with any sliders. The Barby is still my favorite burger slider- the sauce the jalapeno and the onion crisps get me every time. I do like the Chicky Boom that is on the menu now and my usual is the caprese or sub eggplant into the yaya.A little note, I noticed they use plain type buns now but way back when it was more like a sweet bun and I prefer the texture of those which I thought gave it more of a "gourmet" slider feel as it should. Fries wise, I either go plain or I like the barby superfries when I'm feeling extra junkfoody.  I see shakes are a new addition and I have not tried them out yet. Overall, a welcome addition to my neighborhood and glad to see a local business doing well.
1	Tried them out at the Southpoint food truck festival a couple weeks ago after I saw very high marks here on Yelp.Sucked.How can you report to a food festival with EXTREMELY stale buns???  The old, cold, crumbly bread made everything else taste like crap.  What was worse is I waited in line for it.Not going back.
5	This review is a bit late, but better late then never, life's events takes it's toll...So, This is my second time coming here. I wish they were closer to my home, 40 + mile round trip. I really like the vibe and the quirky things that makes this place unique. It really sets this place apart from "just another burger joint". I had the Barby,  Captains order and dessert. Good Burgers and dessert, I am a happy camper  The place got filled up fast once we got there, just play off as they are our entourage. At first they were a bit hesitate to give us the dessert because I guess they only had enough for a few more smores. The let us have it anyways. Next visit will be harder because I tried almost everything; then again any of the burgers will do the trick.
4	3.5 overall rounded to 4 for being somewhat unique and great service.I was excited to try this place, so much so that I skipped lunch yesterday and spent an extra 20 min on the treadmill to build up maximum hunger before going (not healthy, i know) for my 1st time :)The location is sadly far from me but worth a trip 1x at least.With maximum hunger I ordered the plain jane mini meal, the buffalo soldier and the caprese.  The guy asked is that all?...and i just laughed at him and he laughed back at me lol.Plain Jane - Nothing special but solid little burger.  If not for the very generous serving of fries i'd feel ripped off by the price of the combo   3/5Buffalo Soldier - My first bite was like all bun and ranch...yuck.  I had to kind of hunt for the ingredients and break it down.  The hot sauce and swiss were almost non existent and the chicken was this tiny little piece of flavorless meat.  The crispy onions were good and a nice touch.  Wouldn't repeat this one or would try it light ranch and more hot sauce?   2/5Caprese-  Saved this for last....A friend of mine says you can really taste food with your eyes, and she's right!  It was clear this was going to be the best slider as you could see the fresh eggplant and cheese, tomato bulging outside of the bun.  It was like the Buffalo Soldier and the Caprese came from different slider joints.  Very tasty and the most balanced of the 3 I tried.   5/5Fries - Regular fries with the combo were really good and generous portion.  4/5Overall comments1.  Price..all this food was $11, which seemed steep but I was ridiculously full after so I guess it's highish but not ridiculous.  I think people would warm up to the price if the value meals came with 2 sliders and less fries perhaps?  The plain jane was pretty tiny and the ala carte price of $2.5 seems LOL   3/52.  The buns....weren't bad, weren't great....but seemed uninspired and seemed to dominate the sliders with the exception of the Caprese.  I felt myself wanting to ditch the bun by the time I got to this one.  Maybe they could reduce the size of the buns?   2/53.  Awesome service.  I know they fist bump everyone and say hi and bye enthusiastically to everyone but if that was the norm in this little world wouldn't we all be happier :)   The staff seemed genuine and like they enjoyed working there  5/5Overall the experience left me wanting to try more...i'll be back after another long workout!!!
2	I have been a faithful fan of Slidin Thru ever since my co workers introduced me to them about two years ago. I always tried to pay a visit to their truck whenever they stopped near my workplace or home.For the past 6-7 months, I noticed their truck don't make rounds to various area of Vegas like they used to, especially since they opened a restaurant in northwest and with a new one coming in southwest. I thought it's probably because their cooks now work in the restaurants.Fast forward to recently, I finally got a chance to try various sliders that they make a few days ago and were surprisingly disappointed. Their juicy delicious sliders are now replaced by their stale buns and dried patty. Their customer service kinda lost the friendliness that I used to see from them. Anyway, I thought I was just being judgmental and sensitive, but base on some recent unhappy reviews from my fellow yelpers, I guess I wasn't being oversensitive or over negative.I hope Slidin Thru reads reviews from here and realize that they shouldn't ignore or abandon the fan base that used to drive out of the way to eat their sliders and supported their business.
2	I've been to this place just once.  I went on a Friday night soon after this location opened, and they seemed to be having trouble.  I got home to find that my order was wrong, so I drove the 10-15 minutes back to get it corrected.  They still got it wrong, but on the third try, it was right.  I had one slider that was called a Captain-something.  It was OK, not great.  They were nice about correcting the problem, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.
5	This place looks like In-N-Out with a splash of Cool.I usually don't drive out to the NW side of LV but Slidin Thru makes it worth it. I always get the barby, yaya, captain's order with a mexican coke.$10 fills you up & don't be fooled by "Mini Burgers" they are a good size. BURGER FANS MUST TRY SLIDIN THRU NW!!
4	This truck is always at UNLV, which is convenient for me. I come here for their Caprese sliders. Delish. It goes a little like this: Bun, mozzarella, balsamic, basil, tomato, eggplant, heel. The only thing that I don't enjoy is that the fries are a hit or miss. Sometimes they're good, sometimes it's obvious they've been sitting there for a bit. I forgive them though because their customer service is great. They are always happy and very chill. Their concept is very hipster though. Which has good and bad connotations in my book.
2	I've eaten off their truck before and liked it, so we we're excited to finally make our way to the restaurant.Upon entering we were greeted. The staff was nice enough and helpful but that was about the only good thing about our experience. I didn't care for the loud horrible music playing in the dining room. Waiting for our order we picked a table, all of them were dirty, there were 2 other tables with customers. They locked the front doors while we cleaned our own table. We thought that was weird. It was cold in there so I asked my hubby to grab my jacket out of the car, when he came back he said there was a car parked blocking their drive thru and wondered if they were closing. It was only 3:30, I had checked earlier to make sure they were open today before we made the drive over from the SW, and the hours said open Sundays til 9pm???We got our food in good time, we got the Pep Pep, Barby, Captains Order, Plain Jane, Mystery Slider, and Pep Fries. So the mystery slider felt like they just threw a bunch of random stuff on a bun, chicken, mozzarella, pineapple, crispy fried onion strings, and some sort of hot sauce...it was tasteless. All of the sliders were dry and tasteless...the buns were stale, dry and crumbly. The fries were about the best thing which doesn't say much, you can tell they are frozen. This was one of the worst food experiences I've had in a while. BTW they placed a sign up in their window saying they closed at 3:30 pm to spend time with family, while we ate. We told Nick (name from receipt), our host, that we didn't like the food, it was dry. He was surprised, wanted to know if we wanted something else. Doug chocked down all the food cause he was hungry, and I wasn't about to eat more bad food, so we said no.Outside as we were leaving, 3 cars had to turn around out of the drive thru because they had closed early. Maybe Slidin Thru made enough money last night at Vegas Streats that they don't need to worry about it.I'll try the truck again but I won't waste my time and money at the NW location.
1	Just went to Slidin" Thru and I was not impressed. I had the Plain Jane and the Pep pep fries.  They are overpriced for the quality of the food. The fries looked microwaved and the burger was nothing special. I could of gotten the same thing at any burger joint and it would of tasted better. I also had a milk shake and the shake had ice crystals or something in it and to top it off the cashier took the remainder of the shake that was left over. I paid $4 bucks for that shake and he should of given the left over that didn't fit into the cup to me but he didn't. He acted like he was going to throw it out but began drinking it. These guys seem like a bunch of stoners out of Fast Times at Ridgemont  High. I was waiting for Spicolli to come out.
4	When I first walked in I felt like I was transported to some future fast food restaurant.   Where quality ruled & quantity is based on the customers desire.I ordered 2 different sliders to see if they were good overall.   Mmmm, sure was.  The BBQ pulled pork was tender & very tasty w/ caramelized jalapenos.  Other was their Pep pep, a Bacon cheese Burger w/ the fixings!  When I finished these 2, I was extremely satisfied & realized I didn't need the fries I had ordered. Overall was a great first experience.   Thank you guys...
1	I had high hopes for Slidin Thru as my first Vegas food truck. It sucked. Simple as that. Yelp has guided me to some great places to eat over the years. Sadly, this is one time it failed. Regretfully, 1 star is all Slidin Thru will get from me.
5	This place was parked in front of my building one evening, so I had to give it a try. First off, the truck itself is super bad ass, and it gave my boyfriend a comic boner just from looking at it. We both got a single slider (we had dinner just a couple of hours earlier, but knew we had to hop on our chance to try this place out). I got the Barby, which is pretty much like a mini bacon cheeseburger. It was pretty tasty. My boyfriend got the pep pep which he said was the best slider he's had in his life. We shared a large bag of sweet potato fries. I was surprised to see they coated them in brown sugar, which was yummy! We only had to wait about 5 minutes for what seemed as super fresh food. Hopefully I find this truck again!
3	I guess the food is alright I just think it is way over priced for what you get.
2	I'm really disappointed in the sliders from Slidin' Thru.   I was happy to see that they offered a non-meat option so we tried the Caprese sliders.  Between the 2 of us, we couldn't eat 3 of them because they were so bad.  The buns were dry, old and stale.  The portion of ingredients didn't work well because the balsamic vinegar/reduction was too over powering for the cheese and tomato.  The first bite was met with the stiff bun, the cheese was not creamy, the vinegar taste punched you in the mouth and it lacked seasoning.  I'm sad to write this review because I had high hopes for this restaurant.  I've read so many postive things about the Slidin' Thru food truck and was really excited to see their success and expansion into a building. I want to support local businesses so I'm not dismissing this place yet.  I'll just wait awhile before I try it again to see if they have heard their customers and are making any changes.
4	Ah, if only I had known you sooner...Finally managed an encounter with these guys when they showed up at Ethel M for a Saturday afternoon event. Redeemed my $5-for-$10 LivingSocial deal with no hassle (bought back on Jan 12... yep, it's been a little bit of wait). Placed my order, waited not too long, and brought it home because I didn't feel like sitting around.On the way home, I tried the sweet potato fries. They're dusted with sugar and (obviously) pretty sweet. I probably would've rather had normal fries if I had known how sweet it was, but to their credit, they did a great job on these.Upon reaching home, I popped open my styrofoam slider box. My first slider was the Pulled Porky. Holy. Crap. This is absolutely the best pulled pork and BBQ Sauce that I've ever had (sorry, Ben's BBQ). The pork was so tender and juicy, and the sauce was perfect. I didn't even remember that it had jalapeno because I didn't taste anything spicy, so don't let it scare you off. It's one of the less expensive options and definitely the yummiest.Next up: Pep Pep. Pretty good. Flavor profile isn't anything groundbreaking. It seemed like the meat on my slider was a little smaller than the mini-patty on my remaining slider. I decided to pop some sweet potato fries for this guy, and they actually made it a little more interesting.Final slider was the Captain's Order. This was really yummy, and it was mostly due to the balsamic reduction. Not too sour or sweet and brings something different to the table. I didn't notice the feta cheese too much but it probably helped. Don't eat sweet potato fries with this slider or you'll regret it.Overall, it's not perfect,  and I still remember my empty stomach from my first attempt to find them, but these guys are a good thing. I hope that they'll grace the streets of Henderson more often, but I'm sure I'll revisit them soon anyway and chow down on some Pulled Porkies.
4	I drove by on their grand opening and saw the long line of cars and I've seen their lunchwagon around town- I decided to wait till things calmed down alittle.  Slidin'Thru, the drive-thru--at first checking out the menu, you almost need a translator to decipher what each sandwich is all about, but if you have questions, when you order from the live person at the window--they will explain it all.  Yes, the music is a little loud on the inside, but the staff is friendly and the slider's are tasty.  I loved the sweet potato fries and the simple but tasty Plain Jane.  I can't recall the name of the Chix slider with the battered onions, bacon, hot sauce and other dressings-but that is a go to.  Be prepared to bust out the cash, because it ain't cheap--one slider is not enough!  Hours could be extended though, open till 10 on weekdays, and 11 on weekends--would be great for a midnight snack or hang-out, if they went till at least 1am on weekends.
3	The Slidin' Thru food truck plus 5 others were set up in the parking lot at the soon to open new restaurant on Fort Apache.  These food trucks were primarily serving BBQ dishes, but we had a discounted gift certificate so we ordered (2) Caprese (vegetarian) sliders plus (1) Pep Pep (Angus beef) slider. The ingredients were excellent, but the rolls were a little too large and not as fresh as once would expect.  A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate.
4	Finally! Slidin' Thru was here on the UNLV campus today. I love when they're on campus because they are always conveniently located right outside of my job. It's awesome really. I have only had one other experience with Slidin Thru other than today's and I would have to say both were pretty good! The line is usually a little long since most students stop by the truck for lunch or in between passing periods, so keep that in mind if you're planning on trying it out one day.Today I decided to have two Barbys. The Barby is a slider with melted cheddar cheese, fried onion strips, bacon, barbecue sauce, and caramelized jalapenos. In other words, amazingness in a bun. My order came out fairly quickly and was as delicious as I remembered it from the first time. This is definitely a favorite of mine and always will be.Besides their slider options, they have regular and sweet potato fries. They give you a brown paper bag full of fries, so trust me you will get full! This is definitely a food truck you want to try if you're tired of the usual options in the SU or even the Dining Commons on campus.
4	Ok I am going to let you on a little secret.  According to Google maps this place from my front door is 31.1 miles and approximately takes 37 minutes to get there.  Why on earth would I driver 37 minutes to get a slider?  Well, my little secret is that I can't ever seem to make it to the truck at night and when I go to the food truck things in parking lots there are too many decisions and this one is always jam packed.  So this is what we did one Sunday afternoon.  We packed up the fam and made the trek to try the famous Slidin' HQ.  We got there and after refueling a few times, bathroom breaks, took some landmark pics....  Just kidding, but it did feel like a road trip.  We were greeted and decided on what we were going to get.  We ordered a couple plain Jane's (One for my daughter) Captain's order, Pep pep, and a Caprese.  The bread was a little stale but that was it.  They were tasty.  So the food was ok but the service was incredible.  The guy who took the order was really nice.  Now when I go to food truck festivals I can cross this off my list and not have to wait 2 hours like you do at these things for finger food.  If you live in the area or ever in the area, go check it out!  They used to have a location by the airport, I hope they can put one in the south someday again.  Cheers!
5	Been a few times and things have improved which is a good sign that they're are getting into the groove here. Last few visits was particularly good. Ric was indeed in the house one of the times, but the last time he wasn't and it was still a good standard. My thing the first visit was the bun broke too easily and it seems now they are toasted  so that it holds up better. I haven't had the sweet potato s'mores since way back when at HQ and one day while Ric was there he gave us some dessert before dinner and it was improved because there's ice cream in it and whole marshmallows. First time I was actually able to eat more than a few bites. Fries was way better than before. It was crispy and seasoned just right. I didn't remember it being seasoned before at HQ and the truck. I would say maybe give it a try now that they've ironed out some details.
4	Gourmet street fare or otherwise known as meals from a truck is nothing new to me. Since living as a New Yorker, it is pretty common sight to see food vendors on the street with their mini food carts or otherwise, food trucks. It's sort of fast food-on-the-go. To me, that's quickie meal. See, eat, and done! Serves the purpose of hunger filling! Golly, it has found its way even in other major American cities and now in Vegas! Okay, so Sliding Thru as this food truck is aptly named, has gained popularity. This one is crewed by five friends in their twentysomethings. I tried their fare in October 2010. There was a line of customers as I approached the truck. I ordered sliders affordably priced and I was able to see up-close inside their truck how these jolly, fun, easy-going food crew whips up these delicious favorites of mine: sliders. In the truck, it's a mini kitchen with the usual things of the sink, freezer, stainless steel compartments, storage spaces underneath the sink, overhead storage, paper supplies, first aid kit, plastic counter for preparing the food, ice bath compartment, steam table, flat grill with a grease trap drain and faucet for cleaning the grill, deep-fat fryer, fire extinguisher, a grill hood with fan, serving station, station for hot beverage containers, the window where food is served to customers, rubber mats on the floor, a counter with lids to store candies and chips, then the door in the area of the truck driver's section. Well, that's much I saw because it smelled food goodness inside the truck! Yes, a restaurant on wheels!In no time at all, I got my sliders sssllliiiid thrruuu the truck's side window! See photos of "Pulled Porkie" (a Southern style barbecue pork in that sweet and sour spiced jalapeno barbecue sauce with lotsa grilled caramelized onions), the "Eggplant Caprese" (with great chunks of tomato, eggplant) and a "Mystery Slider" (which is a daily special. The special I got was a burger-bacon-cheese yummminess), they were absolutely the bombilicious!!! Moist, warm, juicy and tasty. Add to that, it is freshly made! Packed in styrofoam box, it had M & M's and a Milky Way chocolate treats for dessert, plus a small pack of wet naps for the messy part of the food adventure. Oh, the crunchy sweet potato fries are my favorite as well as the "Pep Pep" and "Captain's Order". Mind you, it didn't take much minutes to devour them (I wasn't even hungry) but is a testament to how good it is that my heart fell in love all the way to my stomach. I even got to take their picture as they happily, giddily, comically posed for me. These men start work very early in the day, then prepares food for freshness, cooking, serving, and maintaining cleanliness after a day's work, with long hours but they like it! Steven, Juan, Louie, Nick and Ric (Ricardo Guerrero, owner), it's grrrreaaaat, boys!!Website: www.slidinthru.com
5	There is nothing about Slidin' Thru that I dislike (except maybe the occasional long line).  The truck is very eye catching, and the guys working the truck are all super laid back, friendly, and excited about their food, which really turns a meal at Slidin' Thru into a genuine experience.  The sliders here are nothing less than gourmet, and I've yet to try one I dislike even in the slightest.  My favorites are definitely the Pep pep and the pulled porky, with the barby coming in a close third.  One of the great things about this truck is that you order by the slider and can easily mix and match, so if you want to try 3 different sliders, go for it.The prices here are reasonable, but might be a bit surprising the first time you stop by the truck - but remember, there are gourmet sliders, and the quality and service are well worth the few extra bucks.
4	Their truck had a long line at the Las Vegas Foodie Festival. Since they were bookmarked as a place I wanted to try, I got in line. Definitely had to wait a while to order and to get my burger. I asked them to pick what I should try, being my first time. They picked the Barby, and since I was going to try other trucks, I just ordered one. I have to say, it was pretty darn good. I could've definitely eaten another one.They have an actual store...right? I'll be there soon.
5	Can't believe I've waited this long to visit since it's so close to my abode, but this place is going to be seeing alot of me! From the fist-bump at the drive thru window to the amazingly fresh slider and fries I ate, everything was a perfect 10. I got a porky slider with sweet potato fries and a soda. The porky slider was always sold out when I caught up with the slider truck so I had to try it out. The meat was so moist and smoky while the jalapeno relish added a spicy bite. The fries were crispy, fresh and plentiful. It was a great fast food experience altogether and I can't wait to go back and try more things.
3	The burgers are good here, but they are pricey.  $3 for one slider? I can get a regular sized and decent tasting burger or chicken sandwich for the same price, or a big burger for a little more elsewhere. I do like the mystery slider, and the fries are good.  I just can't get over the price... A family of 4 cannot get out of here for much less than $30 and may still be hungry when they leave.
5	When thinking about what business deserved my 100th review, the more I thought the more it made sense for the first real food truck I ever ate at to get the honors.This is the food truck to rule all food trucks! These guys seriously need their own tv show, because eating here is not only about the food, it's about the window love and the entertainment!My first time eating here it was something like an hour wait. The whole time I was just saying "Man this better be worth it or I'll be pissed!". Well I've been back at least 20 times since that first experience, so it's safe to say it was worth it. Anytime I have a friend from out of town come in for a visit, Slidin' Thru is one of the things I make them try. And not a one has been let down.So many good sliders...personal favorites are the Porky, Captain's Order, and the Barby. The sweet potato fries are some of the tastiest you'll ever find. And they're always offering a mystery slider that is a combo of deliciousness between two mini buns.So do yourself a favor and take the four-wheels of tasty adventure, fist pump at the ordering window, and tip the truck to hear the always awesome "Good lookin' out!".
5	Yet another area search on yelp! lead me to this spot in my new neighborhood. Walked in and said it was my first time there....got a huge greeting from the staff. They offered suggestions from the menu. When I said I didn't eat anything spicy, they offered to customize sliders. The sweet potato s'mores are a must!!! I was really impressed with the decor, menu and great service. Can't wait to go back!!!
5	It's been almost 2 years since my last Slidin Thru review. I've been back in Vegas for over 2 months and have been to the truck 4 or 5 times already. I swear I'm not a stalker.............. just in love with Porkies. I find myself day-dreaming about Porkies at work sometimes. The crazy thing is, they taste better and better every time and I don't know if that is my mind playing tricks on me or if they really do just taste better.I finally tried the Porky Taco at Vegas StrEATS this weekend. oh yeah... A-MAZ-ING!! No offense to the other vendors at StrEATS but... you can't beat Slidin Thru. Nothing I tried from the 4 or 5 other vendors came close to as awesome and delicious.Best Staff + Best Food + Most Awesome Looking Truck = SUCCESS**** NOTE TO OTHERS: GET ON THEIR LEVEL **** haha
5	Great Food, Fantastic Atmosphere, Future BoundThis place has it all, inviting ambiance, friendly staff and a creative menu.  I'll start off with the food since that's the heartbeat of all restaurants.  My personal favorite is the Captain's Burger, a juicy slider (they call them mini burgers) seasoned to perfection with balsamic reduction, feta cheese, arugala, tomatos, and carmelized onions.  (I'm getting the craving just typing about it).  This is set off by a delicious wheat bun....mmmmm!  The Pep Pep and the Buffalo Soldier are good as well, but its hard to pass up my fav.  Also try the Sweet Potato fries, a unique and tasty twist to typical fast food.  The atmosphere is fun and filled with energy, music is pumping, colors are vibrant and the staff is courteous.  Its a haul for me so I usually catch them at First Friday in their Food Truck
2	Got the Plain Jane and the sweet potato fries on my way to the Dodge dealership. The drive thru took FOREVER and I felt that it was way overpriced.The food was okay, but I've definitely had better. They need to work on their pricing-seriously $2.50-$4.00 PER slider? I think not
4	Been here twice and it has been good both times. First time my husband ordered 2 fries and it was way too much food with 2 sliders. Today we ordered and paid for 1 fry but they gave us 2 anyway.Burgers are really good but it's kind of expensive. It's about $20 for 2 people to eat here with 2 burgers each, 2 drinks and 1 order of fries.
4	I haven't had a single thing from the stand alone store that I haven't liked, but they have forgotten our sweet potato fries at the drive through two different times. The last time I stopped in I was walking out of the door when they ran the fries to me. If it weren't for this, I would give their food 5 stars. The menu is creative, the flavors are well-balanced and the food is reasonably priced considering the quality and ingredients. My favorites are the Captain's Table slide which has arugula and a balsamic reduction (nom!) and the porky because I am a sucker for pulled pork anything!Whether you stop at the truck around town or in one of the store fronts, Slidin' Thru has great food, just make sure you get everything you order!
3	Ya know, I love the burgers and the sweet tater fries. I think it's cool that Slidin Thru is such a unique part of Las Vegas and keeps the locals involved in the action.I just can't seem to find the truck anymore, what's the deal?
3	burgers were good. we had the pep pep, porky, caprese, some other chicken one i can't remember the name of, regular fries and sweet potato s'mores. the sliders are fun to eat- a novelty, but the actual beef burger itself didn't impress us that much. take into consideration that it can get pretty pricey. one last thing, the drive-thru did take forever like others have mentioned.
5	Everything that I have ordered from this place has been awesome. Before you consider going to some fast food chain like the BK Lounge or Micky D's do yourself a favor and go here. 1 or 2 sliders and that's all I need to hit the spot. This is the type of place I want to see do well because the people here take care of their customers. Great job!
4	I love this place bc of the owners (Ric) enthusiasm and the quality of food.  However, the last few times I've been there the service seemed rushed and therefore the quality slightly lacked.  I'm almost certain the drive thru attendant did not wash his hands before he handled our food, which is a huge no-no for me, but I can't be sure.  I want this place to do good and I love their food, but they seem to be slacking due to their success and popularity.
5	The good guys strike again!Food: amazing as alwaysStaff: friendly and welcomingLocation: bit far away for me but it's right down the street from Retro Bakery which allows me to kill two birds with one stoneDecor: not as cool as HQ was, definitely more "fast food drive thru" like.. but that's what they were going forWhat else can I say about Slidin Thru??Oh... I know! ... Please open up the SW store already!! haha
5	This truck is a party in my mouth and the whole menu is invited. I start salivating at just the sight of the Slidin' Thru truck. All of the other reviews praising this truck are absolute truth and there isn't a whole lot more that needs to be commented on.All I can say is that I've been following the slider truck on twitter for quite some time and would follow this truck to the ends of the earth for a Barby slider. It's a succulent mini burger topped with melted cheddar cheese, carmalized jalapeno, barbeque sauce, fried onion crispies, and bacon.When it comes to the Vegas food truck scene, Slidin' Thru is king and all other trucks are just members of the court. And while I do like to have a romp with some of the other food trucks now and then for variety, Slidin' Thru can be sure that I'll always be coming back home to them.
4	I can't wait to visit my parents in Vegas again. Why? Because I am missing the burger and fries from this place. WOW just doesn't explain how delicious this place is.The menu is very unique, balsamic reduction with feta cheese and onions on fries. But let me say that the flavors are well on spot. There unusual toppings are a must have, someone has been doing there homework in flavor town.The decor is very cool, the bathrooms are chalkboard walls so you can leave a message for the next patron. There are some fun shirts hanging on the wall as well. The service was fast and friendly. I can see why my parents have this place as a staple. And since the burgers are so small, you get to try different flavors!Its located next to a strip mall so parking is in a lot. There is a drive thru, but it can get REALLY backed up during dinner.
3	Meh. Burgers are WAY over cooked...sweet potato fries are literally burnt. The regular fries and customer service is why this place gets 3 stars. I stopped by the truck and was disappointed so I decided to come to this location a few months later because I thought the poor quality was due to the high volume of business at Vegas Streats.... all hype no follow through. Ill pass.
2	Not impressed.  They didn't even have fries because their fryer wasn't working.
5	Yum! Sliders are fun and tasty with the bun being nice and sweet. They even have a drive thru. I really like that they have a brick and mortar place  now as I was never able to track down their truck. Now I can get their delicious sliders anytime.
4	Love this place. The burgers are tasty & they're sliders so you can try a couple different ones. I had the buffalo chicken & the BBQ burger. Very good. The fries were nice & crispy. Trendy decor. Definitely worth another trip :)
3	Very tasty food, great service, super far away, and really too expensive for what you get.  That is the summation of my experience here.The Chicky Boom and the YaYa were my sliders, and the Chicky Boom is the awesomes.  The service was great, seriously, everyone was super pleasant.  I only went here because I was on my way to Mt Charleston for the weekend and it was a pitstop, so I won't be making my way specifically out to get food here.  The worst part is that it's really too expensive for what you get.
5	At first I would have said the buns were too dry, but they fixed that. The new buns are just perfect. Or the meat was too small, they fixed that. Now these sliders are just big enough to be classified as a slider. I always get the YAYA and PEPPEP and they are amazingly good. I would recommend this place to anyone. Also they don't make it till you order it. So I know every time it's going to be hot and fresh. Too me that's worth the rather high price.
4	the sliders here are great, however the menu can be confusing for a first time customer especially if you drive thru. I will say though that the quality these guys put out is suburb and the fries are amazing. If you get the chance eat here or at their food truck, you won't regret it.
5	I LOVE this truck.  Supper yummy.  I even went to the store and it was just as good.
4	These guys have come to my office building twice and I missed them both times  I didn't try too hard to find them but when I saw them at a street fair I had to go and buy a few different things  (mini sliders) and I've regretted even more that I missed the times they stopped by the office.If you see this truck it's a must try. They are my 2nd favorite food truck in town and while I'd wish them to be #1 but I don't see them out and about as much as the other trucks and haven't built a caloric habit with them as bad as the truck I hold as number one see full list of food trucks if curious as I won't take away from the fact this is worth your time and money to stop by.
3	On my hunt for food trucks, this one was at the top of my list. I've heard good things about this one about how they're gourmet sliders and one of the best food trucks in town.  So my expectations were set pretty high. And that might have been the disadvantage to my taste buds. They're not bad at all, but it just tasted like regular sliders to me. Not really something to throw a parade over. They offer 7 different type of sliders and also a 'mystery slider', the chefs special of the day. I've tried the Barby, Pep Pep, and Captain's Order. Maybe because it was First Friday and they were quite busy, but I really couldn't differentiate the flavors between the three other than subtle differences in ingredients. I have to give them props on their truck though! Very nicely decorated and their website is fun to look at too. Looking at the pictures on their site gives me a feeling like I may have the wrong impression... but my stomach never lies. I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to have a go at it again, I think it's worth a shot.
5	At First Friday, I had a caprese. Now keep in mind that it had been months since I had eaten anything vaguely resembling anything close to cheese (Doctor's orders, no bovine milk!).It was pretty much a party in my mouth. I sat on the dirty street corner in downtown with my lovely boyfriend. I had my little caprese sliders in my lap, and I inhaled them and pretty much twitched around in wondrous admiration of the beautiful mix of mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar. That moment will always be etched into my mind.
5	these kids are the coolest kids in Vegas. They do Burgers GOOD! ;) You need to check their truck out or their NW location! Yummmmmmmmmm
4	So waiting 25 mins outside of a food truck for a burger is not the best part of the experience. But the burger was good. Sweet potato fries I'd pass on, not my favorite. But our burgers were dang good. Just be prepared to wait.
3	This is a tough one.This truck, as many know, has brought the food truck culture to Vegas. The number of things resulting from this truck and its leadership in the community is impressive. For this, it is a great truck.Now, about the food. I'll start with my favorite item. The lonesome dove. The pulled porky. It is fantastic. I will eat this any time, any day. Hundreds of them. Ok maybe not hundreds. Save them for the rest of the week, ya know? Everything else - no thanks (put down your pitchforks, please). I've had everything enough times to where I can say, "it needs more." I'm not saying it sucks, but I want more. I want a better patty. I want more flavor. I want less bun/white bread.Seriously, put down your pitchforks.I do love their specials, though. They are often original, creative, and delicious. Watch for them on Twitter or Facebook. I think their specials should become their primary menu. Now, that would be a menu worth visiting weekly again.
4	My son and I came here after an amazingly, beautiful day outside at the Butterfly park. I checked out the Yelp Monocle app to find this burger slider joint around 10 mins away.The concept of this restaurant is awesome! Live feed screens on the wall for Instagram, and Twitter updates using their hash tags, the modern paintings on the walls, etc. The one problem i had with this place was the cooks, and associates were all standing around, talking, and not checking on everybody in the restaurant and making sure to draw some nice comments or feedback from everybody eating their food, including my son and I. For a brand new business, especially one in the fast food industry, you want to be different, and by checking on everybody, and really caring about your guests means a lot, and goes a long way.When ordering off the menu, I knew the name of the restaurant was "Slidin Thru" but it did not dawn on me that the quantity, next to the burger, on the menu was for the number of sliders that come with your meal. I thought it was the quantity of patties that came on each burger. It would have been nice to have been asked by the cashier/order taker if i had ever been there before, and if i had any questions on how to order. Not knowing any info on this place, i ordered a single slider, and left wanting more. The burger that i had was really good! Balsamic Vin, Bleu Cheese, and Arugula on a slider sounded, and tasted delicious!  It was cooked perfectly, and the fries that came with it were also great! I will definitely be back, and this time i will know how to order.
3	The Porky is a great idea if you don't want a hamburger but my favorite is the buffalo soldier it is however pricey for what you get not for everyone in that aspect
5	I went to First Friday downtown last night.  The only thing I really wanted to eat was something off the Slidin' Thru food truck.  I had 1 little slider with rib meat, mushrooms, crispy onion and some kid of garlic sauce.  I have to say it was one of the best sandwiches I ever had in my life.  Great texture, great taste.  Nice and hot and fresh.  It was the only think I've had off the truck but I will be back for more very very soon!
3	I have always been enamored by the food truck culture, but with my busy schedule I find it challenging to search them out. With that said, I was pretty stoked when I learned that our community center on base is organizing Food Truck Fridays. We had such a good turnout that 1 of the 3 trucks ran out of food early on. Fortunately we still were able to get some grub from Slidin' Thru, which was what I really came out there for.What I love about their business is their website. I think websites for food trucks are their most essential tool, as it has to be frequently updated and easy enough to navigate. So from their online menu, I already know what I wanted to try: Plain Jane, Pulled Porky, and the Barby. I placed my order and was told about a 15-20 minute wait. I was a bit disappointed that their pricing is a little bit different. I thought you would get 3 sliders for $7 based on previous Yelp reviews, but it's actually $3 for each slider now. I got the food and was instantly underwhelmed. Zero presentation was put into the sliders which looked, well, sloppy. I can understand if they were busy, but there were only 2 people ahead of me waiting when I ordered. The sliders were good. Maybe a little bit too much BBQ sauce for my personal taste, but the Pulled Porkie easily came out on top. Maybe I'm being a little bit critical here but I was really hoping for a much better experience. It's my first visit, so I would still like to try their other sliders in the future. There's just a lot more food trucks to be experienced in Vegas so for now I'm moving on.
1	The burgers might be good but they totally flaked on my buddies event because they felt they had somewhere better to be. Not cool man!
3	Here is my breakdown when I had Sliding Thru (Food Truck) a few days ago:FOOD: Pulled Porky (slow cook pork, caramelized jalapeno, and bbq sauce) - this was my least favorite of the sliders.  I really wanted to like it because there has been some decent reviews on this truck but I think the biggest problem I had with this slider was that they didn't create a sauce that went well with it  - an aioli would have been amazing with it!!Barby (beef, chedder, jalapeno, onion, and bbq sauce) - It was an okay slider.  The taste wasnt bad, but I think because of the way the slider was described (caramelized jalapeno and crispy onion strips) I was expecting a lot more.  Caprese (eggplant, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and balsamic) - by far my favorite out of what I ordered that day.  The eggplant wasn't sliced too thin and the overall flavor was good.  The thing that would have made this slider even better was to toast the bun ^_^ So you get that texture when you bite into it.  Fries - meh, fries are friesSERVICE:  The staff was friendly but the wait for the food was rather long considering they came to an event and should have expected it to be busy.
5	Best sliders in town, can't beat the price and they are just awesome. Pulled porky is my favorite along with pep pep. Great combination of flavors, the only bad thing is waiting in line.
5	So I happen to be at Vegas Streats this past weekend and I had to get a Ya-Ya. Delish, flavorful slider with lettuce, tomato (I normally hate tomato btw, but these slices where like Greek God Tomato quality), red onion, feta cheese crumbles, tzatsiki sauce and a splash of red wine vinegar. So fresh, made to order, genius I tell you!
1	Don't want to waste much time on the review, as I already wasted time dining there.1. Overpriced,  $2.50-4.00, for what I estimate is a 1 ounce patty burger, (do the math, that would mean the equivalent of a 1/4 lb burger would be $10.00-16.00, a 1/2 lb burger would be $20.00-32.00. At a hole in the wall building, in a strip mall)?2. Atmosphere not to my liking,( like dining in a cartoon strip), but that's a personal taste.3. Food.taste was alright, nothing to write home about.For what I paid for the burger, fries and drink I could have had a 1/4 lb burger, fries & drink, that tasted better, at any number of restaurants in town.I don't mind paying for good food, this isn't it, I won't be back.This was written when they were located at Durango and Centennial.
4	I haven't been back since the company was sold and with any change, I wondered if the consistency would fare well. I came with the BF and Angela H. for dinner. I don't know if it's just me, but the sliders seem a teeny bit bigger? Like the buns have changed and thus the burger reflects that. Chicky Boom is one of my favorite things here, even though it's the non-slider, slider. This visit the dressing of it was a bit more lemony, which was a positive in my book. My favorite slider is the Barby and that was just the same as well. Fries, crisp and hot. Sweet potato fries are lightly cinnamon-y, sweet and a bit salty. The added tiny bit of salt makes a difference. The tier system is a bit different than my last visit. Now the more of the same sliders you get, you get a price break of 25-50 cents off each one, or bit of a discount to order a combo than a la carte, etc. A combo meal will run you $6- 8.99 depending on how many sliders. The girl in the front was friendly thought definitely not fist bump-y. That I can take it or leave it though. I wasn't asked to say anything embarrassing for a discount so I don't know if they do that still.It's the same in the food where it counts. The way it should be. Whoever Ric sold to, it's in good hands.
5	1 word: Bombdiggy! Secondly, I brought my Gf here and she loved the Sliders she ordered ! Like Arnold says: " I'll be back" .. Soon! Aloojah
2	One star was lost for each of the following:The service: They have started to serve customers 1 hour and 40 minutes later then scheduled. Nothing was said like "we are sorry to keep you waiting". Last 20 minutes before opening the cook was just walking around smoking a cigarette and texting on his phone. If they don't understand the concept of time they should just say: "we will open some time today"The food: Sliders were good but the pulled porky slider had a completely soaked bottom bun that was falling apart and making a mess. I opened a box 20 seconds after I got it so maybe they should use better buns or toast them or something.The value for money: they didn't have any special offers like 3for$7 that you can see on some pictures here. They charged $3 for each tiny slider that you need 3-4 to feel something in your stomach. In N Out burger will take the 2nd place when compared to them but will no doubt win the value for money contest.
4	I've heard multiple sources saying this was a must try food truck, so I was very excited once StrEATS came around.I had the pulled pork slider and plain Jane (just a normal slider) with a side of sweet potato fries.  These sliders are really good and remind me of a better version of White Castle.  The sweet potato fries make an excellent ending to the meal.I look forward to going back and trying their other varieties!
2	First, I must say that I was a huge fan of Slidin' Thru HQ located on paradise. Their pulled porky and barby fries were ridiculously good! Since they have moved to the other side of town, I have only frequented their location twice and both occassions the food was just okay. Today a co-worker and I visited their food truck since it was right down the street from the office. Service was good. The cashier was friendly. I was dissappointed that they do not offer their specialty fries from the truck but no big deal. I went ahead and order my pulled porky that I love so much and sweet potato fries. The fries were good. The pulled porky on the other hand is no longer anything I would ever order again. Another reviewer had mentioned the soggy bun and I completely agree. The porky consisted of tasteless pulled pork (they used to crisp it a bit) drowning in bbq sauce and a few chopped jalapenos which were definitely not carmelized. I only give two stars due to the girl who took my order. I am not certain what happened to their quality but I do not recommend.
4	If you're looking to add a flare of whimsical personality to your wedding, the food and the caterer you choose is a detail you can not overlook! Slidin' Thru was that perfect detail for us. Some of the biggest complaints about a wedding is always about the food, but that is one worry you can cross off your list is you use this company. The food is made to order for each guest so everyone gets what they want and it's hot when they get it. They use a numbered ticket system but it's not really too long of a wait...no one complained at our wedding. The company will even do custom orders like adding street tacos or the meal you ate on your first date to your menu! Also, if you are an Eco-friendly bride, don't forget to ask for their green serving containers. Easy to work with, EXCELLENT food! Unbelievably low prices! We are excited to hire this company for future events.
4	Solid sliders. The sweet potato fries are awesome and the prices are more than fair. Only downside is the first time I was there, the shake machine was broken and the second time they were out of the chicken boom sliders.
5	I've heard the buzz about this place but I was SUPER impressed.  Everything was good but the PepPep and Captain's Order were off the charts great.  PepPep pays homage to an In-in-Out burger but the Captain is the best burger I've ever had. Perfection.
2	Man, I spoke too soon that it was in good hands. The BF and I were hurrying off to a busy day and needed a snack as we had a early dinner to get to. We both grab a barby and share regular fries. Things have changed since the last visit drastically. The burger patty was very, very thin. Think of White Castle type patty when these originally started pretty fat when Ric owned it. When I grabbed my burger the basket had a pool of oil. The flavor was okay because of the bbq sauce, but it was mostly bread and greasy onion crisps (which probably caused the pool of oil).The fries changed in that the thin crisp breaded shoestring fries are now thicker fries,- think like 5 guys like. They weren't very crisp and were soggy on the bottom since they got crammed in the cu and just steamed themselves. Girl up at front was much more quiet and not as personable as previous counter folks. $9 for this 2 slider, fries and drink combo isn't worth it when those sliders are super skimpy. They used to be worth it when they were fat and juicy. Just look at the photos from the beginning vs. now... they recently fused the truck reviews with the reviews for the brick location and you can see the difference. I should've stopped and taken a picture, but I was in a hurry and just jamming something in my mouth in the 5 minutes I had to spare. This wasn't the burgers with heart that sold itself. Also Ric WAS Slidin' Thru and the personality carried through in the staff he picked. It's missing that little sumthin' sumthin' on top of being skimpy. I regret that I will not be back.
4	Very hip, nice staff. The menu is really good but a bit heavy/greasy. I will be returning!
4	I tired the Plain Jane and the Porky. The Porky was by far better. The Plain Jane is a normal slider but the Porky was a luscious slow roasted pork coated with BBQ sauce. The fries also were very warm and tasted like freshly cut potatoes.
4	I finally got around to checking Slidin' Thru today.  And I don't know why it took me so long!  Hallelou, I have seen the light!My husband and I went here for lunch today while we were out and about.  I tried the Peppep and the Buffalo Soldier sliders.  I really enjoyed them both, but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.  My hubby tried the Porky and the Plain Jane.  I stole a bite of the Porky and almost didn't give the slider back because it was so yummy. I totally couldn't have eaten a 3rd slider, but I didn't want to look like a pig, especially since my hubby only ate 2.  The fries were really good too.  They tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.  YUMMY.  Take a bunch of napkins though.  The sliders were saucy (in a very good way) and did kinda get all over the place.  Double yummy on the saucy sliders!I do think the prices are a bit high.  For what we got on the sandwiches, I think $0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.  Even with that, I think we will be back regularly.  The prices on fries and drinks were spot on though, in my opinion.On a side note, the place was completely empty our entire meal.  Even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.  We didn't really see the staff either.  It was a little weird, but when we did see them, they were friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I think if they were a little more present and didn't disappear for long periods of time, it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.  I hope we just went during a weird time or something, because now I am hooked and want them to stay around!!!Another positive was a free slider just for checking in on Yelp.  Now that is a great deal!  How I love free food!
1	They refused to honor their living social deal at vegas streets last Sat.   Staff argued with us that our voucher wasn't valid even though it still has a $5 value until the year 2017.  They have lost a customer over $5.  I contacted them through their website and got no response either...poor customer service.The burgers were good the first time we ate them about a year ago.  The last time the quality was definitely lacking.  Since I had this voucher hanging around I figured we would try it once again.  Nope!  Never Again!  There's way better food options at Vegas Streets anyway.
1	Ok went about a month ago just forgot to review this place first off when I went only one person was working he was the cook and cashier? The food was cold I rather have a mcdouble at McDonald's people over rate this place
4	Place is very clean, I don't know why this stood out but it did. I got the Barby slider, was a tasty little burger. I could see myself stopping in from time to time.
2	When we walked in it was a little awkward because there was no one in the restaurant and then suddenly a girl popped out and greeted us. She was very nice and she was patient while my husband was deciding on his order. We told her we had the Yelp check in freebie and she smiled big, which was cool for us because it gave us a free slider!  We ordered and she brought out our food in no time and it was nice and hot and fresh. But then she kind of disappeared into the back and my husband and I were all alone in the dining area. There was literally no one in the restaurant. So for our food..... I got the Plain Jane, while my husband had the Plain Jane and the Buffalo Soldier. I thought the Plain Jane was a pretty decent little slider, it was juicy and if it only had some minced onions on it, it would have been perfect. While I didn't try it, my husband said his Buffalo Soldier was enjoyable.The cheapest sliders started at $3.00 apiece and they went up from there. I think most people would probably want to order a minimum of two sliders. Plus most people would probably order fries and a drink too. So it could get a little pricey. Maybe it was the weird Twilight Zone ambiance but I like Slidin' Thru as a Food Truck better than an actual sit down restaurant. So if $3.00 is the going rate for a slider with nothing more that cheese and ketchup, I would much rather be at a fun event like First Friday or StrEats with my best Gal Pals or on a hot date with my hubby having fun eating off the food truck, rather than in a stark white restaurant where I feel like I am on the set of Punked'.
4	I know Slidin' Thru has been around for some time now, at least 2 years.  But I never had the opportunity to eat here until last night.  Our original plan was Tea Time for boba, but ended up here instead since they were closed at the time.  What you get at Slidin' Thru is basically sliders that are infamously sold through their food trucks.  There's a list of sliders that you opt for, including pork and chicken. It was my first visit and decided on the Captain's Orders and the YaYa. Each slider is $3.50.  However, one is free when you check in through your Yelp app.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Both sliders were extremely tasty and full of flavor.  The YaYa was a little rich for me.  It's all good since I went back and forth taking bites out of the YaYa and Captain's Order.  We also washed down our sliders with some of their delicious sweet potato fries.  Perfect combination if you ask me.  I've been told that Slidin' Thru restaurant isn't as good as their actual food trucks. I wouldn't know the difference since I never had a slider from their food trucks.  All I know is that at this joint, their sliders are good enough for me to want more and cheap enough for me to come back.
4	Good... just a ways to get there if you don't live in north town.
5	Delicious food and checking in I got a free slider! Fries are great and their ice is better than sonics!
2	Utterly disappointing. Between the fact that I'd seen this burger on some top burgers in America lists and the fact that yelpers rated it a four star I was expecting something really good at minimum. I have several burgers on my list to try the summer while in vegas. I was also really craving a good burger this day and still am. Unfortunately I came up short. I think the slider ideal is better suited for the food truck instead of a sit down restaurant. I ordered the peppep and the barby. Getting one free with my yelp check in. When I got my order I actually had four burgers on my tray. I told the lady that only ordered to two. They ended up giving me them because they have already made them. My biggest thought here is where's the beef, Obviously it's a slider so there's a little beef to be had. When I say deconstructed 2 of my burgers to make one bigger burger I can actually taste the meat and it was decent, not great, but decent. I think I would stay away from this restaurant especially if you have to drive far out of your way like I did you get here. Aswell this place also had sweet potato fries which seems to be the norm at most restaurants nowadays. The difference here if they actually put sugar on their fries. If I want to eat sweet potato fries because I am trying to be healthy, I don't need the added sugar. Unfortunately the fries were good but the sugar made it not so orderable if you're trying to be healthy. One final thought I think I would just stay away the next time I'm craving a burger if this is my option.
1	had the worst experience with the food truck at first friday with a  horribly rude employee working the window. I purchased food and saw my food sit on the counter as new orders were stacked on top of mine  3 more orders to be exact. The 4 orders sat for 4-5 minutes waiting on fries and as the orders were being called mine now on the bottom was called last order 96 as i saw her hand out 99 98 97 as i was asking for my order she ignored me as i asked her why it was waiting on the bottom WHEN I DIDNT ORDER FRIES!!!! I still had to wait for them because they were busy then the employee told me to shut up and refused to refund my order. With so much competition its not a great idea to blow off your guests!! Never again;(
5	After pissing away most of my settlement money the night before at the Exscamibur and recovering from what most likely will be a life debilitating neck injury from riding the roller coaster at New York, New York I decided to take the advice of a local on where to eat. He was a cool dude from the local Chevy dealership that came to pick me up to get my car. My car overheated in the mild Baker 117 degree sun on the way there. I asked him where the locals eat that is far away from all the dopey SEC frat boy tourists. If you are staying on the strip it is a butt turd of a drive. It is all the way north off the 215 and Durango, but hell do you want something affordable and awesome or do you want more $5 green hot dogs, from the Sherwood Forest bar at the Excalibur, with buns so hard it would make a stripper from the Crazyhorse III blush???? Exactly. Anyways the s'mores sweet potato fries are so good they made me forget about the $1,200 I lost to my good friend Wang the blackjack dealer the night before.
5	Slidin thru is soooooo yummy! The yaya is my fave one..but really they are ALL amazers. The owner and staff are so nice here. Great service always makes great food taste even better. :)
5	The burgers are always flavorful, never greasy. Great chicken slider and I like the vegetarian one too!  The fries are super filling if you get them with toppings, so be prepared to share.  Sometimes they can be a little slow, but the food is so good who cares. Love the super hero theme!
3	In the few years that Rex has been on this planet...385 to be exact...he has learned a few things. First, never fight a naked man unless you are also naked. Sounds counter-intuitive, Rex understands that, but the degradation of fighting a naked man while clothed is too much for most people to handle.  Second, Xenu is real and when that guy comes back you are all in trouble.  Third, if you work on a movie set never scream "all the chicks around here look a little pudgy...without clearing out your ex-lax and diet pill collection. That feeding frenzy can last for weeks.  Lastly, Rex rarely...more rare than crumbs on Orson Welles shirt...will a food experience be better the second time when it was disappointing the first time. A second bite of that old apple is usually the apple that leaves pesticide on your lips and a worm that doesn't get you high in your stomach. Gentlemen, and other scumbags, this is doubly true for your experience with the ladies.  First time you are with them it is okay...second time...the always hide the valuables you didn't take and make sure no cash is in the house. Tricky tricky.Rex was disappointed when he went to the Slidin' Thru food truck a few years ago. Long line. Little pay off. The burger was okay, but they were all overcooked.  An overcooked burger is like Rex after too much of his homemade punch (1 part Smith's brand Draino, 2 parts powdered eggs, 3 parts Von's brand Windex, 4 parts water from Lake Mead)...burned past the point of good taste.  Rex is a fiend on punch. A punching fiend.  The burgers on line were tasty because of the unique flavors, but the burger itself was a letdown due to the hour long line. In all fairness they would have been a let down on a 3 minute line.  Creativity is great. It is flair. Flair is great. Rick Flair is great. Flair is what got David Copperfield girls while looking like a wax statue of a man made by a blind person with 4 fingers. 3 flares and a canister of propane got Rex 8 months. Flair can overcome a lot. The problem with flair is that it fades quickly...like drinking ammonia or dating Taylor Swift.  Both come on strong but are no good in bed. (Ammonia releases the bowels...much like TS's music.)  Flair is for gimmick hungry newbies. Slidin Thru felt like gimmicks the first time to Rex and Rex NEVER went back. Until Rex was eventually dragged back...but this time to the Slidin' Thru restaurant and this time by his new woman Martha "Skin Sack" Sugarmanington. Skin Sack told me that these burgers were good. She begged. She implored. She used her feminine wiles. Then she did the only thing that Rex can't resist. She paid.  So Skin Sack and I headed up to what felt like Utah by the time we got there. Could this place be any further out?  Next time why not just make a lean-to out in the desert?  Rex was annoyed. An annoyed Rex is a projectile vomiting Rex.  Not good for Skin Sack's bike...but that girl can peddle. Rex is happy to say that Slidin' Thru was MUCH better than before. The Pulled Porky, obviously named after Skin Sack before the operation, was the very good.   Rex loves pulling on her skin as she peddles me around town. Rex cuddles up in it on a cool night.  Rex pulls some skin over his head as a skin shade.  To me the best two burgers came down to the old standby...the Pep Pep. Cooked well, made with care, and packed with flavor...but...I have to give the nod to the Chicky Boom.  The sriracha is the star of this sandwich.  Great addition burst of flavor, some heat, a little needed complexity. Excellent sandwich. The regular fries were good, but the sweet potato fries we excellent. Crunchy, soft on the inside. Really a nice sweet component to cut through the richness of the burgers.Rex has complaints.  The Captain's Order is bordering on vile. The flavors don't work. They went for a Greek thing, but it is like watching Greco-Roman Wrestling...odd, off putting and a waste of time.  The Caprese is such a great concept...but it was terribly under seasoned and the sauce reduction too sweet. Also of all our burgers, and we ordered a lot...we did get some that were borderline overcooked. None were as terrible as the truck, but still...this place isn't cheap. Rex isn't going to the ends of the earth to get stuff that is hit and miss. Skin Sack worked hard to get us there...she deserves better than standing outside while Rex spends her money and she is forced to watch Rex eat food that isn't subject to better quality control.Rex has one big problem and it goes back to the truck issue...Slidin' Thru is popular. They do well. They have a fan base.  That is all great. Rex has a feeling what they don't have is exacting standards for their food. They love tattoos and having fun, working hard and creating interesting flavors...but they don't love holding themselves to a higher standard each and every time they cook. They push burgers. Which is fine...but what about more? Some love a cool concept...but everyone loves a great burger.
4	Pricing was great they specialize on just sliders and are priced appropriately the taste of the sliders were pretty good didnt expect to have so much choices on their sliders. The Flavors were fusion some were good combination some were so so otherwise it was a good dining experience.
3	Creative and interesting menu. Price wise, they are ok. Could be a bit more budget friendly and a bigger selection of food items. Not a place I would eat at often, but if I was in the area and wanted a not-so typical burger then this is the place to stop at.
4	Best sliders ever!! I discovered this location by accident after moving to the Centennial area and driving around one day. I had seen their food trucks at valley events before but there was always too long of a line. If you like burgers/sliders with lots of delicious toppings then this is the place to go. My favs are the Barby and Chicky Boom (chicken salad). There's never really a crowd here and the service is fast. The dining area is very clean and modern as well, and of course they also have a drive thru.
4	Well I'm not much of a food truck kinda guy. No offense just never got into the craze. Seems like a lot of them try to be too gourmet. But not this one. Slidin Thru was cool. The truck design was cool, the menu was simple, the food was good. Not too pricey and they were actually the first sliders I'd ever had in my life. Very delish!  They were very friendly and prepared my food promptly. I'd definitely try them out again. Thanks for making me a believer in food trucks!
2	Food was okay but seemed overpriced for 2 sliders, fries and a can of soda.Got the sweet potato fries which were okay but the way they just clumped the sugar on them was lame.  Two fries were soaked in sugar but the rest had none.  Meh.The sliders were average, nothing great.  I'd eat it again if I was hungry and it was nearby but I wouldn't make an effort to eat here again.
2	Wtf happened?????? The don't do the check in offers anymore. They don't have internet to use credit cards. They don't have icecream to make shakes. I guess the fastest way to drive a business to the ground is to have crappy management, crappy business plan. At least the fries and the yaya were still good.
4	Used to love this place. The pep pep and captains order were very good. I guess the owner decided to part ways and works for a casino on the strip now. After that I guess they started going down hill. It's a bummer their restaurant on Durango closed
5	Great! I've been here 3 or 4 times and I've loved it every time. Barby fries and sliders are amazing. The captains fries are pretty good but the captains order slider is great. One of the best places just outside Vegas
5	The pulled porky was de-lish!..
5	We had the truck at our office party yesterday, and it was fabulous, everything was made to order, and the staff gave rave reviews.  125 people were served efficiently and in 1/2 hour there were no lines, standing in line gave staff time to meet and greet.  It was a great day, highly recommend Slidin Thru for your office function.  They were very easy to work with and their staff is top notch 5* A+
