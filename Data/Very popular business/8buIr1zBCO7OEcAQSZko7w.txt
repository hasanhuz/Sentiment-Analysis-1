4	A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. I went there with my mom and aunt and several friends and really enjoyed myself.They're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious!UPDATE:Do not miss the Thai beef salad.And skip the tuna tartare!
4	AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Thankfully you can sit at the bar and apparently the place has regulars so pull your stool up to one of them, and if sober, they'll tell you what's good or not.This joint is jumping and its easy to understand why; the service is fast and friendly, the food is very tasty, a bit creative and very inexpensive.  My and my hungry mouth sister went and with cocktails had a bill of only $30.  I thought I was back in South America and the menu's latin style flavor only reinforces that.We passed on the famous (soaks 3 days for flavor!) sangria but enjoyed a number of delights.  Their signature Firefly fries are a bit greasy but quite tasty.
5	This was my favorite meal in Vegas.  The tapas were tasty, and though Spanish cuisine is usually difficult for a vegan I found plenty to eat.  The blood orange mojitos were great.  The servers were very cool, projecting a low key but attentive persona.  I would certainly eat here again.  The tomato soup is fabulous.  The patio is painted in a scuffed red and is delightful if you can stand the smokers.
4	Came here for a friend's bday celebration this weekend. Pretty good tapas place a street parallel of the strip. Everything was pretty reasonably priced and the food was pretty yummy. After a couple Heine's, sangrias and Millers we got a bit rowdy but it was all in fun and other people seemed to be tolerable of the racket we caused. Minus a star for not being able to sing Happy Birthday to their diners. We had to do that ourselves and had a great time. =)
3	Pretty good tapas, but a total douche-fest. Nothing but fake tittie bitches and Federline-looking losers.
4	My friend lives for this place - taking all visitors to Vegas to one his favorite spots to drink, eat and be merry.We started off with a pitcher of the White Sangria ($18.00).  It was nice to even have that option.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of fruit. If you read any of previous entries regarding sangria, I live for all that fruit shit marinating in the wine!  So, bring it on! I remember getting a complimentary  Firefly*fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) to start of our meal - anything complimentary is ALWAYS appreciated!  Some of the tapas we ordered included Stuffed dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) $4,  Patatas bravas (roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli) $4.50, and some kind of meat tapa.  Sadly, I can't remember much else about what we had that evening. In all fairness, I didn't have much of an appetite.  I was, uh *ahem*, recovering still and couldn't enjoy the various goodies that arrived at our table.But I would definitely give it another go because I usually love tapas and I'm confident that if I was in my healthy state, this place would rate higher.Update! 02/26/07 - I finally got around to trying this place out again, and this time I was healthy and hungry!  It's Friday night and packed!  With an hour and half wait, we wing it outside under the heating lamps.  They started us off with bread, some type of buttery spread, and olives.  We ordered the ceviche of shrimp, which was tiger shrimp, avocado, and two corn tortilla chips ($8.50).  The ceviche was good, not sure how much shrimp was actually in the dish though and only two chips?  The roasted eggplant cannelloni, made with goat cheese and tomato sauce ($5.00) was a surprise hit.  It came in a set of three and the BF definitely plans on ordering this one again.  Tasty, especially if you're a goat cheese lover.  We order the lamb chops medium, and they came a bit overcooked.  With two chops, a red wine reduction, and sauteed lentils and veggies ($8.50), you got a bit more bang for your buck.  The baked filets of grouper that are marinated with herbs, lemon and garlic ($6.50) came with three pieces and lacked flavor.  I ended up using the sauce from my ceviche to give it a kick.  The pulpo asado, which is marinated and grilled octopus with a few red potatoes and chopped tomatoes ($7.50) was okay too.  We finished off with the BF's favorite - Banana-Nutella Sandwiches ($5.00).  This came with four triangles and you're supposed to dip it into the Nutella sauce.  The sauce was cold when we got it, but the BF claims it's usually served warm.  With a party of four, we shared a pitcher of their passion fruit Mojitos ($7.00/glass; $28.00/pitcher) that was pretty yummy.  (I love mojitos!)Overall, the food was okay.  We couldn't enjoy their meat dishes as much b/c our company was doing the "No Meat Friday" thing.  I'm upping my star rating from a three to a four because the atmosphere is good, and with tapas, everyone seems to have a good time.  I would definitely recommend making reservations though for busy evenings!Happy Hour is Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 6 pm.  1/2 Firefly Drinks (sangria, mojitos, specialty martinis, and infused vodka) and well drinks.  Appetizer plate is includedAppetizer plate included, which is 1 stuffed date, 1 albondiga, and 1 tortilla espanola.
3	A great location that's somewhat off the Strip, but very close to all the major hotels - easily accessible if you have a car.  The bar was a little tight, but it's a very popular location.  Great music, even though when I was eating, there wasn't a live band.  It's not the most authentic Spanish food around, but it's a great departure from the standard steakhouses and buffets in Vegas.BTW, I realized that if you say "I'm going to a tapas bar" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.PROS:- Reasonably priced (about $25/pp with some drinks)- Wide variety of choices on the menu- White wine sangria is very light and easy to drink- I really liked the empanadas, duck rolls, and - In a plaza with several restaurants, including Ruth's Chris - so if there's a long wait, there is always an alternativeCONS:- The paella was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a tapas bar- The bruschetta was a close second
3	The food here was surprisingly good and the service was perfect.  I ordered several tapas...the best was the calamari and the worst was the octopus (it was like a "fear factor" challenge).  Even though the food was exceptional, I can't imagine returning since it just wasn't my scene.  Any time I looked around the room, I was horrified by the other people there.  Mostly 30-something's who get their fashion ideas from TRL (the table near me had a young father with a mohawk and his little baby had a mohawk too).   Now that I think about it, there was a lot of bad hair.
4	If you're in the mood for tapas. Check out Firefly on Paradise next time you're in Las Vegas. Located off the strip and away from all the riff raff, Firefly offers yummy ceviche of red snapper, stuffed dates, roasted eggplant canneloni, tuna carpaccio, baked shrimp with roasted garlic cream, chorizo clams, empanadillas, skewer of beef, and so much more. I had a great experience here, much better than any of the overpriced fine dining restaurants in Vegas.With excellent service and reasonable prices. Tourists, venture off of Las Vegas Blvd and onto Paradise Road!!
4	whenever i have guests coming to vegas wanting to eat well, drink well, and be merry...i take them to firefly.  they serve spanish tapas, they have pitchers of delicious sangria, they have live music on certain evenings, it's off the strip, and they are open late.  start off with a pitcher of sangria.  i recommend the white if you have a bunch of newbies that don't like wine too much.  i usually have the ceviche w red snapper, the boquerones which are spanish white anchovies on toasts w/roasted red pepper, my absolute favorite almond and blue-cheese stuffed sweet dates that are wrapped in salty fatty bacon. garlicky and cheezy firefly fries, my other favorite merguez ([spicy lamb sausage), tender sweet lamb chops, camarones a la diabla, and to finish it off with the extrodinary banana-nutella sandwiches.i wouldnt recommend this place as nice great date place because it does get loud when it's very busy and with live music playing in the background.  they also have outdoor seating.  this place can get really busy.  i would call in advance to see if reservations are needed.  this is a really fun place to go to.
4	So I went to this place with pals J. and M. It was my last night hanging out in Vegas, and we were talking about coming here because of two things we have a love of: bacon, and mojitos. Well, I was satisfied.This little tapas bar was definitely full of an early evening swingles crowd in sequined halters and those non-wrinkle-able slacks, but there were also some large groups and families sitting around. We got a table outside on the heated patio and the waiter brought a basket of yummy crostinis, black olives, and a sweet/garlicy butter. I had a raspberry mojito, and also tried the blood orange one. Both were delicious and I'm sure the other selections from the bar are just as good. Absolutely, you must try the figs wrapped in bacon in a red wine reduction, and the tuna tartar. Although not enough taro chips for the tuna tartar.Other things worth trying are a variety of skewers, ceviche, and artichoke toasts. Our service was incredibly slow, although supposedly that is not the case at Firefly usually.
5	i live in vegas and this restaurant is one of my favorite places.for tourists, if you wanna jus chill and hang away from the strip, this is the perfect place. their sangrias (both red & white kinds) are Bomb! it's a tapas joint, so many varieties of different kinds of foods (not just spanish food either) but they have mini burgers, beef tenderloin skewers, ribs, veggie dishes, and of course desserts (my favorite is this banana one that you can dip into hazelnut chocolate) anyways, long story short, great drinks and food at an affordable price, so def check it out!
4	A nice inexpensive, Spanish tapas restaurant located off the strip. I went there with my friend Tabitha her boyfriend, and a three other mutual friends. They make a pretty good mojito. All of my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. And yes there open late.
4	Was taken here for a business outing during my trip to Vegas for a conference.  How did I like it?  Luved it....sure did.....not only because it was off the strip and outside of a casino with fresh air and without the sounds of slot machine bells but because the food and sangria were d-lish-us.  Damn straight.  If you go, try to take friends.  Tapas are meant to be shared so the more people, the more plates.  Order the empanadas, the duck rolls, the cerviche, and most everything on the menu.  I am not a fan of lamb so I stayed away from those dishes.Atmosphere was pretty good and music generated a great vibe in the place.  Definitely recommend it.  **They just opened a sister joint next door called Dragonfly.  It's a sushi place.
5	So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we'll talk about that later.Tapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It's like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday's, but good.Firefly friend pleaser's.......Jug O' Red Sangria                                               Baked Brie and/or Cheese & Meat Plate                                               EmpanadasYummy and way fun to share.  An awesome bar.  Thankfully a bar that knows how to make a kick ass martini.  Cuz when the Sangria is gone you might as well kick it up a notch. BAM!!!And it sports a pleasing trendy atmosphere at Happy Hour.  Believe me....wall to wall SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE.   Men who use product, and the women who love them.  Wink, wink.
3	Rachael Ray led me astray...  I tried this place after seeing RR's review on her show.  While the atmosphere and ambiance are nice, you'll leave finding the food mediocre at best.
3	So I guess this is Tapas Day. So Firefly - I've driven by so many times - Saw it on Rachel Ray's $40 a day....Hmmm finally went there and was quite impressed. BTW THERE IS NO THAI BEEF SALAD IN SPAIN. Whatever and your tapas fusion. Overall - great atmosphere. A little Loud....Drinks are delish. Hmmm Reading all reviews...I'm just gonna copy and paste everyone's to make my own :) Mwahahaha Behold Plagerism!!!A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas.AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Firefly is a welcome alternative to the overpriced strip restaurants and clubs.  This is where all of the local crowd hangs out.  It's up the street from the Hard Rock, quick cab-ride from the strip.  Great food, hip but relaxed atmosphere.  Open late with DJ's and more of a bar/loungey crowd the later it gets.  BTW, I realized that if you say "I'm going to a tapas bar" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.

Mwahahaha and that is my review completely not plagerized and true...No Really I knocked it for the crowdedness, and noise levels, oh and for we had really crappy seats when we went....table small. Myke SMASH....
5	Basically all I can say, because I'm apparently the last person on earth to go here, is:Hey everyone!  I agree!Holy poop is this stuff excellent!I suggested this last night on a whim.  I've been before, but always with people who didn't want to wait.  We did have to wait about 25 - 30 minutes, but my dining partner assured me it was worth it.  We were able to get a seat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria to share.    They have two sangria varieties - red wine and white wine.  We had the white wine and it was delicious - light and refreshing.After we were seated we were seen promptly by our waiter and it didn't take long for us to choose our selections, all of which were marvelous.  We had the filet mignon sliders, baked brie, camarones a la diabla, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Everything was prepared perfectly and was absolutely delicious.  The sauce on the shrimp was divine, and the brie was paired with some deliciously roasted tomatoes.The only downside was that our waiter seemed to forget about us after our food had arrived and we sat without the bill for a while.  But, while we sat we talked about how good the food was.Recommended for any occasion.  So flippin' good.
4	Wanting to stay away from the hotel dining  scene we headed over to "Firefly"!  Holy crap....This place was PACKED on Friday night.  Luckily we had a reservation for 6 and only waited for a about 10mins for a table.  Without reservations we would have been looking at at least an hour wait.  Overall we had a great experience.   The sangria was good and the tapas were even better.  Great little people watching spot to boot.  And last but not least, since I treated my peeps it wasn't  too hard on my AMEX card.  We will definitely be back...
4	A great tapas restaurant! Had trouble deciding what to order because there're so many things on the menu I want to try. Of course I ordered the mushroom tart because I LOVE mushroom (see my russian family bistro review). The fried calamari is a bit oily though. Everything else was good, but not so spectacular that I remember the individual dish to put on this review.We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, but later on I found out that I actually do not like sangria. So my boy had to finish the whole pitcher by himself. Not that he's complaining.I'd definitely come back!
4	If you are like me, every time you go to a restaurant and take a look at the menu you wish you can be gluttonous and order everything on the menu because you either can't narrow it down to just one dish or you just want a little taste of everything. Look no further....Firefly is just the remedy if ever you are in that situation. A Tapas restaurant and favorite local hangout, Firefly's atmosphere is just as cool as it's food!! My favorites are the Surf and Turf Skewers, Tuna Tartar, Baked Brie, Crab-cake Sliders and of course the Sangria!! If you are looking for great, inexpensive food, awesome atmosphere that is open late and even has happy hour....Firefly is definitely for you!!
5	4/19/07Hands down the best Tapas and Sangria place I've ever been to.  Including NYC and Europe.  Great atmosphere, location, music, staff.  Nothing lacking here, except maybe more parking spots.  A great find in the land of CORPORATE Dining.And those mentioning all the fake boobies and K-Fed lookalikes...  HELLO!  This IS Vegas, they're everywhere!!!  And TAPAS is about little dishes to talk over and socialize over.  It doesn't have to stick to traditional Spanish ingredients.
2	The light sangria was good- although a bit tooo "iced up" and the chunks of fruit needs to be a little bigger. The stuffed dates would have been good if the bacon wasn't to dry or crisp- i think prosciutto would've worked better...but the sliders were good. the ambiance kind of sucked- we ate outside and it was literally in the middle of the parking lot- it would have been nice if they could've covered it with greenery or face the outside dining on the sidewalk to see passer-by's even then it was kind of whacked...i guess coming from the hotels and all of sudden being out in the middle of the parking lot- i have to take off points for the ambiance...our waiter kind of sucked too- you would think they would at least talk about the menu a bit and be excited about being there! i guess if you're gonna check this place out- I suggest you eat inside- the place is forgettable not one i'd go back to when I'm Vegas...I've had better tapas and sangrias...
5	This is my favorite nightspot in Vegas. Amazing sangria, great tapas, good looking people. It's gotten a bit too busy recently, but the attention is justified.
3	You definately have to make reservations for this place. It gets packed during dinner time and it's a rather small joint. I went with a big party so i pretty much tried everything. I really didn't think it was that great, but everyone else LOVED it. The mojito pitchers were good, I didn't know the sangria was that good or else I would have tried that! My fav was the filet mignon sliders.... yum. They have dessert too, but nothing too memorable.   The service was ok, the place gets pretty loud and crowded, but for a big party, it wasn't so bad.
4	This place is crowded not just on a Friday night as other reviewers have stated, but also on a Sunday afternoon!  Some local friends wanted to take us off-strip, and I'm glad they picked Firefly.  The food was good (loved the tuna ceviche) and so was the sangria.  While we were there, a small R&B band started playing, and it wasn't long before people got up to dance.  Very diverse crowd, everyone having fun and enjoying the food and music.
3	This was a good place - to get off the strip and do something different in Vegas. I can't rave about any of the tapas. They were all fine, but nothing really great. The filet mignon sliders came highly reccomended - I am not sure why. Overcooked hamburger was what I tasted, not a great deal of seasoning. I wanted more - of something else. And I never really got it.  The sangria was good as well - but nothing exceptional. So the bill was reasonable - that was nice. But this place could be so much better - better food, nicer staff. Give it a try, maybe it was a bad night to be there. Oh and PS - there were tons of cougars there. Tons.
5	This place is definitely one of the best local favorites in Vegas.  No longer a secret, be sure to make reservations or show up 2 hours before you expect to sit and eat.  Usually I think tapas places are a rip off, but this place had delicious items for decent prices.  AND the service was great too.  I made reservations for a group of about 12, was able to push the reservation later on that same day, and my friends were seated 15 minutes early.  Even though the place was semi-crowded, we werent waiting forever for our drinks or food.highlights of the menu:crispy duck rolls, bacon-wrapped dates, ahi tuna skewers, and pretty much everything else.major plus for affordable pitchers of mojitos and sangrias.  DEFINITLEY a MUST DO whenever you are in VEGAS.
5	The always busy Firefly has been the site of many dinners over the years. Firefly is always packed and I have never had a bad meal here. Is there better tapas in the world? Yes, of course there is, however for atmosphere, service, location, and consistency this place gets five stars. The crazy thing is that it is reasonably priced as well!! Make a reservation for dinner here and you will simply not be disappointed no matter what the day or time. Go late at night and a DJ is usually playing, and the scene gets just a little prettier
3	Though I'm glad I finally tried this place, I'm not going to be rushing back here. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was super busy and super loud. Not bad if you're looking for a place to hang with a group of 4 or more, but don't expect a cozy dinner for 2.The one dish I feel is worth mentioning is the stuffed dates with blue cheese and bacon. This is the one dish I'd recommend and order again. The sangria was a little to effervescent for my taste and I think it could use a little more spice. It was pretty weak so don't expect to get a good buzz off of it.The atmosphere was lively and I'd recommend this place to you if you're looking for a young crowd. The service was decent and the food was too. It's just that nothing stood out to me about this place that I would come back here knowing there's tons of other places to try in Vegas.
4	Make reservations make reservations make reservations.  Then order a pitcher of sangria and order away.  Food is good and it's very busy.  Could be cozy and a great hang out with friends after a day of gambling.
4	What a fun little place to visit with your friends for a few hours in the evening!  On Fridays it is hopping with clientele ranging from the casually dressed to the dressed-to-the-nines.  The sangria is good and I had a tasty mojito the last time I was there. The tapas are delicious and service is generally good-  I have no complaints about Firefly and would love to come back.  The one complaint I do have is not about Firefly but about the parking- be prepared to drive around in circles for a bit if you want to park in the too-small private parking lot serving the plaza.
5	I've never ventured off the south end of the Strip to eat before (how sad is that?), but after finding this place, I'm so glad I did! I'm dying to go back to Vegas, just so I can go here again. It's reasonably priced, the tapas are all delicious (I can't think of a single thing we didn't like) and the mojitos are very tasty.Make a reservation, though! It's pretty busy.
4	My date and I checked this place out on a late Wednesday night.  I'm new to tapas but she wasn't.  We both enjoyed this place though I have to say it was way too cool for a self-professed nerd.  The clientele varied, but more and more club-bound groups came in as the night grew later.For the amount of food we ate (2 sangria, 7 dishes including paella) our bill came out to a very reasonable $60 without tip.  The hostess was polite and the wait staff was one of the most attentive and efficient crew I've ever seen. Even they looked like they enjoyed working the place.Take a cab to Firefly as the restaurant shares a strip mall with it's sister restaurant Dragonfly and a Ruth Chris's.  Parking is crowded.  Don't worry about finding a cab to your next destination; with the number of restaurants in the immediate area there are always two or three cabbies idling in the lot.
3	I had bookmarked this place for a while now after seeing Rachel Ray feature it on her $40 a day. We didn't manage to eat here on our last trip, so this time around, we decided to try and get in there on our first night in Vegas. We didn't make a reservation and it was around 7.30pm when we got there. Even though it was a Monday night, they looked pretty packed, but then again, where isn't it packed in Vegas every single night of the week?Luckily they had a table for us. Before we even ordered, a plate of complimentary appetizers were placed on the table... olives, toasted slices of baguette and some balls of either cheese or flavored butter - I couldn't tell what it was really.Hubby ordered sangria ($6). ACK, it was awful and tasted like they used cheap wine in it. I stuck with iced tea. After we ordered, the food arrived rather quickly. Boquerones ($5) on toast was okay. The marinated anchovies weren't the best I'd ever had, but we hadn't had boquerones for a long time now so we really felt like some. Really awesome bocquerones has no trace of fishiness, but these ones did have a slight fishy taste to it.Fried calamari was also okay. It was pretty good although again a little too much batter to my liking. But it wasn't rubbery so that was a plus. The camarones al ajillo was not bad, but hubby said I could've easily made that dish at home so it wasn't anything which blew him away.The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were pretty disgusting in my book. The rolls were like egg rolls but stuffed with duck. It had WAY too much hoisin sauce making them just TOO TOO sweet. It actually made my mouth pucker from just one bite. I did not like these at all. The last tapa we ordered were the lamb chops which were served with a red wine reduction. This was clearly the star of the evening. Perfectly grilled with the sauce enhancing the lamb chops instead of throwing the entire dish off like the hoisin sauce on the duck rolls. It was served on a very flavorful bed of lentils, zucchini spaghetti strands and artichokes. I would definitely order this dish again.5 tapa, 1 glass of sangria, an iced tea and one lemonade came to slightly under $55 before tip. Kinda pricey if you ask me. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. Now that I've eaten here, I don't think I'll come back again on a future trip. There are just way too many great restaurants in Vegas to return to Firefly. Food was mediocre, but I think if you are in Vegas partying, this place has great atmosphere and is good for downing alcohol and having a small bite to eat. However, we aren't the partying type even if lil guy wasn't in tow. All we want is awesome food at reasonable prices (or even awesome food at not so reasonable prices) and Firefly certainly doesn't fall into that category.
4	1.   Start with Las Vegas2.  Add 3 hot Asian chicks3.  Stir in a huge pitcher of Mojito at Firefly on Paradise4.  End result is a one happy ass Latino man and the best tapas he's had to date.
5	Great Sangria, red and white, but I personally prefer the red. Everything is in the style of tapas, but is ethnic infusion of all kinds. Everything is good, but my favorite dishes are the  Baked Brie, Mushroom Tart, Gazpacho, and the fries. Okay, but they're not just fries. They're heaven in a bowl with shredded parmesan and awesome dipping sauce. I'm kind of a fry connoisseur, by the way. One dish that I wasn't too hot on was the tuna tartar. If I want raw fish, I'm gonna go to a sushi joint. The service is kinda slow sometimes. Well, the wait staff is sometimes slow, but the kitchen is fast. I go with my bf and we order two rounds of three dishes per round. Go with more people and order at least three rounds. Once the food starts coming, it never stops. Its a little pricey, but you can order small or you can order large. Just don't go after you've smoked a blunt. We always take out-of-towners here to entertain. It always earns points. I don't recommend this place for a date during prime time as it can get really crowded and loud.* off the strip (just barey), non-casino
3	So I came here again for my birthday for the 2nd year in a row.  I've been here other days, but I just happened to come here again for some reason on my birthday.  The group ordered a lot of food, and we split it amongst ourselves.  We ordered ceviche of shrimp, firefly fries, spicy beef salad, stuffed dates, albondigas, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls, empanadas, baby back ribs, firefly fish sticks, big bowl pasta, baked brie, caramel flan, and chocolate "tres leches" cake.  They also gave us patatas bravas because they kept bringing it out to us even though we didn't order it.   Yes, that's a lot of food.Now my first time eating here, it was pleasant and all the food was delicious.  This time, only partially good.  The service was lacking although I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it's Labor Day weekend.  The fish sticks looked burned and it tasted like it too.  The free patatas bravas were charred to a black crisp, no wonder they gave those away.  They would also keep bringing us this ahi tuna skewers that we didn't order.  The crispy duck rolls were very sweet, and other than that, didn't have much flavor.  I didn't try the bowl of pasta, but there wasn't much rave about it.  People said it tastes just like any other pasta you would get anywhere.  The rest of the food was delicious though.  The Spicy Beef Salad and the stuffed dates were very good along with the baby back ribs.  I'd recommend going here on a less busy day otherwise it's too hectic, and you might get no service around here.
4	Liked the mojitos!  The pitchers were inexpensive and the food was pretty good.  I think the thai beef salad was my favorite.  If you can, get here in a cab that has a boom box.  Adds to the experience.
5	Oh man, I loved the Paella, oh god!  So many yummy flavors, good god!And these little cheesy curd like things, scrumptious!This is one of the cooler, tastiest Tapas bar I've been too :)
5	Mojitos + Tapas + Vegas + some more Mojitos = A Darn Good Time!!!They make the best mojitos--in bulk! That was the first thing we ordered when we sat down--a pitcher of "paradise" mojito please! And 4 infused vodka shots!!! That's how we started out the evening!What else did we order? More mojitos! And of course, tapas!Sausage Plate--ummm..not spectacularTuna Tartare--this was tasty too!Ceviche of shrimp--more flavorful than Wynn's!Stuffed dates--interesting! 1st time trying this one.Mushroom tart--yum!!Baked BrieTerra y Mare skewersChicken + Chorizo stuffed mushroomPaella--very good--no uncooked rice here!We are definitely coming back the next times we're here. We left with 4 happy tummies and 4 happy smiles on our face...happily ever after!
3	You should definitely come here with a group of people so you can order a variety of stuff.  It was just the two of us so we weren't able to try a whole lot.  I think we were expecting it to be a lot better based on all the good reviews but it was just mediocre for us.  I was disappointed that they were out of the Nutella sandwiches that I was looking forward to.  Anyway, we'll have to come here again with more people.
5	OK, forget the food, five stars for the hot waiter!  (see pic-doesn't do him justice).No seriously, the food was awesome!  We started off with a pitcher of mojitos, mmmmmm....   Unremarkable were the Patatas bravas [roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli].  I could make better at home.   Much better was the Mushroom tart [puff pastry, boursin cheese] and the Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  My three favorite dishes were the Stuffed Peppers [Spanish red peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce], Empanadas [pastry stuffed w/roast pork & red pepper, w/salad, aioli], and the Stuffed dates [bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese].   Make sure you get a spoon or more bread to sop up this sauce.  It is devine!  I will get those three with some new items the next time I go back... I just wish I could go this weekend!  Oh, I almost forgot.  They bring a plate with bread and olives with this yummy butter... our waiter said it was butter with almond, honey and a touch of garlic. yummy...  we also got a complimentary flan which was delish.The restaurant is dark and very cozy... my chair was touching my neighbors and it was difficult to get up to go to the ladies room.  Only complaint I have, and not even really a complaint.
4	For my Th30th birthday, I celebrated it at Firefly on Paradise Rd.  How should I start?  I found out about this place through my cousin who spent his birthday here last year.  I was very attracted to the laid back and casual setting of the place.  It looks like a bar on the outside so you wouldn't know if it was a place that you can sit down and have a meal in.  When entering the restaurant, on the right there are hostesses to greet you and ask for the reservation name.  When a table was ready for my party of 9, we are led through a crowded looking room and retro design artwork on the wall.  It was a little difficult to maneuver your body through the tight squeeze between each chair and table.  Finally managing not to knock anyone food or glasses, I finally sat down and  was able to relax.Being my favorite drink there was the Mojito, they were happy to serve it to me a few minutes after ordering it.  We dug straight in to the tapa's menu.  I had a craving for Tomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich.  Nothing worth saying about that.  It's just your regular grilled cheese dipped in tomato based soup.  We also ordered the Firefly Fries mixed with Parmesan, herbs and aioli.  I liked these fries.  It wasn't too cruncy and not soggy.  My favorite dish in the whole restaurant is the Paella.  It's a dish containing saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage.  All mixed together made my mouth feel like it was partying.  I know a little over dramatic.  But, it's the only way I can describe how good it tasted.The service was okay.  I think our server was getting mad at us because our party was always unsure of what to order.  I really didn't care since it was a day of celebration.  He had to constantly come back to check if we were ready.  We all ordered at our own pace.  I would go back just for an evening out to drink and get drunk.  It's a fun atmosphere and always seem joyous.  I've never seen any fights there or any drama going on.  They're definitely headed in the right direction.Update:  10/20/2007My bestfriend, Alisa, decided to have her 3rd 30th birthday here.  Reservation was for 7pm so we didn' t have to wait for a seat.  Good thing coz I wasn't about to wait in the cold outside with the wind blowing all over the place.  After being seated, a sangria was waiting for me to be sipped and eventually gulped, and a menu to stare at until I was ready to order.  What's good here?*  Firefly*fries [parmesan, herbs, aioli] *  Shrimp tempura  [beer-battered, ponzu dipping sauce]*  Paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage] *  SANGRIA* [marinated 3 days for maximum enjoyment]*   MOJITOS* [lime, fresh mint, rum cocktail] *  Terra y Mare skewers  [grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]*  Smoked salmon toasts  [brioche toast, sour cream, pickled ginger, capers] *  Warm spinach salad  [artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta] Service this time was great and I can't complain with her efficiency.What I thought was mediocre.*  Tomato soup  [mini grilled brie sandwich] *  Crispy duck rolls [cherry hoisin sauce]*  Babyback ribs [steamed, mango BBQ sauce]*  Filet mignon sliders  [mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions] I still would go back over and over again for the atmosphere.  I always have fun here.
5	this is my other off the strip find that i must frequent every time i'm in vegas.  i didn't realize this place is so well publicized.  i am a big sucker for deals, and they have the best happy hours!  i think they give you a complimentary plate of tapas during happy hours.  certain drinks, half off.  pitchers of sangrais and mojitos are not to be missed.  they have red and white sangria made fresh with tons of fruits as well as flavored mojitos.  the bartenders are really friendly and have sent free dessert my way every time!  bacon wrapped dates-so yummy!!  agreed that there is usually a couple of big groups of silicone filled girls drinking it up.  such a deal!!  i've had better tapas, but this is the best value for what you're getting.  oh, i love the tomato soup too!
4	Funky strip mall like location but great food. Got some free drinks, I was stoked. Great tapas to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a buffet it will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great tapas!
3	the atmosphere is really nice, the music's good, and the service does fairly well.it's too bad the food doesn't taste better. there's actually none of it that is really poor, but there's none of it that's very good either.
4	Those damn dates wrapped in bacon....the overpriced empanadas I still can't enough of....the pitchers of mojitos where the 3rd one manages to taste better than the 1st.  I really enjoy this place.  Great for groups and I like the food goddamit!
5	I found this restaurant on OpenTable.com and then looked at the Yelp reviews to verify. I made a late reservation after seeing Zumanity at NYNY.   We took a short cab ride over, and our driver verified we had made a great choice for dinner. The outside seating was pretty bare because it was cold, but once we stepped inside it was packed. I was glad I had made a reservation becuase we were seated right away. We ordered the red sangria.....excellent. A little on the sweet side, but very good. The service was very fast, and they brought out each tapa as soon as it was done, so our food was hot.We ordered: manchego mac n cheese, patatas bravas, chicken skewers, and mini sirloin burgers. Everything was great, and the patatas bravas were really spicy . I have had them at other tapas restaurants, but these were the best. The mac and cheese was also excellent. Everything we had, we would order again. The menu is very reasonable. I look forward to going back again next time I'm in Vegas. We had a wonderful meal and I highly recomment it.
5	bomb!! the tapas are creative and delicious! like the warm spinach salad with pine nuts and feta, and the mushroom tart, and the manchego mac n cheese! the service is great, portions are perfect, good atmosphere, and i cant really complain about the prices. but the reason this place gets its fifth star is bc of the banana-nutella sandwiches with warm nutella cream dipping sauce for dessert!!! need i say more??
4	I visited friends in Vegas in June, and they brought me here.  I can't thank them enough.  I had previously never had tapas (a huge oversight on my part) and really enjoyed them.  The dishes that stand out in my memory are:- Tortilla a la espanola (served hot, which was new for me, I'm used to it room temperature or cold, but it was very good)- Mushroom tart (delicious, but I'm a sucker for puff pastry and mushrooms)- Artichoke toasts (refreshing and tasty)It was very crowded, but we were willing to sit outside, even though it was at least in the 90s out there.  I wouldn't recommend taking many out of town guests into the heat of the Vegas night, but I was visiting from Texas, and it's both hot and humid there, so the dry heat was fine.As previously noted, the parking lot is somewhat dangerous and busy but the food was worth taking the risk.  This is a good choice if you have a mixed group of vegetarians/meat eaters, as there's a little something for everyone.
5	I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Firefly was a really great restaurant with a nice ambience, friendly waiters, and yummy food.  Reservations are highly recommended if you have a big party.  We came as a party of 7 and we were seated on time with our reservation (waiting for 30 minutes after reservation time is one of my pet peeves).  We were worried about the portion sizes because most tapas are really really small.  But we were pleasantly surprised because each plate was large enough for all 7 of us to try and then go for seconds!  4.5 stars for:*friendly staff*clean bathrooms*large portions*excellent presenation of food*food came out FAST*nice variety of foodsminus .5 star for their weak sangria... it was very watered down and i've had much better at other restaurants.  Other than that, I think i'll make this restaurant a regular dining experience everytime i come to vegas!
5	Cool spot. Good vibe and buzz. Try the mojito and some tapas. Dig the make shift dance floor and the paintings on the wall. Its a "to see and be seen" kinda spot, but its not stuffy like some places I've been Hmmm...Japengo - La Jolla. Ha! These cats own Dragonfly next door, if you are in the mood for Asian grub and can't stand the waits. Yup.
4	I adore tapas and am thankful Firefly is in Vegas because the only other tapas plus in town sucks. But...Firefly can be really uneven. When it's good, it's wonderful. When it's not good....it's pretty stinky. Best thing on the menu...stuffed dates! The sweet of the dates and the salty smoky flavor of bacon and the sharp pungent taste of blue cheese is a smash hit!Other favorites are the tuna tartare, ceviche, terra y mare skewers (shrimp, beef, and chorizo)Worst on the menu? The spicy beef salad is supposed to be Thai food (which really doesn't belong on a tapas menu anyway) and might be one of the nastier things I've ever tasted. The roasted eggplant canneloni is bland, but at least it's edible. I'd say about the same for the duck rolls.When  this place is good, it can achieve awesome...but be careful of what you order. I give it 4 stars because if you know your way around the menu, you can have a great meal here.
4	Firefly is supurb.Excellent atmosphere with the soft red lighting and a great painting on the back wall - loved it.Excellent service, very attentive waiters.Had to try the red sangria drenched with fruit to go along with the bread and olive plate - very, very nice.I ordered the meatballs, the stuffed red peppers with manchengo cheese and the ham croquettas. A very satisfying mealI love Tapas.I got to savor Tapas in Madrid, going to the "avenue of Tapas" after viewing a bullfight in the Plaza de Toros. It was such a great experience - walking into the bar - picking up a plate - selecting the pieces of food you wanted as you walked along the counter and then showing it to the cashier at the end and paying what ever they thought was correct. Enjoying the food with a cold drink.I was not sure that experience could be duplicated - but Firefly sure gives it outstanding effort.There are so many tempting items on the menu that it makes you want to return for sure. I have already staked out the Filet skewers with mushroom and the Filet sliders for the next visit.Oh yea - the shots of berry infused Vodka don't hurt your enjoyment one bit.
5	If you've never experienced Spanish Tapas in your life, then visiting Firefly on Paradise needs to be on your list of places to eat before you die. The food at Firefly is quite delicious and I personally recommend the stuffed dates, the lamb, and the croquettas. I know I had more favorites than what I listed but those are the only things on my mind that come to mind. But TRUST, a lot of the items are really great and the staff is very friendly!Also, it's a must that you order a pitcher of sangria and/or a pitcher of mojitos. I normally don't prefer mojitos because I see mint as being more a condiment or a flavor rather than being in your drink, but for some reason, the mojitos at Firefly are really, really tasty. I can't wait to come back and try new items on the menu! This place is definitely a great spot to go to if you're in a big group because the atmosphere is loud, the lights are dim, and since it's pretty loud inside, you might as well be loud and drunk with your friends. Why? ....well, why not?
3	Not much in the way of vegan items but if you are ready to cheat, well, this is the place to go!!!  Not cheap but not awful either.  Most of the veg tapas are 4 or 5 buxx.  Huge pitcher-sized pitcher of sangria, $24.   I don't know, this is the kind of place you see everywhere in Dallas.  Go there with your slutty-ass Wet Seal girlfriend.More importantly it has generated the worst gas storm I've had in recent memory.  You should be happy you're not in the room with me.  It might just be all the $1.50 Miller Lites I had yesterday at Bill's but Firefly certainly didn't help, or hurt, or whatever.
5	So ever since my friend took me to this local joint, I've been HOOKED. I have made sure to have dinner and drinks there each and every time I'm in Vegas since that inaugural visit. Everyone else who I take there loves it as well.The ambiance is great -- totally chill and unpretentious but there are lots of cute locals at the bar for eye candy. ;)  Things that I ALWAYS order when I'm there, a pitcher or two of sangria - both red and white are good, the bacon-wrapped dates, patatas bravas, cerviche of shrimp, camarones a la diablo - I'm kinda big on seafood stuff! But everything is pretty good. The paella helps for those who need MORE food for their bellies.
5	All the yelp.com reviews are spot on!  Really a fun place with great tasting tapas!Party of 10 this past Friday, seated immediately as we arrived at 7:50 for our 8pm reservation.I called to book a reservation, no problem.  They even responded to an email confirming!We had a great time!  Fun crowd, great waiter.Great selection of tapas for our entire group - something for everyone and no one complained about one selection!   Pitchers of sangria and mojitos were good.I'll definitely go back when in Vegas next time!
5	Love. My husband and I were trying to keep our Vegas budget on the low side, but it seems all the best places would break the bank. When I found Firefly on yelp I was pretty jazzed and I was not dissapointed. It's kind of pricey to get to if you are carless (we paid about $15 to get there from Manadaly Bay) but I suppose that's vegas for you. Seriously, your cabs are expensive! I could have gotten from the Sears Tower to Wrigleyfield in Chicago for that price! ....anyways....It was worth it - fun atrmosphere, excellent food, service was great and we got full and tipsy for under $80.We shared a pitcher of red sangira ($24), the ham and cheese croquettas (mmm), the mini filet sliders (awesome!), the veggie empanadas (okay) and the duck eggrolls (all duck and damn tasty). For dessert my hubs had the flan which was really good and I had the chocolate tres leches cake. Um, I've never had anything so good in my life. I shit you not. Never. And I eat. Look at my picture - this girl has had a few desserts in her life. This was, if not the best, maybe number two. It was that good. Next time I am in Vegas, I will definately be coming back to Firefly and getting more of that cake!
5	Ok true story...I drove all the way to LV (from the OC) w/ my girlfriendsto eat here.  This place is AMAZING!!!!  Every time I'm in town I have to stop by here & grab something to eat.  Whether it's the manchego mac & cheese, filet mignon sliders, stuffed mushrooms, steak & mushroom skewers, seared ahi skewers, etc....I just gotta have something!  Their sangria's awesome too & their mojitos are muy excellente!The prices are fair, the music is great, & the food...well it's just so damn good you'd be a fool not to try it.
5	Once again Yelp was right! We went to Firefly the first night we got to Vegas. Didn't have a reservation but got a table in less than 10mins. First we sat at the bar and ordered the Mango Mojito. I finally found a place that has really good Mango Mojitos that's comparable to the ones I had in Miami, FL. I wish I could order the jug, but that would be way too much for just me and my partnerHere is what we ordered:Bacon wrapped datesMushroom tartsSpicy beef saladHam and cheese croquettesRoasted Chicken with fries (entree)And we received complementary toasts with olives and butter type aioli (I think that's what it was). Well whatever the spread was it was so good! So tasty! I slathered my toasts with it.Wow, everything we ordered tasted so good! The mushroom tarts were huge! I was imagining small tartlets made in mini muffin tins, but instead was 2 large triangle puff pastry with creamy mushroom sauce over it. So filling! The roasted chicken, was half a chicken!!! and it was ONLY $14. The portion size was very generous. Total bill, about $50 for 2, tax and tip included, minus the mojitos, since they were paid at the bar and I forgot how much they costs, $7 each I think? Would definately recommend the place! Like others have said, nice place to go as a group, but also nice place to eat for two.
4	The Girl and I went to Vegas two weekends ago for a little getaway.  We were going to go to Maggiano's, but a college friend that lives in Henderson recommended this place.  We went with him and his fiancee late Thursday evening.  We were FAMISHED as it was nearly 9pm when we finally started ordering.  As any place in Vegas, it's loud and crowded, so that can't go against them.  It's very dark inside and crowded, but I was digging the atmosphere and the meal was a perfect start to our 48-hour trip.The four of us ordered TWELVE tapas.  My friend and fiancee had been there twice before so they already have some favorites.  We decided the best thing to do was to each order 3 things.  The Girl and I hadn't eaten for 9 hours and had to run around packing, driving, flying, cabbing, shuttling, checking in so it was a good thing we got so much food.  I was the only one who ordered alcohol (a red sangria, which was pretty good.So in no particular order, here are the dished and the two desserts with individual ratings.   See my photos for each dish.01) Spicy Beef Salad. Seared beef, warm dressing, romaine, tomato, cucumber, ginger.  Decent but not memorable. [3/5]02) Patatas bravas. Roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli.  Fantastic.  Crispy and tasty even without the aioli.  [5/5]03) Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Very good.  [4/5]04) Stuffed dates.  Bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  These were just ... WOW.  [5/5]05) Steak and mushroom skewers.  grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction.  Good but it sounded better than it was.  [3/5]06) Manchego mac 'n' cheese.  Excellent.  Almost as good as the mac n' cheese w/ truffle oil at Alexander's.  [4/5]07) Baked brie.  roasted tomato and cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts.  Pretty good but a little lacking quantity-wise.  [3/5]08) Roasted eggplant cannelloni.  goat cheese, tomato sauce.  The Girl loves eggplant and this sounded good, but the execution was a bit disappointing.  [3/5]09) Babyback ribs.  steamed, mango BBQ sauce.  Delicious!  [4/5]10) Baked Filets of grouper.  marinated with herbs, lemon, garlic.  Actually pretty good for grouper, and a refreshing change of pace from all the strong flavors.  [4/5]11) Ahi tuna skewer.  mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze.  Not really that memorable.  [3/5]12) Petite filet.  mini filet mignon, herb cheese, roasted red potato and mushrooms, red wine sauce.  Wasn't sure if this was actually filet, but very good, very tender.  [4/5]13) Chocolate and cherry bread pudding.  warm w/port wine reduction.  Not usually a bread pudding fan but it was good.  [3/5]14) Chocolate "Tres Leches" Cake.  Forgot how spongy and sweet (thanks to condensed milk) this is, but once I got the hang of it I was sucking it down.  [4/5] Overall, the meal was excellent.  And all that food came to only about $37/person.  Exceptional for Vegas!  I recommended the place to another friend who went this weekend and she really liked it as well.  I'm definitely coming here again.  Firefly is a solid 4 stars!
5	I've had great tapas before but it's 5 star worthy. When you're beat from paying high-priced strip food, this is where the locals go. Maybe Rachel Ray messed it up by telling us non-Vegas locas about this in $40-a day. The price is right, the menu is damn good, and the assortment of sangria and especially mojito is endless. My next trip to Vegas I will have to stop here for a bite.
3	Small plates are one of my favorite ways to dine and I've been fortunate to have great tapas/small plates in different parts of the country.  After reading all the reviews on Firefly, we were all geared up for good drinks and grub!  The place, in a strip mall, had a great vibe.  Their was a large group of people next to us and we liked the fun and friendly vibe of the place.  The menu was great, lots of selections, and we enjoyed a decent pitcher of mojitos waiting eagerly for our tapas.  At the waiter's recommendation, my hubbie and I ordered the beaf/ shrimp/ chourizo skewers (very good); stuffed red Spanish peppers (okay but strangely chewy cheese in center--not cooked enough?); calamari (too, too salty--skip it!); cherry crispy duck rolls (dry--skip it); and spinach salad (very good).  But the desserts reigned supreme--the housemade gelato and chocolate tres leche cake is what earned this restaurant three stars.  Considering it's in Las Vegas, the value for the money is good but the quality is only okay, and overall, wouldn't go back considering location off strip and the $15 taxi ride each way from Paris.
5	What a lucky find. I was planning a birthday dinner for a friend and was referred to firefly by a local homeslice. First off the place is a non casino off the strip type joint, so that was a major plus in my book. The place was small, and intimate and allowed you to socialize with friends. The wait staff was excellent, the food was awsome - but a little slow coming even though the place was not to busy. All in all, this is now one of my favorite places for eats and drinks!
2	Maybe I was just in a bad mood and am being a bit harsh because my iPhone had *just* been stolen right before we headed here but I just was not thrilled with Firefly in the least.The sangria was okay but not great. The food was so greasy it was gross. The mini little burgers were the best thing and they weren't even all that. I felt like I needed to do a cleanse after I left..and a facial! Too much grease...ugh I so won't be returning :(
4	My friends threw me a small party here to start my 21st birthday!!! It's usually busy, I love the music, setting and mood. I like the mix diverse crowd, I also went on a date here and it was a quiet night so it was perfect. Great to bring friends visiting out of town because of the food too, and if you're a TOURIST check it out!!!!! very Latin Influenced FYI
4	Wow, that's some good stuff. Went to a trip to Vegas recently, and didn't feel like spending $60 per person eating on the strip so we went to Firefly for some Tapas. The stuffed dates had an interesting taste. Interesting good. Sweet dates, salty bacon, crunchy nuts. Very nice texture. The meat empanada was spectacular. It's a small empanada, but cooked very nice and had a cream sauce that went well. We had a mushroom dish that was basically mushrooms with a creamy sauce on top of a pastry. Good and pretty filling as well.Fried calamari - yum! Tentacles were better than the rings. Sangria was pretty good. Might not be the best, but certainly not the worst. Lunch for two was just over $40, but we only had one glass of sangria, so if you're a drinker, it'll cost a bit more. This is a place I'll visit again if I go to Vegas again. Nice to know you don't have to spend alot to get a nice, "different" meal not too far from The Strip.
5	Disclaimer:  Please keep in mind that my experience at this spot came after about 6 beers.  This spot came as a recommendation from a coworker who the Melon and I was with on a business trip.  We walked in and the wait staff was immediately warm and had us seated instantly.  It probably didn't hurt that my man Javier spoke Spanish to them and is an all around funny guy, he had them cracking up the entire dinner.  The manager came over and instantly had us a jug of Sangria on the table.  He didn't even ask us what we wanted, he just asked if we were ok with his suggestions.   I can't tell you what exactly was on the menu, or what exactly was ordered.  It just came.     I do know that I ate lamb, (I hate lamb) and it was tender and delicious.  I also remember having some ceviche that knocked my socks off.  Singles:  This is absolutely the place to be.  Hotties left and right.  We were stumbling out of here around midnight-thirty and they were still rolling in!  This place is just a mile or 2 off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth the cab fare.
5	This is the second time that I have come here and I love it!! First time was during lunch time and this time for dinner for 11 girls for my bachelorette!Please order the  mojitos when you go there. Just the regular one or the mango one. The raspberry one was just "eh".  Order a pitcher, cuz you get more for your money and trust me, you will want more than one mojito!!Food came out fast and fresh, but my stomach was going through some trauma after a full night of drinking, fat tuesdays, and denny's @ 5am, that I just had no appetite. Only the mojitos and few bites of whatever kept me sane.Just off the strip and a short cab ride and you will be in Tapas heaven!
5	Best Tapas and Mojitos @ this restaurant!! I wish they had one in the bay area. I now try to make it a point to come by here when visiting. On this trip we came here for Maritel C's bachlorette dinner. They accommodated our large party of gals and we had great service. The food came out pretty quick...a star for that and 4 more stars for the drinks!!! Yummy!! Can't go wrong with a mojito, mango mojito, or some sangria!! Best thing to do is come here with a group of people and order different tapas to sample them all....then pick your favorites! Tapas + Drinks = 5stars for this place!
5	Thank you Javier for directing us to this off-strip Tapas place. The sangria was dangerously delicious.  Don't go there thirsty as you'll suck down a glass only to realize that woops, there is alcohol mixed in with the fruity goodness.I don't recall all the tapas we ordered but let's just say that as someone who HATES lamb...I would not only eat, but order lamb at this place.  Yum.   We ordered:Tortilla de Papa CevicheFilet SkewersSome kinda bacon wrapped in almond thing that was like a thousand mini foodgasms in my mouth.Oh and be sure to try their flavor infused vodka shots..YUMMY!
4	We found this place off the strip, and it was a great find.  More reasonably priced than Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, but I'm sure their location has a lot to do with that.  The ahi tuna skewers were good, caamarones a la diabla are nice and spicy, and of course I had to have dessert... the caramel flan was perfectly creamy and tasty.  I wasn't a big fan of the crispy duck rolls... duck is already oily and this fried roll was way too much for me.
5	made a reservation on Valentines day @ midnight (they're open late which is very awesome) crowded but had our table ready, parking is not great  so arrive early if you have reservations, good place for groups since you can all try a little of everything, we ordered the pitcher of red sangria ($24) which was not bad, but for our second pitcher we tried the passion fruit mojito ($30) which I really liked.  Total bill for 5 people $142-not bad considering 2 pitchers of booze, 10 different types of tapas, and 3 desserts. ** recommend the mushroom tart, stuffed dates because everyone else yelped about those so I had to see for myself, banana nutella sandwiches because face it...Nutella is good with anything and the choc tres leches cake.  I will definitely be back!**reservations booked through opentable.com
4	I went here with a bunch of co-workers last week.  The food was really good and the service was great.  It was fun to order about 30 different things off the menu and try everything.  The stuffed dates are probably the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Yeah, you're probably thinking the same thing I was - "what the hell is a date and why is she stuffed"...but trust me, worth trying (a few).It was really crowded and loud.  I wouldn't suggest going here unless you are in a group of 6-8+.  The parking lot of horrible, but it is shared with about five other places...it's Vegas, what did you expect.
5	This place is kickass. Their RED sangria is to DIE for...always make sure to order a pitcher to go with your tapas. I don't think I've ever had a bad dish here. Among the things I've tried are: the baked brie, duck spring rolls, veggie empanadas, french fries (with a delicious dipping sauce), chicken skewers, and many others I can't remember! The prices are pretty affordable too...the only thing that is semi-pricey is the sangria, but that's a small price to pay for your meal. The desserts are also really good. I've had their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate cake thingie...both delicious. The only downside to this place is the CRAMPED parking area...most times if you're going at a peak hour (Fri or Sat nights), you'll have to park in the back...but it's not that big of a deal. Try to sit outside if you can during the spring/summer weather, it makes the meal even better. I've had a party of 10 inside for my bday, and that worked out well, too.
4	Solid tapas place just outside of the Las Vegas Blvd insanity.
4	Spacious casual or pre or post club place on Paradise, so convenient for clubbing. I enjoyed the tapas, but half of them tended to lean towards the quality of Applebee's type dishes. I really liked the huge open windows and the vibrant young crowd, the air felt full of pre-game excitement of Vegas partying. I had a couple of beautiful glasses of red wine, pretty fantastic wine choices considering the not so great quality of the food.I have to say, that this place would come in handy if you are drunk off your gourd and needed some heavy friend food to dissipate the feeling. Highly recommended.
5	Nothing but a praise for those guys!Super attentive service regardless big crowd. Great waitressing staff. Very tasty food. Extremely fair prices. Fun atmosphere to be in.What else can one possibly want? Its TOTALLY worth cab ride from the strip."I Like""Very Nice"Eugene
3	A couple of friends and I went out to Firefly to celebrate the evening.  The place itself is a little dark, but decorated quite nicely. We were seated at the patio...it was enjoyable,  the weather was pleasantly beautiful.  We started with a pitcher of Sangria,  it was sweet with a strong flavor. We ordered tapas. Baked brie, patatas bravas, tortilla espanola, and calamari all were enjoyed by all. There was no room for a main entree the portions were quite big. We couldn't say no to dessert and had to have the chocolate cake in tres leches....SO GOOD rich and sweet. Service was mediocre, our waiter was lame. Not very attentive nor talkative. We asked for several things while it appeared he was just being a little lazy and he lagged.   Overall good food experience, but unpleasant service.  Don't know I would go back because of the service.I recommend reservations they get fully booked on Friday and Saturday. 4 stars, but minus 1 due to bad service.
5	Thank you fellow Yelpers for another super recommendation!!  The bf and I took a client and his wife to dinner on Monday evening.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  They have quite an extensive tapas list and the prices are ridiculous!  Ridiculously LOW that is!!We ordered 9 tapas plates - each plate had 3 items on it with the exception of the taters and the mac and cheese plate.  We also ordered 3 desserts and had 4 glasses of sangria (total, not each...geez, we aren't lushes...anymore).  Everything was delish!!!   The best part was that  the bill was just a tad over $100.  If we would have had this meal at home it would have been almost double that.There is a meat market-ish sort of vibe inside at the bar so if you are looking to pick up a piece of ass and a manchego cheese and serrano ham dish while you are at it, check Firefly out!
3	I've never been here... so rating neutral. BUT we picked this restaurant because the high Yelp rating. Called the restaurant a few weeks before hand with questions, very nice. When we arrived in Vegas called about 8 hours before hand and they said we needed a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. Why didn't they say anything beforehand. Not sure if I want to try next time?
4	Really good tapas, but go for happy hour. The bar is small, but it is an awesome place to sit and have your discounted mojitos, sangria, and tapas. The place gets very crowded and I found the best time to go is happy hour. You get great service from the bartender. You do not need to deal with the crowd or have reservations. Once you are drunk and stuffed with tapas, crawl next door to their sister restaurant Dragonfly and have some sushi. The bartender, Aaron, is awesome!
5	Probably one of the best Tapas restaurants I've been to, and the prices are really reasonable!!  I have loved everything I've had there (and I've had just about everything since I'm in Vegas 5 or 6 times a year at least).  My faves include the stuffed dates (sounds gross, but super tastey- hey, everything is better with bacon!), the duck (love duck!), empanadas (warning, they recently started skimping on them- you only get one cut in half now instead of two per order), and the patatas bravas.  There is a salad I always get too, but I don't remember which one without seeing the menu.  Everything I've had there was excellent, including the brioches and serrano ham!You can't go wrong here!  And if you like sweet drinks, they do serve a white sangria here, which is unique but very sugary.  The service varies from night to nite, but it's never been terrible, but on some nites it hasn't been so great.  I think they get overwhelmed at times at the number of people there.   The atmosphere is great, and I think they get a fair amount of locals there so it's not too Vegas-y.I think this is a necessity of any Vegas trip.
1	the WORST MEAL EVER! btw, i wrote a much more detailed review, which mysteriously disappeared.my boyfriend got food poisoning here. it ruined out trip. the food was overpriced and a JOKE. like a chain restaurant, straight out of a can. the mushroom tart was literally canned mushrooms in that sauce that comes in a can dumped over a reheated frozen triangle of pillsbury puff pastry.perhaps the owners should get out of vegas and travel to spain or at least a few spanish restaurants before claiming to serve tapas food.STAY AWAY!!!
4	Worth a trip off the strip.  Totally worth the $8 cab ride from Ceasar's. Great tapas at reasonable prices.  The food came out quick, which I thought might be a bad sign (i.e., pre-prepared food), but the food was quite good.  The best dish was the boquerones (Spanish white anchovies served on toast, with roasted red and yellow peppers).  My second favorite was the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with smoked almonds, and served with a red wine reduction and blue cheese.  The sweet and salty flavors worked really well with the almonds which gave the dish such a nice crunch.  The ceviche of tiger shrimp and avocado was delish as well--very fresh and tangy.  Unlike another reviewer, we really enjoyed the cheesy mushroom tart puff pastry.  Maybe the shrooms came out of a can, but that was one delish can.  The camarones a la diabla didnt lie--the spicy chile sauce was quite hot and yummy.  For dessert, the chocolate tres leches cake was perfect.  A lot of places really mess this dessert up, but the cake was fresh and milky and to die for.  The only thing I didnt like was the red wine sangria.  Not enough fruit and the wine tasted kinda heavy-sweet and cheap.  But there's a full bar, so you can get any other kind of drink you want.
5	I love this place!  My first indie restaurant find when I moved to Las Vegas, thanks to the Food Network.  Actually, the first time I went, I had horrible service and complained about how bad it was, but the manager comped me our next visit.  The next time the service was much better, and the food was simply delicious both times.  I've been going back ever since, and every person I bring agrees on the quality of the food.  Sangria is amazing as well -- we never go and skip at least getting one pitcher for the table.  And we're even amazed when the bill comes -- we're always stuffed (and drunk) and somehow only end up paying about $20-$25/person.
3	The best place i have found to just chill and sip sangria and eat tapas in vegas very fun with large partys . wait staff not the best but up their .
4	For my birthday my amazing boyfriend whisked me off from the cold of San Francisco to the desert warmth of Vegas.  After meticulous planning and calling in his connections he was recommenced to take me to Firefly for dinner (he knows my love of eating tiny bits of food with my hands).  The sangria was delicious and the service was polite and very swift (some of the best service we had in Vegas).  The tapas were all delicious however the one that outshined all  of them was the dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped in bacon (he also knows my love of bacon).  So delicious we ended up ordering a second round even though neither of us were hungry.  Also to everyone complaining that this place isnt authentic Spanish tapas well duh....first of all its Vegas...is there anything authentic in Vegas? Second, nowhere does Firefly claim to be authentic tapas restaurant (although 2 pitchers of Sangria in, I wasnt looking for fine print on the menu).  In fact in most of the US and Europe, tapas is its own cuisine that  doesnt necessarily pertain to Spanish cooking...look it up...no seriously...go ahead I'll wait.You back? Good,  probably about half the tapas places Ive eaten at arent anywhere near traditional Spanish food, which I am very well educated in (trust me, Im dating a mexican so yeah my word is gold...or at least gold plated). Yet, I can still enjoy tapas even when they arent made with olives from Tia's ranch.  Bottom line, good food is good food no matter what you call it, and Firefly is good food.
3	great vibe. but food could be a lot better. ordered the octopus, paella, anchovies, and sangria. paella did not have the delicious crunchy crust that it is normally associated with it. the octopus was precooked and kept too long. the octopus wasn't tender with a slight chew, it was grainy and mushy. anchovies however were perfect. salty, sour, and paired with red peppers and crunchy bread. and of course the sangria can't be beat. recommend for a group of friends or a casual date.
5	Definitely a cool place to have great food and chill with some nice, yummy mojitos! My friends and I ordered a vast array of food: Firefly Fries (fries with parmesan, herbs, aioli), Empanada (pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli), Terra y Mare skewers (grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde), and the Paella (saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage). There were only two empanadas, and the Terra y Mare had three skewers. The paella was alright, one of the better ones, since it wasn't so SALTY (like real Spanish food!). The fries were also really tasty with the lightly shredded parmesan.For drinks, you have to try their mojitos! I am a huge mojito fan, and the way they make it is so delicious! I had their mango mojito! YUM! It tasted like juice with a little kick of alcohol, and maybe a slight "sparkle" feel to it. I also tried a sip of the Raspberry mojito, and it was just as good! SO REFRESHING!For dessert, we ordered the Trio of Gelato (fresh-made toasted almond, chocolate, vanilla ice creams). YUM! The chocolate had this cocoa taste to it, and for some reason the vanilla tasted like condensed milk (Maybe when the ice creams just melted and mixed together it had that texture!) I loved how they added the ladyfinger in it too! It so complemented the chocolate ice cream! YUMMMMMM!The service was excellent. The waiter never rushed us, and always asked how things were.A great place to just relax with some buddies for a little chit chat...
1	i really don't understand the popularity of this place.  my friend and i came here for lunch and we were underwhelmed.  thought the food was subpar and the sangria had bits and pieces of fruit with the edges all brown and gross.  the only redeeming attribute was the al fresco dining and the people watching.  will not be returning
5	Thanks to Rachael Ray, we decided to check out Firefly on our week long trip to Vegas, and well... She didn't lie about the amazingness of this place.We have been trying and trying to find a place in our area that lives up to the food we had at Firefly, but I honestly don't think we're going to be able to do it.The place was packed when we got there (I think it was a Friday night), but once we started eating, we understood why.  Drinks were excellent, and the food was unbelievable.  We ended up ordering twice, because some of the things we got were so delicious. Service was great.  Our waiter was great at explaining the way the menu and ordering worked, since it was our first real tapas experience.I honestly want to fly to Vegas for a day, just so we can eat here again. :)
4	My friend and I hit this place up on a Friday evening before I went over to the Hard Rock Pool for a concert.  I've driven past this place a hundred times and it always seems packed.  This was true on a Friday night, yet when we went inside, we were seated immediately.  In fact, we were able to sit out on the patio in the cooling summer weather.  We just wanted to eat a couple of appetizers and enjoy a couple of drinks.  I ordered the patatas braza (red potatoes in a hot sauce) with the duck rolls (egg rolls but duck instead of egg).  Both were small portions, but considering we weren't that hungry, they were perfect.  The flavor of the sauce accompanying the duck was excellent.  The patatas were good but a little too spicy.My friend was craving a mojito all day and since we couldn't do some at home, she got one here.  No plain pre-made mojito here, it was full of mint leaves and left a nice aftertaste in my mouth when I was allowed a sample.We shall return here to sample a more complex menu in the future, as well as sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere and seating within (cool couches for seating instead of your regular high-back chair faire.  The cost was relatively inexpensive (as long as you don't come in too hungry), so we can come again before a Friday Night Live concert at the Hard Rock pool without feeling like a broke pig.
4	I'd give it 5 stars, but I only had a mojito and a couple bites of my friends tapas.  He ordered baby red potatoes w/ aioli sauce and spicy duck egg rolls, which were both very tasty.I loved the atmosphere and the Brazilian/Spanish music.  I can't wait to go back and try some more tapas.  This would be the perfect place to impress a date and set the right mood, without going broke!  The tapas range in price between $3-$8, so you can afford to experiment...have fun!!!
5	I'm sooo excited to be writing my first review here!Firefly on Paradise was amazing.  I went based on lots of people's reviews here and loved it.  The place was definitely packed and I was glad I had called for reservation for the party of 4.The food was great!  I had been missing Spanish food since I came back from Spain and the food here definitely hit the spot.  The boquerones were traditionally done and were delicious.  The stuffed dates are to die for and a must-have.  We even tried it without bacon since we had someone following kosher diet in our group.  The veggie empanadas were also very tasty.  Another traditional spanish dish is the patatas bravas.  They made them very much like the ones I had in Spain though I would have liked them a bit spicier.To compliment all the delicious food, we also enjoyed a couple of pitchers of sangria.  The service was good all the way through.I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!
4	Somebody please tell me what it is about Sangria that makes it go down the hatch like water??!  Firefly makes a great pitcher or three.  For six chicas heading off the strip, Firefly was certainly worth it.  Fortunately, when with a large group, you can really delve into a tapas menu.  We ordered about 15 to share. The bacon wrapped, stuffed dates and the manchego macaroni and cheese were among my favorites.  Strangely enough, the "firefly fries" with Parmesan cheese were so good that we ordered a second batch.  Some other standouts were the tierra y mar skewers, a mushroom topped fillet mignon, and shrimp with garlic sauce.I would stay away from the stuffed mushrooms, which were dry and boring, despite the menu description -  "(yum)" and the baked brie with chorizo, which just seemed like a collapsed salty mess.  The delicious meal, decent atmosphere and a price of less than $35 per person would entice me to return.
3	Mmmm . . .  I gotta say, this is good tapas and the pitcher of mojitos hit the spot. In fact, it hit the spot so well, I can't remember everything I ordered. The bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed. I also loved the mac n cheese (tasty, slightly crunchy). The pork empanadas were good too.  The duck rolls, however, were gamey (hey, it was duck), and as others noted below, the mushroom puffs were underwhelming.We ate way too many (tapas creep up on you like that). We got there around 4 pm on a Friday and there was still room at the bar (though we didn't sit at the bar). I would go for the patio since the restaurant itself is so unassuming. This is no Lotus of Siam (as a Vegas culinary experience, LOS sets the standard for me), but it's great at what it does and tasty as hell. Servers and service were excellent. And if you want to keep the fun going, and walk off those mojitos, you can walk around the corner on Twain to the friendly gay bar, the Funhog Ranch!!! I'm just saying . ..
5	Holy Tapas, Batman! I will never again eat anywhere else in Las Vegas. Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But this place knocked me off my feet. I'm in love. The food was delicious and filling, the service was great, and it was DIRT CHEAP. For ten people, the bill came to $30 a person for dinner AND drinks. And I was able to get a Red Bull Vodka for $5. That's almost unheard of in Vegas! Let me just give you a sampling of what we sampled. (This is a Tapas place, after all, so everything is small. But you just keep ordering and they keep throwing the plates at you and it's wonderful.) -Ceviche of shrimp (shrimp with avocado in a light broth)-Stuffed dates  (I usually hate dates but i LOOOOOVED these. It's dates stuffed with bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon. DROOL.)-Veggie empanada-Firefly fries (with parmesan cheese, herbs, and aioli dipping sauce)-Stuffed peppers (red bell peppers with mozarella and tomato sauce)-Baked brie (with tomato and chorizo)-Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese (DELISH; I'd never heard of Manchego cheese before but had it again the next day; it's kind of parmesan-ish)-Stuffed mushrooms (with chicken and chorizo)-Chicken skewers-Camarones al ajillo (shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce)Is your mouth watering yet? This place was fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone with taste buds.
4	Great drinks and great food. What else is there? This joint has a small patio for outside seating and has a cozy and clean interior. I wouldn't call it upscale, but it's a nice place to get away from the crazies at the casinos for tapas. The prices were pretty reasonable even for tapas. Sampled in this run: Albondigas (meatballs with a sherry sauce), Sliders (very juicy with a kick!), Big Salad, Cheese stuffed peppers, veggi empanadas and a huge pitcher of mango mojitos. We capped the meal with Cheese cake and tres leches cake. The food was filling, but I have to admit the Big Salad was big, but sort of uninspiring. It's a ceaser salad with some standard salad stuff, heart of palm etc. The peppers were great but, it's nothing to write home about, was just a pepper with cheese, maybe I didn't get enough sauce. The meatballs, sliders and empanadas were good and offered a better depth of flavor. The cheesecake was pretty standard fair and I felt the lemon sauce over powered the dish a little. The tres leches was great, even better than some I had in Mexico, it was the perfect consistency and was very sweet.This is a great spot for a meal with friends, and a great spot for drinks too! Don't forget the bar!!!
2	We went to Firefly for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty dead, so maybe that's why everything seemed a little haphazard and sloppy. We ordered all tapas: seviche, mushroom tart, smoked salmon on toast, some kind of skewer with shrimp, sausage and tenderloin, bacon-wrapped dates, and the ham & manchego croquettes, with the banana/nutella sandwich for dessert. The only things I'd order again were the dates and the croquettes (both of which were delish). Although the seviche was very tasty, it was a bad call if you have a bit of a hangover. The dessert was good, but not amazing. The rest, though, were all subpar. Apparently we should have tried the macaroni and manchego and the Firefly fries. Overall, I was not impressed, though, as the visit certainly didn't measure up to the fine opinions of my fellow Yelpers. Must have been a bad day?
4	We came back this weekend... had the artichoke toasts, they were very good.  Also had the chocolate tres leches... nothing to write home about, get the flan!
4	I was suggested this restaurant by some fellow Phoenix yelpers.  They got it right once again.  My husband and I called ahead to find out there was a 20-30 minute wait on that particular Saturday night.  We arrived and the place was jumpin'!  It gives off the vibe of a very hip and trendy spot with dim lights and loud voices.  We waited outside for 10-15 minutes watching all of the too-cool guys who tried too hard to look like they didn't try and barely 20 year old girls with dresses that barely cover.We were seated and started making some drink choices - red sangria for me (too many mentions not to!) and a diet coke for him.  I didn't care for it at first, but then like the others said, it goes down just like water.  I think next time I would try one of the mojitos.  For dinner we ordered the manchego mac n' cheese (delicious and rich), terra y mare skewers (very good), and shrimp tempura (good).  For dessert we ate the gelato trio with chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio (yum!) and lemon berry mini tarts (very tasty).  Our bill for three tapas, two desserts, two drinks, tax and tip was about $50Overall the food was tasty and had a very large selection, service was good, and atmosphere was just too loud - we almost had to yell to hear each other.  Maybe next time I would ask for seating on the patio or make reservations.  They accept reservations over the phone and online.  I will definitely be back again to try more menu items, desserts, and drinks!
2	(Jan/ 2006)We came here really late after watching "O" at the Bellagio and waited at the bar for a while before we got a table. Cheap drinks! Tip: If you need a cab to get back to your hotel after eating here late night, make sure you ask have the hostess call while you are dining. We had to wait nearly an hour for a taxi to make its way out here to get us. That was ridiculous.
4	Our dinner at Firefly happened so quickly.  It seemed like moments after we would order another dish it was at our table.  The restaurant is loud and small and very high energy.  The tapas were of a good size to split four ways and we ordered about 7 or so total.  The sangria was ok, not the best ever.  I have to say that I have had much better tapas in other cities.  While they were good and I love Spanish food, there was not a single one that stood out to me as outstanding.  I may return on another trip since its nice to get off the strip sometimes and my friends that live in Vegas don't always like going to dinner on the strip. (Not that I blame them at all)   It's a very un "Vegas" like experience and more of a "find this in any city" kind of experience.  (Just depends on what you're looking for)
5	now why would anyone go to the strip to have tapas when this place is just off the strip??? firefly is a locals' hang out. it was super crowded even at 7pm on  a Monday. who eats out on a Monday? you must have some sangria--we ordered the white--along with the sliders, the spicy shrimp, and the basket of fries (this was clearly not a tapas portion). the mac and cheese was also delicious. overall, this place is fantastic. truly.
4	Food-wise, this place isn't half bad. I love their mac and cheese and haven't really had a dish I didn't like. However, the service leaves a bit to be desired. It's partly due to the layout, I feel quite crammed in this establishment and the servers are hard to flag down once you get your order in. Nevertheless the atmosphere is nice (dim, good music) and I'd recommend this my friends, if anything for their fries. Yum!
1	This place is overly rated from a locals standpoint, for those of you out of towners that like a party scene this might be the place for you folks. This might be a place to get a quick bite before or after clubbing. The food is just so so, not great. The portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish. As for the Sangria, it's alcohol and what is there not to like about anything that's mixed with alcohol....it's so overly advertised by some of the yelpers. Been here a couple of times with friends from out of town....and can't really say...."ummm I remember that was good you gotta try it!" Don't really have a dish that you have to go back for more of. The steak skewer was dry, the mushroom with puff patry was tasteless, the Firefly Fries was soggy, if you have a big party your gonna have to order a couple of orders per dish if you want enough to go around. The music of this place is loud that you'll have to shout across the table to talk to your friends and the place is so dim that you have to be careful of what your putting into your mouth. Overall, the service was poor. The hostesses working there seems to have some kind of attitude problem...they first ask you if you have a reservation to make it seems like you should know better to make one next time ...cause we're sooooo busy!
5	i loooooove this place!!! the food is sooo tastey and good.. affordable too..  prices for tapas usually ranged from $3- $16.. the atmosphere inside is really nice although the plaza outside looks kinda boring... we had reservations so it wasnt hard to get a table.. our food came out really fast and finished our dinner within an hour..  highly recommend this place for some cheap good food!
4	I thought this place was awesome! Food was great it's off the strip had a cool lounge in the front where you could order food.  All the food was great and so was the sangria.  The prices were great and it wasn't too fancy so you didn't have to dress up. This place is a must try! Going to add some pictures of the food! Pictures really don't do this place justice
4	Firefly lived up to every review. The mojitos were amazing (mojitos are my fave and I order them everywhere), especially the Passion Fruit one, and my boyfriend ordered the house-made infused vodka on the rocks, which was also amazing, and not nearly as strong-tasting as you would think. The food was great, and the prices were even better. We sat outside and the service was slow, but it was a monday night. The music was also a bit loud, but oh well. The baby back mango-bbq ribs were awesome and literally falling off the bone. The stuffed dates were amazing, the calamari was thick-cut and delicious. The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken were good, but not great, and same goes for the salmon with brioche toasts. They were both good, but I guess just not what we were in the mood for. We will definitely be going back!
5	Fantastic food, cool non-strip atmosphere (dark, red room), and cheapie-cheap!  I have been pretty blown away all three times I've eaten here.  For the price, tapas doesn't get much better than this.You MUST try:Stuffed datesLamb chops in red-wine reduction with sauteed lentils (yummy!!!)Grilled octopus (pulpo asado)Filet mignon slidersBut everything was really tasty.  Pitchers of Sangria or Mojitos are a bargain for a group.  They're both a little too sweet for my taste, but I hardly notice since I can't be torn away from my food.  There's also a happening scene on the patio at night.
4	This place is great. Great tapas and Sangria!
4	We always try to go to Firefly at least once on our Vegas jaunts.  Reservations are a must as the place fills up with mostly the younger crowd.  I love bringing new people here to show that some Vegas places can still make awesome food for low prices.  The parking can be hit or miss when it is busy.  I haven't tried Drangonfly next door yet - next visit I guess.
5	ohmy damnthis place is amazing. my aunt lives in las vegas and everytime we go there we eat here. great place. very good vibe. the environment is adult and just is a good hang out dinner nightlife spot. the food is amazing. get the fries. the cheese fries or howver you call it. its good. no joke.
4	I go to this place a lot with friends. Blood orange mojitos. Get a pitcher if you have a cab or a DD with you. Sweet, flavorful, full of mint and not too much ice (but enough to keep it cold). Yum!I go here with my gals for nights out (and sometimes evenings out that turn into nights out... oh yeah). The service is friendly and prompt. I don't like the butter-type stuff that comes with their bread, but I love their:goat cheese cannoli (rolled in eggplant)mini-cheesecakeswarm spinach saladcampenadaslentils (my friend comes here just for that)duck egg rolls (my friend finds them spicy, but ketchup is adventurous for her)banana sandwiches with Nutella sauceUm.. can't think of more, but I know that I want to go there again just for that!We aren't as big on thier mixed salad (too oily for me) or baked brie. But out of their 50 menu items, we've tried about 35 and loved maybe 28, which is pretty good!
4	I was shocked to see the one review about poor service-- the service is actually the reason I bumped this place up one star! Maybe you have to stay away from the girls? ;D  Our one waiter and two busboys were that perfect balance of super attentive + totally on top of the refills, but without being in your face all the time.The Tapas were all pretty decent, but the Stuffed Dates, Albondigas & Camarones a la Diabla (especially THAT one!) were stand-outs IMHO. The straight up Mohito is tasty and the Passion Fruit Mini-Cheescakes were different (in a good way).Use valet if parking looks impossible...
5	Thanks to Susan, this was my 1st Spanish Tapas experience and I liked it.I drove by this local twice before I found it. I expected a bigger neon sign I guess.It is a quiet locale. There is parking but with the other businesses in this strip mall spaces fill up quick. Very crowded, popular and noisy but worth it.Cannot wait to go back. Gracias.
5	When I'm in town I always try to stay next door at the fairfield so I can walk "home" after my firefly night(s).  The Sangria - both white and red, the mojito's - blood orange and otherwise and the food is fantastic.  Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and blue cheese - wow!  Ceviche, tuna tartar, albondigas, anchovies, baked brie, the list goes on and on.  Get a reservation and enjoy yourself.  My last trip through lost wages I ate 4 nights in a row here.
3	Since I tend to frequent Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba when I want tapas, I decided to give Firefly a shot. Took my friend out to dinner for her birthday here, and wasn't disappointed, but I also was not tempted to return again.Started with the boquerones, the stuffed dates (one of my absolute favorite foods), roasted eggplant cannelloni (superb!) & the pulpo asado. We had the Paella as our entree.There's not much you can screw up on boquerones, because the restaurant buys the white anchovies already marinated; the stuffed dates were delicious, I especially liked the crunch that the marcona almond added to the soft baked date and melted blue cheese; the eggplant cannelloni was wonderful, but I thought it was an odd item to find on a tapas menu, as it resembled the Italian Eggplant Rollatini, it was almost like they were looking for items to add to the menu; the pulpo asado (grilled octopus) was disappointing - there was no char from the grill on the octopus, which is key to making this dish. It was also rubbery. The paella was an abysmal failure. It was soupy, there was no seasoning, and they really skimped on the seafood and other items. It was like a sad seafood risotto, with some saffron added to give the affect of being a paella. The service and overall atmosphere were, by far, the worst part of the experience. I had to yell across my table to make conversation with my friend, because the place is so cramped with people. Our server seemed to act like we were an inconvenience by ordering so much food, and he decided to take 30 minutes to deliver our desserts to us. I think once was enough for me, and I have recently heard that the health department shut them down for a bit, due to the same constant health violations.
4	Nice spot with "local" flavor in Las Vegas. go for drinks, for outdoor sitting, for good talks and good food.
4	Why I loved Firefly1. Awesome Tapas2. Good atmosphere3. Very reasonable for Las Vegas ($30 per person including drinks)
5	i give it 5 stars because i like ambiance. The tapas are delicious and the price is very very reasonable, the manager was very friendly and accommodating, he comped our dinner because we found a hair in our paella but it was still delicious!
3	A great "off strip" choice for dinner.  There are plenty of choices on the menu and I couldn't believe how inexpensive the food was.  The tapas were hit or miss.  Ones to avoid:  crispy duck rolls (they weren't crispy);  spicy beef salad (I swear it was cube steak--ick); Ones to order:  machego mac n cheese; stuffed peppers; tortilla with chile vinaigrette;   We ordered a pitcher of mojitos and we were both still standing after dinner.  Translation:  I don't think there was a lick of booze in them.  I loved the fact they piped in songs by the Thievery Corporation on the patio.  Nice touch.
5	When everyone tells you about a place you have to go and see/try for yourself, you just have to!  Firefly was one of those places for me.  Different groups/individuals have told me about Firefly on different locations, and I had to go see what the fuss was about.I love TAPAS, and Firefly definitely took me to paradise with the stuff I ordered and tried.  I had the sliders, stuffed peppers, and the fries.  I decided to go with the favorites since I was with a big group who were all Firefly veterans.  I definitely loved the selections we all got.  I must try this place again, and hopefully I will have a chance to try some sangria while I'm at it.Firefly, I'll be back soon!
4	Firefly is one of those great places in Vegas that's off the Strip which means tourists don't know about it unless they go with a local. They have a great selection of tapas that you don't normally see in most places like Iberico and Ba Ba Reba, and the prices are very reasonable. The first time I went there were 5 people in our group and I don't think we spent $90, and that included drinks. It's a great spot for something different than the usual Strip spots.
4	This is another another place a Vegas local friend took me to on my recent visit. As with Kaizen, this place has a more locals feel. It is off the strip in the same strip mall as Ruth Chris Steakhouse. This restaurant was doing so well that it opened a restaurant next door called DragonFly. Anyway, Firefly is Latin inspired tapas restaurant with a good looking bar. They have small patio area. The decor was hip and modern. The food sampling was good and varied. They have an octopus tapa which I tried. The service was OK to good. We were there for a early dinner late afternoon snack so definitely not peak time. Again as Kaizen, another Vegas locals place to try if you can tear yourself away from the Strip, stripping clubbing, or strip steaks.
5	This Tapas place is really good. 7 of us went for dinner here and we ate good!  The service we had there was pretty good, and the time we waited for our food to come out was pretty much like nothing!  We had two pitchers of Sangria (red and white) and both were delicious.Do try this place if you love tapas! And if you go, try everything! heheI would love to come back here on my next trip to vegas!
5	This is a perfect spot for a large group: everyone gets to sample a little sumthin sumthin and no one feels like they have to commit to too much food.  I was in a group of 7 girls and we each ordered 2 rounds of tapas, all of which were really good.  The two items that stood out were the firefly fries and the stuffed dates.  OMG- the stuffed dates were 2 DIE 4!!!!  I'm not a big date eater...who really is??? But I was shocked as hell when a friend insisted that I try one...since I initially didn't want to waste the space in my tummy with one of these.  The dates were stuffed with almonds, wrapped around with bacon and topped off with blue cheese. Yum Yum Yum!!!Oh- and i can't forget the drinkies.  We ordered a pitcher of red and a pitcher of white Sangria.  I've had better Sangrias elsewhere, but between the two at Firefly, I preferred the red.  My girlfriends were grubbing on the fruit at the bottom of their glasses and leaving the wine....go figure!?!?!  Overall, this is a great place, especially for the wallet.  With the approximate 14+ orders + drinks + tax + tip, divided by 6 girls (exluding the bachelorette), we paid $30 each.  NOT BAD AT ALL!
3	I trekked out here after reading the great reviews and was pretty disappointed. This is a mediocre tapas spot.  There is nothing "amazing" or "fantastic" about it.  *Mushroom Tart with Boursin Cheese- I love mushrooms and Boursin but thepuff pastry was dry and tough- not soft like a croissant- just a hard piece of pastry dough. *Steak & Mushroom Skewers- Boring, steak isn't very good and the sauces are mediocre.  Tastes like diner food.*Baked Brie- this was one of the best dishes- the fondue and tomatoes make a nice combo*Kobe Sliders- these are good although I hated the green chili that was hidden inside the beef- no mention of that on the menu*Fries- these are pretty decent and the accompanying aioli is good*Tomato soup- good but not much different from Campbell'sIf I found myself in the adjoining mall (highly unlikely) and wanted a quick bite- sure I would stop here- but it's not worth seeking out...
5	it was my second time around and i'm so happy my memory didn't fail my tastebuds. for all you san franciscans, it's a cha cha cha's-like restaurant kicked up some notches. more selection, fantastic sangria and great portions for a excellent price.
5	Firefly is excellent!  What a fun place that doesn't feel chain-restauranty like many other places I have been in Las Vegas.  Beautiful patio, reasonable prices and excellent food.  I went with a friend and we shared three tapas and each had a couple of beverages and the prices were reasonable.  I lived in Spain and this brought back memories... I will definitely return and recommend this as a place visitors to Las Vegas go with me when they come to town.
5	My friend wanted to try this place all weekend but due to scheduling conflicts, we weren't able to go to dinner as planned. We did however, eat here for lunch right before we left and it was pretty good. I can admit I don't really care for tapas that much. A lot of the places I've had them at are really overpriced. This place was fairly resonable and the food was excellent as well as the service. Actually, now that I think of it, I probably enjoyed this place more because my two friends that won over the weekend paid for lunch. I think most can agree that food always tastes better when its free.Two are of things I especially liked were the ham and cheese croquetas and the roasted eggplant cannelloni. Mmmmm. I'm really glad we were able to check this place out. As an added bonus, there was a really hot girl with huge knockers sitting across from us. She caught me staring twice ! I know this has nothing to do with my review of this restaurant but I just thought I'd share. After all, sharing is caring.
5	With their reasonable price, friendly waitress and tasty food. What can I say? It's a must-go!! If you are not a buffet fan and want to try out Spanish cuisine, it's a nice choice to try. We had stuffed pepper and seafood rice(sorry, forget the name on menu). They were way better than we expected. Absolutely want to go back and try something else. A place to get relaxed with friends enjoying nice food.
4	Very solid place to sit down and have fun with a group of friends over a pretty varied menu of tapas plates to try from. We went around 5 oclock on a weekday and it was  happy hour, ordered a decent pitcher of red wine sangria for half price. They also has sparkling and white wine sangria, as well as mojitos. My girl and I tried....- Crispy duck rolls (Way heavy on the tangy sauce)- Calamari (Recommended by waiter, but as good as any seafood place)- Firefly Fries (Not a bad basket of fries with Parmesan cheese and seasonings)- Cheese stuffed figs (MMMhhh)- Stuffed mushrooms (Tasty as well, but nothing outstanding)The rest of the party's dishes looked pretty good as well. I would say atmosphere more than the food makes it an enjoyable place to be with friends. Although the prices are not too expensive and you order as much as you want to eat. I think my friends and I might come here again next time we're in vegas.
4	I think I've found a place unique to Vegas -- don't know how true this statement is but it didn't have that chain feel to it.Located in a strip mall five minutes away from Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) is this spot that serves some really tasty tapas and refreshing drinks.  The one thing I will mention about the tapas: seafood dishes are good.Firefly is loud, crowded, and totally fun.  You got folks getting off of work and looking to unwind and chill, groups celebrating b-days, couples enjoying the setting, and a crowded bar with people waiting for the next open table.The staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating.  They were especially cool about my request for pitchers of caparinias instead of glasses.The only thing is parking can be sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot with Ruth Chris's -- so be prepared to search.Overall, local or not, you should give Firefly a try.
5	By far THE BEST PLACE FOR SPANISH TAPAS for hundreds of miles around. I'm torn between giving them 4 out of 5 stars because the lowlights of the hostess's/our unattentive waiter. The food however and the busboy(man) was the stars of the night. We had a helping of their Bacon Wrapped Dates with Cheese/Nuts...I my...Tasting Food Porn WOW. Delicious...To start actually...the Bread with Almond Butter Yum!! Who would've thought Almond would make Butter taste So Good? We also had the Mushroom Puff Pastry tart which was very tastey as well as the Spicy Beef Salad (BEWARE Very Spicey but very Good) and the Duck Egg Rolls (Crunchy, Meatey, and Saucey delicatable). You MUST try the Bacon Wrapped Dates though, it's been 2 days and I'm still thinking about them. How tastey they were and how genius. AMBIENCE: Red and More Red lighting. Very hip place. Plenty of Good Atmosphere. A great buzz. Packed for sure. RESERVATIONS a MUST a long as the Hostess don't screw them up. We thought we'd successfully changed out reservation time, come to find out they hadn't done anything to it. The waiter was also too busy focusing on his bigger tip/group tables.
4	My nickname "the Spaniard" immediately  gives me the authority to judge this establishment, and with the help of Yelp! I will do my best to do it justice!First of all... this place is spitting distance from Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. I say that just to involve some perspective on its proximal competition. Despite what the bell boys may say, it is also walking distance from the Renaissance (or the convention center for that matter) if that is a question in any traveler's mind. I will say, however, if you choose to walk for dinner expect a surly backstreet Vegas-style walk down "Paradise."Firefly, although far from the Spain that I know, is a great dinner spot. It is off the strip, and surprisingly unassuming and unpretentious. We were seated on the patio on a uniquely  warm winter night and remained comfy, but if you actually make reservations I would recommend the inside even though it seemed mucho crowded in the cold weather. We ordered 4 Tapas: The stuffed bell peppers, the Serrano ham and Manchego plate, the diablo shrimp, and the pork empanadas. To drink we had a pitcher of Red Sangria. Without any hesitation I will say the tapas were delectable, and I would order them all again... especially the shrimp. The Red Sangria on the other hand was full of ice aka watery and contained no other fruit that I saw other then small apple chunks. We finished off the meal with the flan and the bread pudding, and both desserts were very good. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for variety of the Spanish persuasion. Great Tapas.The only downside to this place was the music. It was far too loud on the patio, and it went from a Spanishy Gypsy Kings mix to some bizarre techno mix half way through the night. Not a big fan of that, but it wasn't enough to put a damper on a wonderful evening at the Firefly.
5	love this place.  it's got everything you need for date night, girls night, friends night...any night!great ambiance, amazing mojitos, yummy food, very intimate!!  also, the tapas portions allows you to try everything.  it's a great way to dine.2 thumbs up!! way up!some of my favorites:smoked salmon platterempanadasbaked briestuffed mushroomssteak skewersand..BANANA NUTELLA SANDWICHES...enjoy!
5	Grab some friends... order sangria, the shrimp, the garlic fries. Get some more sangria. Laugh with authentic Vegas people... god totally fun! Go.. now!
4	Thank you thank you thank you Yelp. As soon as I walked into the Las Vegas airport I knew this city would its hardest to convince me that I wanted its flashiest, loudest, and scantily-scandalousy-est. Well ha! I have Yelp. Does *your* iPhone app save you from one of the grossest cities on earth? Because of Yelp, I knew to forget the Bellagio buffet. Skip the Paris buffet. Avoid the Wynn. I actually really wanted to go to Lotus of Siam, which somehow both Gourmet magazine and the LA Times think is the best Thai in America, but reservations were booked through the weekend and drop-in wait was 2 hours. And I hadn't scammed any guy into taking me to Joel Robuchon. Enter Firefly. Convinced a childhood friend and his buddies to come here, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. Not too pricey, about $30 per. Only an $8 cab ride away from the strip, and no wait. Sangria: A must-have with tapas. Obviously. This was watered-down approximately 4X normal. It took me half a glass to get drunk! Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates: Yummy signature dish. The crispy texture and saltiness of the bacon paired well with the sweet, chewy date and creamy nutty stuffing. Frites: I love frites. These were pretty good, better than room service but not as good as Chez Maman. Delicious aioli. Baked brie: Eh. Not bad, not outstanding. Steamed mussels with chorizo: I was not expecting this to be a soup. Sour, tomato-y, tangy, so I liked it a lot. Tuna tartare: Probably the worst thing we ordered. Ew.Mac & cheese with manchego: I wouldn't have ordered this and the brie, but one of the guys is really into cheesy things. It was ok. Spicy shimp: Super spicy = awesome! The shrimp wasn't that fresh though.
5	*Great sangria and all the tapas were very good.  *The music and service was above average.*We thought prices were quite reasonable.  Finally, a place that lived up to the hype and recommendations.
5	WOW!I was completely blown away by this place.  My friend from Vegas lives and dies by this place, and I now know why!Upon our arrival into Las Vegas, my friend immediately decided that this is where we would be eating for dinner.  After a quick shower and some down time, we finally met back up with my friend and hailed a cab to Firefly.Miami needs a Firefly!  What a great ambiance.  When we first arrived, they were a bit crowded and we sat at the bar to have a couple of drinks and await our table.  Not too long after, we were seated in a seperate area that was originally the restuarant next door.  Great atmosphere and loved the decoration.  Low lighting, lots of use of the color red.  Totally my vibe!  :)I was advised that EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely delicious, and that I MUST try the croquetas and empanadas.  Alrighty then, I said.  Here we go!  Oh, and the Sangria is a must-try too!Between 3 of us we had:*the Ham & Cheese Croquetas - OMG, delish!  Soooo tasty with the addition of the cheese!  A new fave.*the Empanadas (with Pork) - very tasty and cooked to perfection, with the crispiest, flakiest dough that melts in your mouth.*the Crispy Duck rolls - these were good, but not my fave.  A little gamey for my taste, and I usually really like duck, but the crispyness was good and I enjoyed the cherry sauce drizzled over...*Petite Filet - hands down my FAVE dish of the night.  The filet was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were just melt-in-your-mouth good!  The roasted potatoes that were also mixed in, along with the red wine sauce, were just PERFECTION.  :)*Manchego Mac&Cheese - what an awesome twist on a traditional dish!  I must learn to make this at home.*Tuna Tartare - WOW!  I've never had such delicious tuna.  It was not served as traditional thin slices, but in small diced pieces with a delicious sauce (not sure what the sauce was) drizzled over it, served on a bed of edamame and enoki salad with taro chips.  I would use the chip to pile on everything else on top of it and then eat this crunch concoction!  SOOOO GOOD!For dessert we all shared the Banana-Nutella sandwiches, which were ORGASMICLY divine!  My new favorite dessert!  SOOOO tasty.I give this place 5+++++ Stars!  I wish I would have had the chance to return while on my trip, but alas it was too short.  I will DEFINITELY be back here the next time I am in Vegas to try the rest of the items on the menu!
4	Service was a bit spotty and one of my colleagues had a really gross drink (I think a mojito) here, but other than that, it was a great place to go for dinner. A great list of various tapas and we had several: tortilla espanola (they put hot sauce on it, so watch on it), sliders (yummy), shrimp diablo, stuffed peppers (delish), and several others which I forget. It was all quite tasty, but a few dishes were a little too spicy for me. I am a wimp though, so they might be better for you. Go for the sangria too - it's quite tasty! The atmosphere is nice - it's dark and a little more cozy than other places in Vegas.
4	This restaurant has a very hit and trendy environment.  The tapas are very good and the sangria was really yummy.  It was my first time having sparkling wine sangria.  We had the duck egg rolls, the eggplant, the filet mignon sliders, the stuff mushroom, and the tuna tartare.  All were very good.  The only thing I would pass on next time are the sliders.  This place is loud and is great for a late night bite.  The place is crowded but we didn't have to wait at all for a table.  This place seems like the place to be and I swear I saw some famous entertainers at the next table.
3	Can't give an accurate review as we just got drinks and then went to Batista's later that night. Drinks were good and strong....will update when I try the food, service was good.
5	I love this place!! I'm coming back here or sure next time I'm in Vegas. It was nice to eat somewhere off the strip!! The food was so good and the waiter was super nice. The drinks were pretty good too! If you just wanna get off the strip and have dinner; go to firefly!
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!Every time I take a trip to Las Vegas, which is about every 2-3 months, i make sure I take a trip down to Fireflys!  Even if I am staying up at Green Valley, it is worth dealing with the Strip..... Trust Me.I first found this place on Racheal Ray's show..... and remembered to check it out... each time I take a new guest to this place they LOVE it.The best part about this place is that you can get  a "Strip" dinner (Special, Location, Festive, Fun) without the Strip price!!      The last 2 times I went there, with one other, we had 4 Tapas, each a drink, and dessert... we walked out with paying under $55 incl tip!*****FAVs*****Wrapped DatesSlidersFilet, Chorizo, & Shrimp skewers PLUS(i dont care how full you are, you MUST try..)TRES LECHE for dessert... Heavenly
5	The tapas here are moderately priced and very good! The service is fast. It is a very cool place to just hang out and get a drink also. On weekend nights, you should call ahead to make a reservation, as the wait may get quite long. There seems to be a lot of locals who go here. I was shown this place by a friend who lives in Vegas and have loved it ever since. I try to go here every time I'm in LV. Last time I was here for dinner.. my friends and I ordered a bunch of tapas and  the bill came out to be about $20 per person. The paella was not bad but it's an entree, not a tapas plate. The garlic fries are very good, tapas priced, but comes in a big bowl. The other things that I ordered were the empanadas, thai beef salad, croquettas, and meat skewers. I can't remember what else i had, but it was all very good. I highly recommend this place to everyone. The mushroom pastry was EXCELLENT!
4	We come here every time we go to Vegas, and although it's off the strip it's a nice refreshing change to the restaurants in the casino's. The food is great, the prices are very reasonable and it has a really fun and lively atmosphere.Worth making the trip off the strip for!
4	Everything we had was good.  Loved the petite filet...great deal for $10.
4	"Firefly" is somewhat of a misplaced moniker choice since it invokes memories of the excellent, if short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series.Overall, a very simply, and elegantly designed restaurant.  In a city where excess and flash are norms, Firefly provides a refreshing milieu.  I got the feeling that it caters less to tourists, but rather to the local white collar work force.Our lunch menu was a assembled tapas selection.  There were enough choices to cobble together an expansive meal, yet not too large as to be overwhelming.  The obligatory free appetizer consisted of toasted baguette slices with green garlic olives and sweet jalapeno butter.  These was also a good and extensive selection of Tazo teas.Some examples of sampled food: (the good)Mushrooms stuffed with chorizo:Garlicy shrimp (came with plenty of sauce)Potato bravas (less spicy than usual, and much tastier)Tuna Tartar (not technically a traditional Tapa, but a good variation on the neo classic dish)The mediocre:Artichoke hearts on toast (tasted too canned)Gazpacho (lacked definition)
3	Good tapas, but overpriced for what you get, I think. Friendly bartenders and great mojitos, but too cramped and too loud for my taste (yes, I'm over 40).    And just the fact that this place is so damn popular and trendy annoys the hell out of me.   Glad I tried it, but I probably won't be back unless my friends drag me.
4	I've always loved firefly. It's more of a bar so it's not super relaxing but the food is good and it's a lot of fun with a small group of friends! My favorite thing there is the tres leches so-far it's the best one I've found in town. The tuna tartar is good, the lamb, the tomato basil soup, and the stuffed dates! Try it all it's pretty cheap! My friends all like the sangria here I don't like red wine so I wouldn't know but this is a fun place to try at least once!!
5	Anyone who rates this anything below five stars is crazy. Anyone who says this place is overpriced is crazy. You can order the entire menu for $100.This place stands out because it's open late, the food is delicious, and it's off the strip and unpretentious.The Sangria is phenomenal and strong. The wait staff is efficient and friendly.If you get anything, get the bacon wrapped dates. You'll thank me later.This is easily my favorite restaurant in the continental US and I make trips to Las Vegas specifically to eat here.
4	A nice tapas joint! That just happens to serve a pretty kick ass Sangria! When you walk into "Firefly", it's kinda of dark and pretty unassuming! Till you get a nice table out on the patio! Now, this is just perfect to people watch and act a fool, or behave, which ever your looking for...all while drinking Sangria's!The food is an unassuming mix of the new and old. One standout for me was the sliders they have available! The Calamari is something you can pass on, but everything else is up to par with the taste and pricing of a place like this. 4*'s for the drinks and vibe, not quite 5, because the food is ok, no WOW factor! Maybe I'm too critical? Enjoy!
4	Delicious! Nice vibe inside, great place to hang out with friends and sample different finger foods. I took my GF here and it was good dining experience. The place can get packed especially thurs-Sat, so the waiter can get a little tied up when having to deal with multiple tables. I prefer to dine in the adjoining area that used to be Dragonfly. Since they have their own kitchen, the food comes out faster and there are less tables, so its more intimate. The firefly fries and calamari are awesome! I've also had the brie, fillet sliders, tiera de mar skewers, and baby back ribs. I'll try the dates next. The sangria is delicious, but I prefer their passion fruit mojito which is very refreshing.
5	Biggest Tapas proportions that I have seen!!! Also, how can you complain about anything that is under $10 and takes a nano-second to get to your table?Seriously though, if you are looking for a place to take a date, take a hook-up, take your parents, or take your crazy best friends for a night of sangria madness then this is the place! It is cozy, dark-but not toooo dark, lively, cheap, fun, and best of all the clientele is totally random. The food is amazing as an extra added bonus!Try the Tiger Shrimp Ceviche, i swear my mouth had an orgasm.
5	Firefly lived up to every review. The mojitos were amazing (mojitos are my fave and I order them everywhere), especially the Passion Fruit one, and my boyfriend ordered the house-made infused vodka on the rocks, which was also amazing, and not nearly as strong-tasting as you would think. The food was great, and the prices were even better. We sat outside and the service was slow, but it was a monday night. The music was also a bit loud, but oh well. The baby back mango-bbq ribs were awesome and literally falling off the bone. The stuffed dates were amazing, the calamari was thick-cut and delicious. The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken were good, but not great, and same goes for the salmon with brioche toasts. They were both good, but I guess just not what we were in the mood for. We will definitely be going back!We have been back to Firefly about 4-5 times since I last reviewed...still wonderful! They have added a few more tapas dishes to the menu, and it seems some of the portions got bigger, which we were happy about. We were especially happy they were able to sit us on Valentine's Day with no reservation (Dragonfly was closed and they were apparently using their dining room for the spillover...or maybe it was just another dining room?), the service was fast and the waiter kept our mojitos filled to the brim. After about 5 or so trips here now, I can definitely say it is one of our all-time favorite places to eat in all of Vegas. It's easy, affordable, delicious, the ONLY negative is the atrocious parking lot..but that's no one's fault...there are 5 other restaurants in the same small shopping center, and that's just poor planning.
4	This place has delish Tapas!  My personal favs are: firefly fries, MANCHEGO MAC N CHEESE, roasted eggplant cannelloni, and baked brie (w/o the chorizo).  And they have awesome sangria!!my only gripe with them is that have made their proportions smaller, which is annoying.  But its still good, and worth the trip down there.  Its a fun, loud place with great food!
5	A favorite stop for my friends and I, Firefly is a great off-the-Strip spot with amazing food, great atmosphere, fast service and good drinks.You must try the Filet Mignon Sliders! Ok, I'm going to have to finish this review later because I just made myself hungry
4	It was a very unique dining experience, being new to the tapas concept.  The food is very good, just not as good as they believe it is.  The Sangria was crisp, fruity and tasty.  The tapas platters were all each very good.
4	I'll preamble with a disclosure of my hatred of Vegas.  But, for being in Vegas, this place was pretty mellow.  The food was good and they had a lot of good wines on the menu.  The prices were also surprisingly great.  I had a glass of wine and we each ordered one or two dishes each (tapas, so order more than just one per person).  I walked out spending $21 with tip.I found the service to be a little bit slow, but I won't raise a huge stink about it because it was admittedly very busy and our waiter otherwise did a great job.I would recommend this place highly.  Start your night off here and have a good time in this terrible city.There's a good cigar bar and shop in the same strip mall, too.All of the hot girls come here and its good for groups.  I recommend sitting so you can face the door and lurk the homegirls.
5	I was in town for a convention this week and I had seen a review on TV about Firefly so decided to give it a try. I was in town with 2 chefs (my friends) who I am always a little nervous to go out to dinner with. Chefs can be hard to please because they really know whats up with food. So the pressure was on a bit.....and surprisingly Firefly stood up to the test! There was not one thing we could complain about (OK our server forgot to tell the chef to not put garlic cream on one of the dishes)....well nothing that important anyway. The food was delicious, every bite! The Sangria brought me right back to Barcelona where I got drunk for the first time. I love a good Sangria. I recommend everything, but the Gazpacho, stuffed Piquillo Peppers and Ahi Skewers were my favorites! The atmosphere is great for a date or a party (its gets a tad loud). They play great music and there is a nice romantic red ambiance. I loved it and will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas!
4	This was one of the best meals I have eaten in Vegas. It is perfectly portioned and the food tasted great too. Even the mojitos were good.
1	Just say no. The food was aweful! Atmosphere was trying but LACKING!I will say my friend hadn't had Spanish tapas ever and thought it was okay, not great though.
4	A must-stop for me in Vegas.  Love their Mijitos and Sangrias.  The tapas were great with many variety.  My favorite is the lambshops.  Not so crazy on the Firefly fries--not worth the $5.5 price.Try to get there for Happy Hours.  All drinks are 50%.  If you sit by the bar, you'll get a tapa samplers too.  Also, order by the pitcher.  You'll get 6-7 glass of Mojitos for $28 (or $14 at happy hours).
2	Firefly is a cool place, but much more for the trendy crowd than for the foodies, like me. It was really loud and crowded. The menu did not have anything very adventurous, in fact quite the opposite. The "french fries" tapas were ok. So was the manchego mac and cheese. The grouper was very dry and plain. The salad was acceptable, but the empanadas seemed small for tapas. The albondigas were boring meatballs with no real flavor. The best thing was the paella, and I've had much better.If you are looking for great tapas, this just isn't the place.
4	I love their Tapas, and mojitos...it can be a pain getting a table if you don't reserve ahead of time, because it can get pretty full especially during summer time. It's can be loud, and it's not that big of a place so expect noise.
5	loved this restaurant! a great getaway from the Vegas eat-til-you're-stuffed buffets and with a relaxed, trendy atmosphere.  the service was super - the waiters were very attentive.the foods were reasonably priced, and portions were substantial - portions large enough to enjoy the dish, but just enough so you didn't get sick of it, and to leave you room for the next one.2 of us ordered:- stuffed dates - i swear bacon makes everything taste delicious!- steamed mussels- lamb skewers - delicious!- filet mignon sliders - pitcher of sangria - lots of fruit, very delicious, about 5-6 glasses our bill for 2 came out to about $55 - a great price for a satisfying meal!would definitely like to come back here next time i'm in vegas!
5	If you want to get away from the strip....including the glitz, glamour, and expensive cuisine...come HERE.  They had the biggest tapas portions I've ever had, and I won't even take the time to list what I ordered because everything tasted amazing.With a group of 12 people, with each person ordering 3 - 5 different plates, that's a lot of taste testing.  There wasn't one thing I didn't say..."OMG...that's delicious."The one thing I wished I had tried was the sangria, but the bottomless mojitos were delightful as well.  The service was also great, but it got to the point that there was so much food coming out, that they didn't bother asking what belonged to who...so that got annoying trying to pass down the plates.All in all...I would seriously give this place a chance, even though it might be a small trek for all of you staying along the Strip.  But definitely worth the try.Trust.
5	everything was great! had my 25th b-day dinner here...and it was so much fun! order the mussels, mac and cheese and fries - but pretty much everything on the menu was good...great pairing with a pitcher of mojitos...however, friends set-up a cupcake arrangement for me and there was a cupcake missing...oh, well hope the staff enjoyed it...
4	Food was good, atmosphere was more of a bar type than a resto. Great Flavors.
4	first time i actually had tapas was here at firefly in 2008. they were yummy! i loved loved loved the little brie sandwiches with the tomato soup. everything we had was so good! including the sangria! i will definitely eat here again next time i'm in sin city.
4	Hands down the best tapas joint in Vegas. It is so nice to sit on the patio on a warm (very warm) summer night & drink the delicious sangria or maybe a thirst quenching mojito. Every dish I've ever had here was absolutely perfectly prepared, and I'm sure I've had well over a hundred of them. The service is just as great as well. My only complaint is that over the years they got too popular & were usually on the very crowded side. Although you can avoid this problem by hitting them up for lunch. Cheers to Firefly.***Lots of ladies like to hang out here. Trust me, my Dad noticed this & he doesn't notice much these days.***
4	Still rockin! Best value in Vegas.
4	I had been feening for tapas after trying Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba in Chicago, so finally came out to Vegas on a weekend girls trip and hit this place up for dinner. The place was definitely cute and cozy, with spanish decorations along the wall and dim lighting. My only gripe with the place was how dark it was - it was just a little hard to see our food or maybe I'm just being nitpicky? I have no complaints about the service, our server was attentive and helpful and our food came out fast! (our dinner maybe lasted an hour?)For 7 girls, 1 pitcher of white sangria, 11 tapas & 2 desserts...our bill came out to about $22/person w/ tip!!! so this place definitely scores with the price range and we were definitely content, not starving or overly stuffed! What we ordered: tuna tartare, shrimp ceviche, chorizo clams, curry mussels, stuffed peppers, stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls, manchego mac n cheese, firefly fries, stuffed dates, baked brie, banana nutella sandwiches & chocolate tres leches. We loved everything with the exception of the duck rolls (dont get them!) and their white sangria wasnt up to par with the white mango sangria I had at Ba-Ba-Reeba in Chicago (but then again it really is a hard one to beat!). The  tres leches could have been softer (it seemed a bit stiff) but it was well complemented with the strawberries. I would love to come back again and try all the other things on the menu! Until next time...
4	I've been there so many times, that should say something about how much I like the place =)Here's a list of things I had and what I think about them:Stuffed Dates - texture party in my mouth, great flavor, never fail!Fried Calamari - just like any other good calamari, nothing super specialManchego Mac n Cheese - creamiest mac n cheese I've ever had, MMMMFirefly Fish Sticks - more like fried fish fillets, good flavor, but dry sometimesRoasted Baby Beet Salad - well, its a beet salad, nothing specialSpicy Beef Salad - tasty thai dressing on slices of beef and leafy green, pretty good stuffCeviche of Shrimp - too "soupy" in my opinionTerra y Mare Skewers- good flavor, tender beef, goodtimesFirefly Fries - I can never say no to fries, especially ones top with cheese!Smoked Samon Platter - good standardPlate of Serrano Ham n Cheese - its a pretty yummy dish, my friend said it reminded him of SpainTuna Tartare - not enough saltFilet Mignon Slider - standard stuffCrispy Duck Rolls - too greasyLamp Chops - nothing can go wrong with this oneBabyback ribs - nothing can go wrong with this one either, sweet n tenderPulpo asado - meh...To wash everything down, Mango Mojito is super yum!Blueberry Mojito is so so, and I personally didnt care for their sangria, but I probably just don't like sangrias in general.
4	cheap food in small portions so you can try a little bit of everything. the mac 'n' cheese is delicious; the sun dried tomatoes is what did it for me! french fries were good as well as their red sangria! they're red sangria was worth the trip!
4	The food here was delicious.  Everything came out really quick, and the sangria was amazing.  I liked that they had a fruit/no fruit option, as when there is no fruit in the pitcher you get more sangria for your dollar.  The fruit clogs the straw anyways, so I figure win, win.
5	To my shame, this was the first time I had Tapas in my 25 (at the time) years of existence on Earth.My goodness, this place totally rocks!  I loved everything we ordered and it was regrettable that I did not have a bigger stomach.  Pitcher (or two... or three?) of sangria was tasty.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.Finally, I loved the relative "local joint" feeling.  It's nice to get out of the strip area, even for a little bit, and visit where the locals eat.  I'm sure there are outsiders here too, but it's definitely less than... say Bellagio buffet lol.I imagine that it'll be really fun to go with a big group, so you can order all the varieties and try a little bit.  Yum.  I would definitely come back here again.
4	This place is very good. I am a big fan of tapas because you can try pretty much everything especially if you have a big group. The fries here are awesome. Do not forget the lamb chops, shrimp in garlic butter sauce, stuffed mushrooms, empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. Also, the sangria is quite tasty. I have not had the chance to try everything on the menu but I have a feeling that i will not be disappointed. The service is very good, I never had a bad experience. Tapas and sangria...what else can I say? Oh yeah don't forget the mojitos!
5	Great restaurant!  I highly recommend the stuffed dates, the blood orange mojitos and the tres leches cake is heavenly!!
5	Firefly is an awesome tapas restaurant. I must get the bacon-wrapped dates every time. I also enjoy the camarones a la diabla, albondigas, croquettes and mushroom tart. I have tried many dishes and have not had a bad one.The sangria is by far the best in town.Normally, the service is hit or miss, depending on how busy they are. At times, it can get a bit noisy, so I usually request to sit outside where it's a bit quieter.Overall, a great value for the price.
5	FIREFLY ROCKS!!!  They have awsome service! Awesome food and Awesome Mojitos and Sangrias!  We went there for a bachelorette party with a group of around 20 people and their service was excellent and their food kept coming out!  I loved all the dishes we ordered, the Ahi Tuna, the Calamari, the Surf and Turf, the spicy steak salad...all of it!  I guess if I had to pick, there were only two items that I thought were good but nothing special about them....The Filet Slider Burgers and the Mac & Cheese.  They are good, but no biggie and you're better off ordering something else on the menu to fill your stomach with.  They have a huge menu to order from too!  Best of all their prices are  very reasonable!  About $5 to $10 a dish.  Since we has such a large group, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu so I got to try so many different dishes and I loved them all!  Our bill came out to about $40 per person, which included drinks and tax!!!  If you're ever in Vegas and want to get away from the tourist trap hotel restaurants, go to Firefly!!
4	I LOVE TAPAS. Firefly makes creative and super delicious tapas and one of my friends had been hesistant to make the trip out to Firefly and repented for the rest of the night because the food was sooooo good.  Here's what we ate (groaning and rolling our eyes loudly in delight):*ceviche of shrimp - I'm not gonna lie, 8.50 for 1/3 cup of ceviche makes me sad, but the flavors were great so I slurped it up.*tortilla espanola - classic and delicious. if you go to a tapas bar with no tortilla espanola, leave immediately. *roasted eggplant cannelloni - ultra-thin slices of eggplant that were lightly charred and stuffed with goat's cheese. what else can I tell you?!*stuffed peppers - WOW! so simple and yet sooooo decadent. mama loves cheese, garlic and peppers so this was basically my fave.*manchego mac & cheese - in my mouth please. *albondigas - my friends and I all lived in Seville together and have many not-so-fond memories of greasy albondigas, these were a nice surprise but I wouldn't get them again I guess. PTSD or what have you. Frankly I wanted to keep eating until the kitchen ran out of food. I would have continued on with the roasted squash soup, the veggie empanada, patatas bravas, artichoke toasts, smoked salmon platter, okay and basically the entire rest of the menu. This place isn't as ornate as Boston's Dali, but these tapas are scrumptious and worth a cab ride even if you're just in town to party. Trust me.
4	What a cool place.  If you don't know what Tapas are, it's basically small side dishes/appetizers.  This place has is down, you can order all sorts of Tapas until you are full.  It's reasonable on price for what you get to try and everything tastes good.It has a full bar and it's packed and popular with the young crowd.  Great people watching for sure.
4	I love this place for group outings. It can get kind of loud so if you're looking for a nice, quite restaurant on a Friday night...not here.The prices are extremely reasonable and the Tapas are really good.  I have been satisfied every time I've gone.....Get the Sangria. Try the mushroom tart and the mac & cheese.Highly recommended!
4	Firefly is the kind of place we usually like to take visitors from out of town when they want something cool and hip, but without the chaos of the strip (nor the exuberant prices).They started us off with a plate of bread, buttery good stuff, and green olives as we checked out the menu.  To get things started for our party of five, we ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria ($24).  To grub on...* Stuffed dates "bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" ($4) - Everyone always loves these.  It's just a bite of intense flavor and goodness, and there's bacon!  About four to an order. * Terra y Mare skewers "grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde" ($10) - Came with three skewers, it was good, not great, but okay.* Firefly" fish sticks "fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce" ($6) - Arrived with two sticks per order.* Merguez "spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit, grilled bread" ($8) - A strong taste that gets some getting used to. The Husband was loving this stuff.* Pulpo asado "marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato" ($7.50) - The octopus was bit overcooked, not quite what I expected.  But then again, it probably was frozen and that altered the texture a bit.* Steamed mussels "red curry, white wine and coconut cream" ($8) - My favorite of the bunch, full of flavor in this red curry with two slices of toasted cheese bread for dipping.  I saved the sauce for my paella and bread.* Ahi tuna skewer "mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze" ($10) - Cooked tuna, which I don't care for too much.  Our friend got lured into ordering this by the waitress he thought was cute.* Paella "saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage" ($15) - Good stuff with lots of good stuff in it.  Tasty, and of course, even better with the red curry sauce from the Steamed Mussels dish.* Sparkling Sangria ($24 pitcher) - Enough to fill at least five glasses and really tasty too.  It's a light drink, with only a bit of fruit bits in it.  But definitely enjoyable by guys and girls.  We ordered another pitcher during our visit.Overall, some food times are good and standout-worthy while others can remain unseen.  The sangria is perfect for sharing and has enough alcohol in it for you to be feeling pretty good.  Service was better in the beginning with our waitress checking up on us and our dirty plates disappearing in a timely manner.  It slacked off a bit when our waitress didn't come around anymore and when the busboys were a bit overanxious in trying to clear plates that weren't empty yet.3.5 starsHappy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays: 3 pm to 6 pmFridays: 3 pm to 5 pm (1/2 off all drinks)Tuesdays: Latin Night, from 10 pm to 2 am (salsa, meringue, cumbia, rock, no cover)
5	The best tapas in town. Must try their Mac n'Cheese. Now I know what you're thinking, Mac n'Cheese?! Why would anyone go to a tapas place for that?! But this is way better than any another Mac n'Cheese you had even had. Other super tasty dishes are their spicy beef salad, lamb crop, stuffed data, sliders and so much more. AND their Sangria, they have awesome Sangria. Get a pitcher and share it with your friends. The place get hotter late at night. Except to wait, this place is pack all the time.
5	I live in LA and I come to Vegas every year for New Years and this is the one spot that I have to hit up each and every time.Four words = AMAZINGLY ORGASMICALLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD!!!!I think by now I've tried all the tapas on their menu already and I would have to give each tapas 5 stars each so that equals out to hundreds of stars total for Firefly. :DMy favorite tapas are:-Filet Mignon Sliders-Empanadas-Fried Calamari-Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms-Tuna Tartare -Crispy Duck Rolls-Ham and Cheese CroquetasEven their fries are off the hook because it has a hint of parmesan, herbs, and aioli and their Mojitos - I can get drunk off of that all day everyday. yUuMmMmmYlicious to EVERYTHING on the menu - no joke!
4	Super busy on our arrival Saturday night. Met up the birthday boy and friends at 8:30pm. They were already down a pitcher of Mojito, and we quickly ordered another pitcher of Sangria for the table.I know better than to eat too much before going out dancing so Joy P. and I kept it simple with just an order of ceviche (a little watery), and paella (delicious).  The menu was an interesting mix of spanish, asian, and cuban(?). The other orders basically the rest of menu, and the stand outs were the bacon wrapped dates and ... and i don't remember eating anything else.
4	This is a great place to go off the strip.  We actually went twice while we were in town.  You can't beat the great food and reasonable prices.  I highly recommend the dates, empanadas, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms!
4	I wasn't a big fan of Tapas before, but after having our Bachelorette Dinner at Firefly...I'm hooked like Flies.  Wow...the food was fantastic.  Almost everything we had on the menu was sooo good.  The decor of the place is rather quaint as well.  Such a great hand out place off the strip.  Located right next to Ruth Chris.  Definitely a must visit place when in Vegas.Pricing, cheap especially compared to Strip prices.
4	I have been to firefly a few times and every time I am satisfied. The Manchego Mac and Cheese is AMAZING....as is the eggplant mannicotti and the Serrano ham chilled tapa.Service was good with a bit of a wait but more than enough room to stand at the bar.One word of warning, don't mix a pitcher of Sangria, with a gin and tonic, and a jack and coke. Bad idea.
4	Just when I think I have game....Girl: Yeah!  It's my birthday!!!Archie: Nice, where you from?Girl: Colorado.Archie: Awesome, so how old are you tonight?Girl: Guess!Archie: Ok, (better guess young so I don't offend) I am thinking 25??Girl: *GASP*  NO!!  I am 21!!Archie: Oops.She could do with using more sunblock on a daily basis.Anyways...this is actually my second time to Firefly.  Both times have been good.  It's well off the strip but always seems to attract a large & loud crowd.Recommend the mac & cheese, the ceviche, and the pork ribs.SPF.
4	This is by no means the first time I have been to Firefly. It has been a place I go now and then over the years for a late night bite to eat or a social gathering or two. Sometimes it's loud and there are tons of people.. but the food usually quality and if you can get a table you are golden. I went again the other night and it seems they have done away with alot of the clutter, added more dining areas and used the once "Dragonfly" Sushi next door ( a short-lived endeavor) and turned it into a disco ball having lounge of sorts. ( I haven't ventured in there yet) So the dining room is free for just that. The food is always good, inexpensive and easy to get to. Between my friend and I, we shared a pitcher of red sangria, 4 tapas and dessert.. the bill was about 60 bucks. Not bad for an hour and a half of dining for two peeps. Check it out. Its a fun spot!
4	A great place for a late night dinner.  I absolutely love tapas and the food here was not bad at all.  But I do have to say I wish our server told us while we were ordering that this so called small plates were not that small.  Coming from SF I really expect SMALL plates.  Dinner for 8 was super cheap $150 and that is with alcohol and we were stuffed.We had the white sangria...it was yummy tasted like juice.  I seriously think we over ordered.  We had the tuna tartare, sliders, calamari, ceviche, paella and a bunch of other stuff.  Everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great.  I would definitely come back again if time allows the next time I come back to Vegas.
5	I absolutely love Firefly and am so glad Rachael Ray introduced me to it two years ago.  I make sure to come every time I'm in Vegas and this past visit, my boyfriend and I came here three times, lol.My favorite dishes:~ Camarones a la Diabla: OMG!!  Best shrimp ever.  I love their spicy sauce and am so glad they give you the plate of complimentary bread so I can mop up all the leftover sauce.  Actually, the sauce would make anything taste good.  A must try!!~ Firefly Fries: Lots of garlic and parmesan cheese ~ delish!~ Paella: rice is tasty and they don't skimp on the seafood.~ Steamed Mussels: it comes in a coconut curry sauce that is good enough to drink.  Not very spicy but good curry flavor.  Mussels are very fresh and steamed to perfection.Other recommended dishes:~ Patatas Bravas~ Stuffed Dates~ Fried Calamari~ EmpanadasNot so good dishes:~ Baked Brie: I think I didn't enjoy it much because the cheese wasn't as hot as I expected it to be and it wasn't that special.~ Terra y Mare Skewers: the filet mignon was really dry and wasn't very tasty in general.~ Tuna Tartare: the tuna was in huge chunks and not marinated enough.~ Caramel Flan: meh...I've had better flan, texture wasn't very smooth.Overall, still a great tapas place  Prices are pretty reasonable and it's just great being able to try a bunch of small dishes and not having to fill up on an entree.  Great place to have a few drinks and kick back with some friends or to have a romantic date.  Yay for Firefly!
5	We were visiting Vegas and decided to go off the strip for some local flavor. Thanks to Yelp, I decided on Firefly and made reservations the same day. We arrived a little early, but even though it was very busy, they had our table ready. We ordered the camarones a la diabla, stuffed dates (they aren't mentioned 28 times on Yelp for nothing), empanadas, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Everything was yummy. I listened to Katelynn L's review and avoided the dishes she mentioned. I would suggest the first 3 dishes for sure. The mushrooms were good, but nothing special that I would reorder. By the time we sat down and we finished our dinner, it was 30 minutes. Talk about the fastest service ever!! I don't think it was even 5 minutes before our dishes started coming out after we ordered. The food is wonderful, ambiance is dimly lit but fun. Seems like a great place to go to with a group. The server suggested 2 tapas per person and you can move on from there. We had a large lunch, so 4 plates were perfect. Its a 5 min cab ride to/from the strip, about $8. Its located in a strip mall behind the Palazoo. Cabs are abundant in the evenings when leaving and it seems to get really busy here even on a weekday. Our total bill was $35 and that was also with 2 glasses of sangria.Its a definite revisit next time I'm back in Vegas. I wish I was hungrier so I could have tried more of the tapas. I'm usually not a HUGE fan of tapas, but I love Firefly! We have a Baba-Reeba in Chicago and I would suggest this place over that, though I haven't tried the Baba-Reeba in Vegas.
4	Stuffed dates? Nothing I'd ever order.Luckily, I tried them. And they were delicious. And most of what I ate here was great! Along with the dates, I sampled the empenadas, petite filet, chicken chrorizo stuffed mushrooms, shrimp a la diabla, and the nutella sammiches for dessert. The stuffed mushrooms were disappointing since they were under the heat lamp for too long, so the cheese was hard and not very tasty. But everything else was pretty great. The Sangria rivaled what I've had in Spain (or at least, what I remembered I've had in Spain), and it was a great lively feel to the place.It was absolutely packed on a Tuesday night, though. So reservations are recommended. Although I'm not a local, I was treated like I was an regular, with attentive and helpful service from our server and the busboy quickly grabbing our old plates to make room for the new ones. I'll be back here again, hopefully for Happy Hour next time.
5	Amazing atmosphere and delicious food!! We went there on a Friday night and the place was packed with about 25 people waiting to get in. Even so, we were seated in about 20 minutes. The place is dimly lit and resembles a club more than a restaurant but the atmosphere and vibe is great. We ordered a pitcher of mojitos, the veggie empanadas, patatas bravas, empanadas and camarones a la diabla. Each and every dish was fantastic and I would especially recommend the camarones diabla. I'm so glad we decided to go here and I cant wait to go back to Vegas to try more of the menu.
4	This is a very good Tapas place on Paradise. A wide variety of choices to choose from. Some traditional Tapas, some relatively unique.All of the food is good. My favorite were the filet mignon sliders. They also have a full bar, including a wide selection of flavored Mojitos.The service was fast & prompt and there food was delivered pretty efficiently. On a nice night, ask to be seated outside.This place is in a strip mall and seems to have a good local crowd.
4	We came here in the middle of our trip, it's a little off the strip ($8-10) cab ride, and completely worth it, especially for the money you'll save. Great food, quick service, reasonable wine list unlike the rest of the city, and a good time. Since most people go to vegas in groups, it's great to go w/a bunch of people and order everything that sounds good. Tapas style, so small plates that are for sharing. Stuffed dates, fishsticks, lentils, stuffed mushrooms, manchego mac n cheese, and on and on. Delicious.
4	Great food, cool environment, stays open late, good House Music (Miguel Miggs, Samantha James, Kaskade, Julius Papp, I recognized most of the songs they played). I've been to Firefly twice and have enjoyed their food thoroughly both times.My friend and I started off with baby back ribs and filet mignon sliders with an additional side order. The portions are small, so if you wanted order a little bit of everything, you could definitely get a stab at a good portion of the menu. A pitcher of Red Sangria was perfect to wash the food down with. We ended the evening with a dessert platter which was excellent! Very easy on the taste buds.. The service for the evening was great. Our server was great with his timing and very attentive to our needs... So you're probably wondering why I docked one star? Well.. I know this place is loud.. but certain people were noticebly loud even in such an environment.. There was a guy with a group of his friends, obviously coked out of his mind, screaming obscenities over his cell phone and smacking himself in the face, acting like a primate on speed... I ignored this the whole time, but my friend was obviously extremely bothered by it... We stayed cool about it, cuz we understand there's obviously people who can't handle even being in Vegas without obliterating every part of themselves that make them human... I just wish the staff may have noticed this and at least took the time to tell him to calm down..So other than poor version of Kid Rock on crack, the rest of the experience was fine. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a nice, fun, dining experience without having to sacrifice their entire wallet.
4	If there is a reason why anyone would move to the God forsaken desert town full of sin and mischief, it would be so they could dine at Firefly on Paradise on a whim without driving 200 miles. If you think you've had a good tapas experience, think again. Firefly on Paradise had such creative plates that offer such an eclectic combination of flavors. It is definitely a dining experience you will leave thinking you won't forget because this is the only place that offers them. Their eggplant cannellonis are amazing.  The Lemon Chicken served with Firefly french fries were so fresh and tasted like home cooked goodness.  Definitely coming back here when we're in Vegas again.  The prices are decent considering the quality and portion size and the fact that it's a Tapas bar.  They don't take reservations though and the wait can be long and trust me, you don't want to sit outside in 106 degree weather.
4	Off the Strip - this cool place is open late until 2 am serving small plates. I had the Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and the Empanadas. Both were excellent plus they gave me bread and some cheese spread stuff that was good too.
4	Off the strip, but close enough for any visitor to get to.  Great selection of tapas.  Loved how the service didn't rush us.  Save room for the Tres Leche Cake for dessert.
5	Excellent small plates, especially for a late night meal. My search for a Mexican place on my GPS unit came up with this place,  and although it is obviously not a Mexican place, I was pleasantly surprised. Located inside a strip mall ( like everything else in Las Vegas), they have a small patio, which we dined on. We arrived around 1 AM and received prompt, very friendly service. I figured when we arrived so late, with the kitchen closing at 1:30, we would be rushed to order. In fact, it was exactly the opposite. After we ordered, the server told us to hold on to a menu, should we decide that we wanted to try something else, which indeed we did.The three of us shared several small plates, including the mushroom/steak skewers, empanadas (my favorite), shrimp in chile sauce (a close second),  meatballs, cream cheese stuffed peppers and a warm spinach salad, all delicious.  Not too expensive (all the above plus a martini and a margarita for around $70 plus tip), and for a late night meal, it is a new favorite for me!
5	This is still my favorite restaurant in the country, and that's saying a lot.I've eaten here so many times. Here are the MUST HAVES at firefly that you won't get many other places.- Boquerones (anchovies on toast with roasted red pepper, avocado)- Shrimp Ceviche (out of this world)- Bacon Wrapped Dates (unghhhhhhh)- Manchego Mac n Cheese (unghhhhhhh)- Empanadas (unghhhhhhh)- Chorizo Clams (clams in a thin red sauce with chorizo, mmmmm)- Ahi tuna skewersI mean, I love everything on the menu, but this is a standard meal for 4 people at Firefly, in my opinion. So so so so so good.
5	I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I make a point to go here at least a few times every time I go to Vegas. The food here is waaaay better than that of the hotel restaurants, which for the most part is overpriced garbage. My fave dishes...Veggie EmpanadasTomato Soup and mini grilled cheese (I always have to add a half pack of sugar to the soup)Shrimp, I forget the name but I think it's in a garlic butter sauce.Chicken Skewers- out of this world, not dry at all and so tastyI haven't had them in a while, but I also remember the Duck Eggrolls being very yummy.Beet Salad was good tooThe mushroom tart was not my fave, kinda boring. Puff pastry triangles with mushrooms and cream sauce poured on top. I also was not loving the bread pudding.
4	Even though it was a hot summer night, my friend and I decided to sit out on their patio. I actually preferred the patio: it was much more laid-back and quieter outside, so we could hear each other talk. Sangrias were refreshing and tasty, and kept us parched. We ordered calamari, shrimp ceviche, spicy potatoes, and some kind of mushroom pastry. Everything we had was absolutely yummy. Their calamari was spot on delicious, but that mushroom puff pastry was spectacular. It's nice eating off the Strip occasionally, so definitely make the trip away from the chaos to have some tapas, sip some sangria, and take a break from the madness.
5	I like the atmosphere almost as much as the small plates. It's busy and lively, and the waitstaff are helpful and friendly without being overly familiar or intrusive. The food is fantastic! We tried 5 dishes and loved them all.
4	Now that I've been here 3 times, I feel like a review is in order! Service has been hit or miss, but I'll let it slide until there are serious issues. Atmosphere is fun for groups or a date (although I'd warn it's a little loud - not the best place for conversation).Drinks: Freaking awesome. I've enjoyed most of the mojitos I've tried (particularly like the pineapple coconut "paradise" flavored one), and I also really enjoy the sangria. I'm disappointed their HH ends at 6 PM, however. Food: I love the mix of spanish and new american tapas they have. The duck rolls, sliders, and mac and cheese are all favorites of mine although I realize they aren't spanish at all! I do think they do a better job of "plating" the tapas here than Babreeba - for instance the beer battered shrimp come with a huge plate of assorted fried veggies. Overall a fun off the strip place to go. We went there with a group of 12 last night and got buzzed and full for $40 each with tax and tip. Not bad for Vegas.
5	We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it in Vegas.  Its a little bit off the strip, but no worries.  There were four of us and to start we ordered 8 plates and a pitcher of Mojitos. First the Mojito was actually too minty, but once the ice melted a bit, it was excellent.  The first 8 dishes came out, I don't remember them all but it was fantastic.  The highlights were a savory shrimp dish, the filet migon sliders, and fried calamari.For the second round we just asked the waiters for suggestions, have gave us three and they might have been the three best dishes for the whole meal.    Try the Stuffed Dates, Bacon + Dates + Cheese, so freaking good. We also got the Diablo shrimp and these skewers with sausage, beef and shrimp.All in all this places is amazing, in particular the shrimp dishes.
5	This place was awesome!  We went here on our first day in Vegas, and it did not disapoint.  We had four people, so we were able to get a ton of different dishes, and none of them were bad, though some were just ok.  Most, however, are great.  Make sure you ask your waiter what is good...ours did not lead us wrong.  Best dishes were the filet mignon sliders, merguez, and the stuffed dates.
4	The food here was good and unique! I would recommend slightly dressing up... like with slacks and a nicer shirt/top. I went in a t-shirt, capris, and flip-flops and felt under-dressed.
5	What a fabulous date place!I have been here many times but had taken a hiatus until a hot date suggested tapas...We made reservations for 8PM Saturday, got dolled up and went to town!We were seated right away and the hostesses were very friendly.  Our waitress was awesome and the other staff constantly refilled our waters and removed plates.  Considering it was wall-to-wall packed, our food came out extremely fast!  We ordered a pitcher of red sangria...mmm!  I might have had 3/4ths of it!  For grub, we had lamb skewers over lentils (soooo yummy), crispy duck rolls, tuna tartare with taro chips, vegetable empanadas (looove the sauce on them), manchego mac n cheese, and tortilla espaniola (potato omelette).  These were ordered over 2 rounds so we could pace ourselves.  Food was hot, delivered fast, and very tasty.  It set us up to walk around Fremont Street and my date won the equivalent of our dinner cost back at 4 Queens playing blackjack (luck be a lady!!)
5	Ok, We Love it!A friend of a friend suggested that we meet them at Firefly on Paradise...at first were very hesitant. So we yelped it, gave it a try and we loved it so much we went back the next night! The food is absolutely delicious, the service is the same and the Sangria is to die for. We had both the veggie and pork empenadas which were arguably the best I've ever had. The ceviche was amazing, the bacon wrapped dates were also amazing. The filet/shrimp skewers were also good, and the Filet Migon sliders were BOMB!We ordered the Red Sangria which we loved! We didn't get a chance to try the others, but we will next time we plan our trip to vegas.
4	Tapas and sangria... check.  Dim mood lighting... check.  Noisy, boisterous drunken conversation... check.  A long waiting list at 10pm?  Very impressive.Firefly is a hip, party type place and very popular.  Unless you are going on a Monday night, don't think you are going to stroll in here on a Saturday night (even at 9pm) and get a table right away.  Make a reservation and get yourself opentable.com points.  I arrived 20 minutes early and was promptly seated.  Perhaps it was because it was just a party of 2 or perhaps they are just on the ball.  They generally had several large parties, so I am sure it is coordination nightmare.Be sure to confirm your reservation and show up on time.  Otherwise, they will give away your table.Service is as good as one can expect for a super busy restaurant.Food consists of small dishes running about $5-10, with a few large dishes such as paella for $15.  You can see the menu online with exact pricing.  Expect that you will need 3-5 dishes per person depending on appetite.  Alcohol is fairly reasonable, though not really a bargain.  I figure a $6 sangria is fair for the most part.We had smoked salmon on toast with cream cheese, paella, beef skewers, duck rolls, warm spinach salad and fish sticks.  The only dish that sort of missed the mark was the paella.  It had pockets of extreme flavor and pockets of extreme blandness.  I guess they didn't mix it enough or maybe that is how paella is supposed to be?  Each order, aside from the paella, serves two... maybe three, so plan accordingly.They is no valet parking.  Just swing around behind Ruths Chris to find ample parking.A pretty good strip mall for restaurants.  Yolie's is here, too.
5	We came here last time we were in Vegas and loved it, so last weekend when we were in Vegas again we had to come back.  We brought a Vegas resident friend who had never been here before and she loved it too.  It's a very cool place.  Both times we've gone have been during the day, but I can see how this would be a great evening date place, although from other reviews it looks like it gets pretty busy on weekend evenings.  Most of the dishes are small tapas plates so it's a great place to go, order a bunch of different dishes and share with your pals.  Between four of us, we had:Bread, cheese spread, green olives (free appetizer);Roasted eggplant cannelloni (with goat cheese and tomato sauce);Tuna tartare (with mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado and taro chips);Manchego mac 'n' cheese (baby shells baked with cheese);Empanadas (pastry stuffed with roast pork and red pepper, served with salad and aioli);Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (we got 2 orders);Filet mignon sliders (mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales cheese and caramelized onions) (we got 2 orders);Crispy duck rolls (with cherry hoisin sauce);Firefly fish sticks (fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs and spicy tartar sauce);Chorizo clams (peppers, two kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts)Everything was great, but my favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls and chorizo clams.  I guess I'm down for just about anything with chorizo in it.  Not only was the taste of the dishes great, but the presentation was fantastic too.  It's the kind of food you look at and even if you don't like something in it you can't wait to try it because it looks so good.The price was reasonable, with most tapas dishes costing between $5 to $10 each.  The four of us were stuffed afterwards and the total including tax, tip and drinks came out to about $120.  I'd definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas.
5	This is probably the only restaurant in town that you can eat at multiple times and consistently never be disappointed.  The menu is large and never gets old.  The crowd is young and when you sit down in the restaurant it's very cozy and has a pulse unlike any other restaurant in Vegas.  Food is amazing... Sangria is amazing! The price is great and the memories are plentiful.
5	I loved this place.  Great sangria, great atmosphere, great food.  I am very picky about food and service because well, I am in food and service.  Staff was helpful, even had to change my reservation too a later time because the first part of my night was not on schedule and they were accommodating.  Ham and cheese croquetas, Kobe beef sliders, and stuffed dates were amazing.  Great beet salad and just an al around good time.  They made my birthday fun, special, and not super expensive.  Amazing.
5	Had to update my review... Went last night with a friend in town that wanted to try the place I was hyping up all week LOL. We were seated right away around 8 and by 9 the place was packed (as usual). Our waitress was fast and we got our olive and bread app along with my stuffed dates (amazing) nice and fast. Tried the ahi skewers and the steamed mussels in red curry and coconut cream for the first time, both were great. My buddy had the 14oz Ribeye w/those wonderful firefly sig fries. Another A+ dinner.
5	One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable, service is great, and the ambiance is trendy.  Some of the items on the menu to try: Red Sangria, stuffed dates, and crispy duck rolls.  Each of these items is fantastic!  I also recommend the house made infused vodka on the rocks.  A reasonably priced and great tasting drink.  If you are looking for a trendy but unpretentious place off strip to have dinner, I highly recommend this restaurant!
5	Love Firefly! Good sangria and excellent tapas! We typically get the eggplant, steak & mushroom skewers, calamari, stuffed dates and the roasted red peppers along with a few others... The quality is consistently very good and the service is quite good as well. This is one of our favorite places to go and take along family & friends for the experience as well. Highly recommended!
5	One of my favorite hang-out spots in Vegas!  My friends and I been loungin' at Firefly since 2005 and I have nothing but praises to say.  Sangria and Mojitos are smooth plus their calamari and paella are delicious.  As I said, I have nothing but praises!!
4	Sangria was super refreshing. Choice of red, white, or sparkling. $6 a glass or $24 for a pitcher. Mojitos are good too. The flavored ones are $.50 more, but 1/2 off during happy hour! Bacon wrap dates with smoked almonds and blue cheese was my favorite dish! Free bread and olives for starters! Great service too. A great place to dine besides the strip!
4	Thanks to a local friend of mine, we went to the Firefly for dinner one night. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! We got a pitcher of Mojitos, and they were WONDERFUL! It is an awesome place to lounge, very nice lighting and date-friendly environment. We enjoyed the Filet mignon sliders, Crispy duck rolls, and the steak and mushroom skewers! By far, the Filet mignon sliders were the best, absolutely amazing!
4	Delicious food, friendly service, scrumptious drinks...my party of 5 loved this tapas bar.   Visiting Las Vegas, I was on a quest to try some new places there...so we checked out Firefly of Paradise. Happy Hour was great! I tried a few drinks on the menu.  We ordered a ton of food. Each of us had very different tastes, but everyone was very pleased with all the choices. Some favorites...bacon wrapped dates - a must try, Terra y Mare, Chorizo clams, Plate of Serano ham and Manchego cheese.  Prices were great. 5 people, half the table drank alcohol - bill was just under $100 before tax - with dessert, and tons of food! DESSERTS: previous reviews listed complaints about the desserts, which is why we ordered the dessert platter. I wanted to see for myself. Everyone at the table tore that plate up!  There's something for everyone, nothing was left behind. The flan was especially delicious!
4	WOW, I really needed this meal.  After driving 9 hours or so from the bay area overnight and being stuck in the terrible traffic of las vegas blvd, I was starving.  The empanadas and tuna tartare were amazing!  Everything else I had here was more normal and what you would expect at most tapas places, but I was just dying for the food and rest, so they get a higher rating.Definitely a place to check out if you want tapas around the strip.
3	It was a warm evening in Vegas so we decided to take a walk down to the Bellagio and watch the fountain show. At first we thought maybe we'd eat in the Bellagio, but after looking around on Yelp we found this tapas bar with pretty good reviews. We hailed a cab and took the short ride to Firefly on Paradise. It was packed at 8:30pm, people outside waiting with drinks in hand, the bar jammed, all the tables filled with cheerful people. Looks like a happy place to eat and celebrate another great weekend with my girlfriend. So we check out the menu and literally decide to order 3/4's of the dishes offered. The waiter , who was a friendly soul tried to persuade us to only order half, we overruled him and said ("bring it on") we're hungry. I'm not sure if it was just to busy, but the food was just average, it almost tasted as if it had been prepared ahead of time. The breads weren't toasted, the lamb chops so so, serrano ham covered in peppers (big mistake), mussels and clams OK just not memorable. I can go on and on talking about the calamari, stuffed peppers, white anchovies (great) duck egg rolls, tuna tar tare, octopus and potatoes, but in the end Firefly on Paradise is just OK. Not terrible but far from a Lola Gaspar. After eating close to 15 dishes we thought it best to walk back to the hotel.
4	Its loud, dark and sexy. I like this place and with the right company it IS a blast. Not normally a tapas person  but i was very pleasantly surprised by it. The service is good although they forgot to bring everyone's coctails and we had to remind the waiter.Good stuff: albondigas, the artichoke dish, the mushroom pastry thing, all the mojitos obviously. I liked the pomagranate mojito but prefer the mango. Overall I can totally see coming back here.Plus they have a ton of vegetarian dishes for baby and if baby is happy im happy. If baby not happy, all hell breaks loose so nice job firefly on paradise. You kept the hell storm at bay.
4	This place has really good food period. It is all well priced, quickly made and extremely satisfying. The tar tar was absolutely delicious I recommend that Item first and foremost. The sangria is also super tasty. When coming with a large group just order and bunch of plates and have at it. Everything that we ordered was really good and all the plates were cleaned and glasses empty. Satisfaction at a good price and only a 10$ cab ride off the strip!!
5	This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!! It is usually pretty busy, especially on Fri and Sat nights but it is worth any wait time, without question.  The stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven.  If you come to Las Vegas I HIGHLY Recommend you put The Firefly on your list of must visits!
4	Newbie to vegas scene with love for tapas.Was yearning to find a great tapa joint, not too far away with a relaxing environment. This place was it!Good sangria like everyone had mentioned.Only tried the Red, but it was great. Ordered various dishes....Can't name specific dish that I loved the most, but everything was pretty good. It was 5 of us and the tab came out to be around 30$ pp including 2 pitchers of sangria + tip. We were all stuffed from tapas...good times. Comfy lounge chairs I prefer over table seating. Will go back with who ever is down for some tapas.
1	Tapas usually are Spanish specialties. Those are anything but Spanish. No taste or should I say all taste the same. Looks like they use the same sauce base for all. Yerk!.  No management either. Staff comes out of the kitchen with mouthful chewing on food and are constantly chatting. I went to the bathroom and this waiter was   leaning against the wall, behind my back, texting on his cell, while I was taking a leak. We left and no one said thank you or goodbye or anything whatsoever, not even the two little smarties at the host stand. I will NEVER go back and certainly not recommend it either. Avoid at all cost.
4	This is one of my favorite places to eat! Everything here is so delicious! The long wait and the loud noisy atmosphere is definitely worth it! The stuffed dates are absolutely amazing (and I can't stand bleu cheese!). The Serrano ham and cheeses, Thai beef salad, Ahi Tuna skewers and dessert sampler is a must! Friends, family, dates, this place is perfect for everyone!
5	I was lucky enough to be a part of a private wedding party at Firefly last week. Holly mother of all that is awesome this place is great! The atmosphere is Vegas lounge-esk and lets you sit back and relax while you're served tapas and drinks in a club like environment. We sampled almost every plate they offered throughout the evening and I was never let down. The stuffed dates will be the last meal I have before my dirt nap...seriously they were that good. The staff was super friendly and the bartenders were well trained. The blueberry vodka mojitos are incredible despite them being anything close to a traditional mojito. Nothing but love for this place and it's staff. You have to go here while you're in Vegas.
3	This place is pretty cool for tapas. They have A LOT of small dishes and I liked how they make their own sangria, and on the menu it says they marinate it for 3 days. it was pretty refreshing and delicious. I came with a large party so it was a little difficult to get full since everything is small plates. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, skewers, and the big bowl of chicken salad. Also since we were still hungry we ordered the herb roasted chicken which came with fries and devoured it.
5	I love this place! When I first moved to Vegas, this is where I had a little "Welcome to Vegas" din. Every time I want to snack on something REALLY AMAZING, I think of Firefly.My faves are: tuna peppers, shrimp ceviche, spinach salad, baked brie, paella, pulpo asado, artichoke toasts, and tuna tartare.*siiigh* I'm hungry just thinking about it!Oh, and you gotta order the sangria -- Pretty strong with lots of fruits -- MUST samps.
4	We ate here on one of the nights we were in Vegas and I am absolutely a fan of this place. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the wait staff was eye candy! I started with the bread, butter and olives they bring to the table for free. The butter wasn't regular butter it was kind of sweet. I think it had some kind of fruit in it and the bread was toasted in garlic. MMmm!We ordered a pitcher of Mango Mojito for the table. It was so refreshing. To eat I had the Roasted baby beet salad with mixed greens, goat cheese, toasted pecans, sherry vinaigrette. The falvors of everything came together quite nicely. Then I had the Patatas bravas which were roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli. So tasty and just the right amount of spiciness. After that I had the Merguez which is spicy lamb sausage and tomato-pepper confit. I was getting so full from the other dishes that I couldn't finish it even though it was so good. I also had to save room for dessert. Which is what I'm going to tell you about now. Banana-Nutella Sandwiches with Nutella Cream dipping sauce. Need I say more? Ok fine I will. Two slices of bread toasted with banana in between and then cut into four slices, then covered in Nutella and even more Nutella cream sauce served in a little dish to dip the already chocolate covered sandwich in. YUM!!!!Next time I come to Vegas, I am definitely eating here so I can try some more of their dishes.
3	I thought the food was pretty good. I have done alot of really good Tapas and this was just pretty good. These guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is. Too busy for me on the weekends I would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it won't be soon.
5	I LOVE this tapas place.. I wish they would open one in San Diego!  We ALWAYS come here at least once during our Vegas trips.  Here's the menu: (everything is great)http://www.usmenuguide.com/fireflymenu.htmlyou MUST try the Stuffed dates[bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese] it's delicious!The Paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage] is SERIOUS! they don't skimp out on any of the ingredients.  I also like the sparkling sangria (the pitcher is a great deal).the restaurant gets busy quick, they can definitely accommodate large parties but remember to call and reserve early.
5	YUMMM!  My friends and I ordered so many tapa dishes and each and every one was awesome.  Each dish was so flavorful and perfect.  You must also try their sparkling sangria...very good.  Not much more to say, but you must try!! It's off the strip, but a cab ride from the Palazzo was about $10.
5	We got to this place 20 minutes before it opened. The waiter let us in anyway. The interior design looks so much cheaper than the other firefly, but the food is quite beyond my expectations. Firefly fries (bluecheese on fries, very creative) is a must have. If you have any questions, just consult with the waiters there, their suggestions are more than helpful. Another thought: this place should be an alternative option for a Vegas night. Their drink selection is quite special.
5	Loved everything here.  Excellent service all around, atmosphere was decent, lots of people talking, enjoying themselves.The food was the best part, my favorite being the stuffed dates.  I could eat  a dozen or two of these.  It's a must order, and probably a reorder.Also, not to be missed is the chocolate 3 leches cake, I hated to share this.  My lovely friends were lucky to not have been stabbed by my fork.Next time in Vegas, this place is on the itinerary.
5	I heart this place! On our last trip to Vegas we needed a place that would be delicious, parent friendly, and not in a casino. I found Firefly on Yelp! and made a reservation on line (so convenient for those of us that dislike telephones). When we showed up around 10p on a Saturday night it looked like a night club with how many pretty people were lined up outside. I was a little nervous that perhaps me and my crew were a little too ahem...mature to have a nice time. I was so wrong. I went to the hostess station where I was greeted with a big smile. I told them that we had a reservation and they said - oh, you must be betsy. why...yes, i am. I was really impressed that they were ready for us on a busy Saturday night. That all pales in comparison to how impressed I was with the food though. We read over the menu while enjoying a pitcher of very tasty sangria. We ended up choosing some garlic shrimp, muscles, the mushroom tartletts, some thing with a sardine on it, and several other things. Everything was delicious and was presented beautifully. There were some things that I wasn't crazy about - but all of those things contain foods (like sardines) that in general I wouldn't eat unless a little tipsy. The waiter and other staff were very attentive and despite the club like atmosphere we felt right at home here. I would recommend this place to anyone and look forward to returning on my next visit to Vegas.
5	WOW the best tapas i've ever had! i first found this on yelp, and then we asked our hotel for a good happy hour place and he said FireFly! so i felt that we had to try this place. three of us ordered:+ Boquerones [Spanish white anchovies on toasts w/roast red pepper, yellow pepper vin]+ Sausage Plate [Four imported Spanish sausages, cornichons, capers, mustard]+ Tuna tartare [layers of mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips]+ Steak and mushroom skewers [grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction]+ Crispy duck rolls [cherry hoisin sauce]+ Pulpo asado [marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato] plus they gave us bread & olives to start with, and we ordered sangria, and other drinks. the best dish was the pulpo asado, and the one that was not outstanding was the tuna tartare. i would definitely come back here again! i love this place.
4	Had a great little dinner here with friends.  Worth more visits.  Keywords:  Fun, Eclectic, Off-strip, Tapas. We had (and I recommend all of these) Eggplant cannelloni w goat cheese. Pulpas (grilled octopus) to die for. Lamb sausage.  Tomato soup with brue grilled cheese.The dessert platter is a must:  lemon tart with flavor that exploded in my mouth; Tres leches was a choc cake soaked in cream; A little flan,  very nice;  and Little tartlets with pastry cream and fruit.Great prices and decent wine by the glass.
4	Found this place after talking to a girl in killer heels on a bench at the Venetian. She said that they closed late and the food was good so we decided to try it out. I am seriously glad we did because this was one of the best tapas bar I have ever been in. The atmosphere was cool and very red, and the food was delicious!! Everything we tried was awesome, and pretty economical. The portions were good, service was great. Overall it was a great experience. Will definitely be coming back here!!!
5	I heart tapas and Firefly does it perfectly. Low key but trendy atmosphere, good quality food and interesting dishes, and of course sangria!! All at the cheapest prices I've seen in a while. I think it's the perfect place for a night out with friends, wohout the touristy bustle of the strip.Here's what I ordered, and I honestly recommend all of it, but like others have said, especially the stuffed dates.  It's a combination on sweet and savory unlike any other!-stuffed date ($4) their must-try-roasted eggplant canneloni ($5) basic, but good-filet mignon sliders ($7.5) - well marinated beef and yummy onion strings!-tres leche cake ($5)...so moist..drool.
5	By far one of my favorite restaurants in town.  If I have not eaten at firefly in a few weeks I start to get cravings! If you want to try something different then the red sangria, which everyone gets, but I prefer the sparkling sangria made with apples and blueberries! Yum! Their mojitos are to die for! If you're a mojito fan, you HAVE to get the mango mojito! In fact you might as well order the pitcher while you're at it bc its that good! Wow! What to order:-Shrimp ceviche OMG- I cant come here and not order this! -Stuffed dates-Sounds weird, but a serious party in the mouth! Same as above I will not come to Firefly and not order this! Might as well order 2 while you're at it-Baked tetilla- Bomb cheese like fondue -Tierra y mar skewers- make sure you order it cooked medium-Empanadas- good and cheap-Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms- yummy cheesy chicken with a perfect chorizo flavor, not too oily-Stuffed peppers-sounds cliche but very good.  The peppers are served soft with a delicious mozzarela mixture inside-Filet- cooked medium with the white wine reduction, perfect and yummy! -The beet salad is surprisingly very tasty! (My mom loves beets and wanted to order this which i was a little if-fy about but turned out excellent!)-The albondigas are ok. There are much tastier things, but if you like meatballs-The sliders are good, but have a strong flavor-Firefly fries- Big group=good thing to order. Massive plate of garlic-y fries-Veggie empanadas-if you love mushrooms-Did i mention the stuffed dates? -Ham and cheese croquetas-I thought they were just ok, but my friend loved them, comparable to a mozzarella stick, sort of-Calamari-always a classic-Camarones a la diabla-if you like asian flavors-Desserts are all bomb-Caramel flan- excellent!-Chocolate tres leches! Chocolate twist on the classic! So yes if you're wondering I eat here all the time! Especially since I get off at midnight, me and my coworkers LOVE to come here for drinks and apps after work and chill! Awesome!
4	My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  Were were a bit surprised we had to wait over an hour for a table but sat at the bar and drank sangria until the table was ready. This place gets a good crowd.  I would give it a 5 star, but it was a bit on the rich and saucy side.  They must use a ton of butter and cream here. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the food.  We were stuffed and only spent about $30 on the food for the two of us.  Drinks added up a bit at $6 a pop for a sangria.  But it was still affordable overall. I would definitely go here again.
5	My next trip to Vegas I am definately coming back here! The food was delicious, the Sangria was the BEST, and it was cheap! I don't entirely remembered what we ordered after the Sangria's, but the filet mignon sliders were awesome, tuna tartare was tasty, tomato basil soup was good, and much more but I don't really remember. Overall experience: *****
4	Whenever I'm in Vegas, this restaurant will definitely be on my itinerary. Don't miss the empanadas. None better anywhere I've been! Their paella was fresh, authentically seasoned and reasonably priced. If the ladies' room had been in better condition, I'd have rated this restaurant a 5.
5	I lived in Vegas for 2 years and this was BY FAR my favorite restaurant hands down.  It's not too far off the strip but the vibe, music, people, waitresses, etc all mesh well.  Thursday night until Sunday, this place is always poppin' and packed.  But every time I've gone here, even on Monday's, this place seemed to be packed all the time.  Must have dishes are the Ham & Cheese croquetas, Stuffed Dates, Mac 'n cheese and a pitcher of Sangria.  Start off with Red and then try white or maybe the Mojito.  You'll easily spend 2 hours here with a solid group of friends or even a date.  Each plate looks just as delicious as the girls from Spearmint but you won't have to drop $200 to be satisfied.
5	I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!Every time my friends and I go to Vegas we always make it a point to go here. They have the best Sangria's i've ever tasted and their tapas foods are really good. I especially liked the filet mignon sliders, camarones, garlic fries and paella. The atmosphere in this restaurant is very chill, they have dim lights for those special first dates and comfortable couches where you can chit chat with your friends all night. One time I took my aunt's here for my stepmom's birthday and all of them got druunnk from the Sangria. You know it's a great place when your nearing-50-year-old-aunts are having the time of their lives! I'm not sure if they do reservations but in any case, come early! it's a very popular spot for the locals.
4	I decided to celebrate my 23rd (yay mee!) in Sin City again-- but this time we decided to be smart and look up places apres-arrival! Thank god we did because we absolutely loved Firefly on Paradise!The atmosphere was great, mango mojito was yummy and strong enough and food was delicious! Our favorites were the shrimp ceviche, thai beef salad and the fillet+shrimp+sausage (forgot the name!). The ahi skewers were a bit over cooked and the duck rolls were dry but over all the food was wonderful!Probably wouldn't be back anytime soon just because there are so many places in Vegas to try! But definitely recommending it for anyone looking for a place that is moderately priced, close to the strip and yummmmy!
5	Excellent tapas!  I am picky and I think I've tried more than half the menu and every dish has been outstanding.  The Sangria is also very tasty... I ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time I went!The line is usually out the door and parking is limited.  The restaurant is next to the popular Ruth's Chris Steak House and a few other restaurants.  Makes parking a hassle as the lot in front of the businesses gets filled quickly.  There is parking behind Ruth's Chris and a walkway from the back parking lot to the front but it is a bit hidden.  Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.
3	I'd have given this higher stars had I never eaten tapas before, which I have, in San Francisco and it's a lot better there. BUT. The prices are ridiculously low, except for the wine markup, which was 3x on the bottle we got, which I always consider just so inappropriate that it knocks a half point off my restaurant reviews.The food itself was pretty good, especially the eggplant canneloni that had the perfectly roasted eggplant skin. The manchego mac-and-cheese could have used a tad more salt and the mac could have been just a little bit chewier, though on the whole it was a good example of the whole let's-play-around-with-comfort-food genre. The aioli wasn't really up to snuff, which made the patatas bravas a little sub-standard. The real winner on the menu was dessert, which I usually don't expect to be very good. But the tres leches was really moist and flavorful and the chocolate in the gelato was just the right level of dark with something floral in it.
5	This is hands down my favorite place in Vegas! I have been going here for about 4 years now. The service is very good and quick. The tapas are absolutely amazing. You can share them or just keep them all to yourself. The sangria is the best ive had and the infused vodka is made at the restaurant over a 2 week fruit marinating process. The atmosphere is very loungy and the staff knows not to rush you. They encourage you to sit around and relax. They play a graet eclectic mix of music. Being a DJ, I am very picky. If you like the paintings on the wall, they are for sale. The deserts are awesome. I highly recommend the tres leches. I have brought hundreds of people to this place including my mom who is never satisfied anywhere and she wont stop asking me about this place. Everyone loves the place and so will you.
5	excellent food, excellent wine selection! staff not very knoweldgeable at times but theyre very nice to make up for it!
4	TAPAS! I used to go to Vegas every year for New Year's, and we would inevitably end up here. Why? Because it's gooooooooood!!I'll be honest, it's been a few years and my memory is hazy on all the details and what is good and not good, but I do recall with perfect clarity how much I loved the croquettes here.  Every where I eat now and see croquettes on the menu, I order them in hopes that they will match the sublime satisfaction I always encounter with Firefly's, but alas, I have yet to find ones that match.  The staff is also always accommodating  to our ridiculous needs to have a large 20+ party (ha, I guess they know we'll spend lots of monies on the booze). Firefly's is great for food and for large groups to convene.  You can never go wrong with a group of friends and several pitchers of delicious sangria... or can you??
3	I have a special love for this place.  It's extremely tasty, and a really good medium between casual and formal dining.  Want to go out someplace after a show, but you can control the price?   Good place to go.  Want someplace to meet a friend for lunch.  Good, too.Only downer is the lack of gluten free and vegetarian options.  Being a tapas restaurant, you need as many options as you can get with your petit portions.  As for Vegas's normal vibe, this is a different change of pace.The tomato soup is really yummy.  Make sure you make reservations.
4	For four people, we ordered 13 plates, which arrived briskly with a smile.  Service was prompt, and the food rather flavourful.  Price point was excellent, especially considering the two pitchers of Sangria and two additional beers we had ordered.While there were left overs (especially the paella), we did enjoy the food soundly.
4	New Year's Day and came here for a very late lunch. With the hubby and bro in tow, we ordered several plates to share and waited until 3pm to order the lemon-lime mojito which at HH prices, was half off for a pitcher. Our server was very friendly and accomodating. He recommended several plates which he explained in detail. Such a nice guy and really very attentive. We ordered the stuff dates (2 plates), boquerones, tuna tartare, stuffed peppers, terra y mare skewers, and 2 pitchers of lemon-lime mojito. My faves are:-stuffed dates- who doesnt love lots of cheese and crispy bacon? It was so good I had to have 2 orders-stuffed peppers- garlic cream cheese and mozzarella stuffed inside a red pepper with tomato sauce-boquerones- spanish white anchovies on toast with roast red and yellow peppers. I nver had anchovies before, but this was suprisingly good. It had a nice balance of acidic flavors.just ok:-the terra y mare skwers- it just tasted like ordinary skewered beef (tough) and shrimp (tasty). The mojito pitcher is usually $28 but at HH prices, it was only $14!!It was sooo good and very refreshing with the loads of yummy mint that we ordered another. MMMMMmmm...this was a great first meal for 2010. And you bet, I will be coming back for more.
5	When it comes to tapas in Las Vegas, no one comes close to FireFly on Paradise. From the Sangria to the stuffed dates to the lines that stretch out into the parking lot, you will known when you have arrived at Las Vegas's best kept secret. Personal favorites are: -Pitchers of Red Sangria (If you order one for yourself, make sure you have a taxi standing by :)-Stuffed dates-Shrimp Diablas-Empanadas -Pretty much the rest of the menuThe only thing I have to warn everyone about is that this place can become very busy at night and especially on the weekends. Plan ahead with reservations or try and grab a seat at the bar. If you do end up having to wait, grab a drink and enjoy the energy that flows through the restaurant as the night goes on.
5	This restaurant is completely amazing! The selection and portion of food is perfect, sometimes you go to tapa's places you get A shrimp with your order or if you are vegetarian there aren't any options. At Firefly they have it all- Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Veggie. . .Some of my favorites are Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Spinach Salad, Stuffed Dates (TO DIE FOR), Diablo Shrimp-Truly have never had anything bad there. Also, the Sangria and Mojito's are phenomenal, but I will have to say, they made a damn good Dirty Martini!  Great place for a date, girls night out or starting point for a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. . . . Get there early though it get's busy!
4	Tried this place out since high ratings on Yelp and it was on Food Network as one of the top places for great food at great prices.  As most have mentioned the stuffed Dates were amazing (I was a little hesitant to try - but certainly was worth it).  We also had the Artichoke Toast, Ham & Cheese Croquetas, Camarones Ajillo & Terra y Mare Skewers.  Our favorite was the Terra y Mare Skewers.  I am not a shrimp fan but the Camarones Ajillo was our 2nd favorite with a great sauce.Service was great and very helpful to assist us on first time visiting.  We did make reservation ahead of time just in case and it was a great experience overall to dine at this place.If you are in the area this is a great place to eat and you have to try a little bit of everything.  Overal for the 5 plates, 2 drinks & 2 desserts our meal was $50.  I believe this is a great price for the quality of the food with the great service.
4	This place make one of the best sangrias. We happened to sit in the lounge area 10 minutes before 6pm and our waiter told us about their HAPPY HOUR which means many of the drinks are a half price until 6pm. Therefore, we ordered a bottle of red wine to take an advantage. Among what we had, we liked CEVICHE OF SHRIMP ($8.50) and STUFFED DATES ($4).
3	Stuffed dates and artichoke toasts. It doesn't get any better. Tried a number of other dishes, haven't had luck with any seafood dish. Poorly cooked everytime. Others are decent. Chicken can be bland and queso was pretty greasy.
2	The food was pretty good, but it wasn't *that* great of a deal... and the place is really, really LOUD and full of annoying local Vegas singles on the prowl.  I guess this is where you go if you're even marginally "artsy" or "cosmopolitan" (by Vegas standards, that is) and want to pick up on other similar types.  Whatever!  I just wanted some bad ass tapas in a chill atmo, and this was NOT it.  I much preferred Cafe Deia out  in the 'burbs.
5	This is my favorite place to grab dinner in my hometown. Nothing can touch it. I have had everything on the menu and never had any serious complaints. The atmosphere is awesome. Firefly has a Latin lounge feel and is full of vibrant people Just to confirm the other Yelpers cries, YOU MUST EAT the bacon-wrapped dates. They are delicious. Prices are reasonable and I always make sure to grab at least one pitcher of their amazing red sangria. It blows any others away. I am always in search of better sangria and I found Firefly's only competition in Barcelona -- It's that good.This is a perfect venue for a first date. Bad time: Call it at after a couple plates Great time: Keep the pitchers coming, make sure to finish it off with Tres Leche Cake. Perfect end to a perfect night.
4	Off the strip little lounge atmosphere is a big relief from chain and corporate hell in Las Vegas.   It has a local feel that was a treasure in sin city.  Have cocktails, have snacks, come on a night where they have a DJ, and feel a little more human off the strip.
5	This is one of the best (somewhat) hidden gems in Las Vegas.  Word seems to be getting out about this place as they have recently expanded.  You will still find mostly locals in this off-strip establishment.  They have excellent red and white sangria and tapas.  But the best part about this place is the atmosphere.  It does not feel like Vegas.  This restaurant could easily be in an urban setting such as SF or NYC, or even beach side in Southern California.  It definitely has that appeal.  I would highly suggest this place for just a relaxing place to hang out, grab a drink, and some tapas.  Reservations are highly suggested.
4	Excellent Tapas Menu. Pretty chill atmosphere. Everything was moderately priced. Thoroughly satisfied. Ordered the smoked salmon on toast. Which made me realize my diet is akin to that of a grizzly bear. Anytime I see smoked salmon I order and devour.   Whatever!  Salmon is the shit and is packed with omega 3s. Blood Red Mojito hit the spot. Not sure if they used blood red oranges or not, I am inclined to say they did...
4	Loved the stuffed dates! The atmosphere was a refreshing change from all the hotel restaurants.
4	Not to be confused with the Firefly Lounge in Studio City, CA.  Firefly in Las Vegas is a nice place. Went to the city of sin for a business dinner and came back a few hours later. Firefly was a good choice. The tapas our group had were the tilapia, the spanish tortilla, the pork empanadas, the tuna tartar, and I believe the chicken skewers. Didn't have any drinks that night, so I can't rate the sangria or the mojitos. The food, however, was pretty good. Nice decor. Good staff. Would recommend !
5	@FireflyLV on Paradise has long been known as an OFF the STRIP hotspot with hundreds of reviews,photos and news articles about it. Recently they opened a 2nd location at the Plaza in downtown Las Vegas and it has received an ever BETTER reception if that is possible. The view downtown seems to be all the rave:) My visit was around 7pm on a Thursday night since I've seen the crowds here on the weekend I wanted to avoid a long wait and I was delighted to be seated immediately. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time eating & drinking. We ordered filet mignon sliders, fries, some lamb chops and the waitress recommended the bacon wrapped dates!!! No drinks this time The menu has a nice selection of tapas all priced very reasonably and the food is presented like those other higher priced chic places;) The food was incredible, the dates are fantastic, wrapped in bacon with crumbled bleu cheese in a red wine reduction. Soooooo Good I had 2 orders:) The lamb chops were great, cooked perfectly medium-rare in a nice wine reduction sauce with julienned veggies and capers. Really I could have ate 10-12 of the lamb chops and been good. The sliders I didn't like the cheese sauce I could have done without-maybe some dijon mustard instead-the filet mignon burger didnt seem any different than any other sliders Ive had. I like the crispy onion straws but I'll skip the sliders next time. The fries were good-nothing spectacular just fries with grated cheese. I'd like to see some truffle fries or something;) The dessert was outlandish-Chocolate and cherry bread pudding[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream] -I could have ate another one. It was a TOUGH choice between the bread pudding and the Banana-Nutella sandwiches[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce] which the table next to us was enjoying:) My overall experience was fantastic the service was fast,friendly and quite helpful. The food was good. The atmosphere was fun & comfortable. When I left iasked the hostess if I could present the manager with something She looked at me a little strange but came back with the manager who was quite pleasant and accepted the TOP RATED RESTAURANT(#3) on Urbanspoon I gave him-telling me it would be given to the right person. UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise it has been placed in the menu marquee right outside the front door:)
4	happy hour til 6pm! woohooo! all drinks half off!we had the white, red AND sparkling pitchers of sangria. YUMMM-O! my favorite was the white and sparkling.  they dont put overly excessive amount of fruits in the sangrias like some places do which makes drinking them much better than eating our drinks.good foods:- paella- tuna tartare- stuffed mushrooms- meat empanadasfree - bruschetta with olives and some sort of cheese spread.i LOVE the ambiance and the casual seating in the lounge. its a dark, romantic and cozy place. price is not too bad but expect to pay between $4-10 per tapa dish....could be more for the obvious pricey dishes.  location is a bit hard to find since they dont have huge flashing signs.*featured on food networks "$40 a day"*
2	this tapas spot came highly recommended by a co-worker.  i try to support smaller establishments, so we opted to come here instead of the bigger restaurants on the strip.  big mistake.  we had the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, potatas bravas, lamb skewer, and petit filet -- all were a huge let down.  the tuna tartare looked like cat food.  i've never eaten cat food before, but i'm sure this is what cat food tastes like too.  the whole thing was one ill-seasoned heavy, lumpy mess.  i'm on a low sodium diet, and even the tiniest bit of salt is like a little bit of heaven in my mouth.  i tasted no salt at all.  the thai beef salad was okay.  i enjoyed the acidity and flavor that the tuna tartare was so lacking, but it was so oily.  the potatas bravas weren't crispy at all.  the lamb skewer was a tiny little thing, sitting on a bed of mung beans.  i must say that the mung beans were very tasty, although i'm sure they weren't meant to be more enjoyable than the skewer itself.  my husband had the petit fillet, so i can't say anything about that, other than the fact that he said it was "fine."  i had the sparkling sangria.  very good, but not enough to get me to come back here...ever.the inside of the restaurant was festive.  the waiter did his job.  there was a spanish tv station, interviewing patrons as they ate.  i found this very irritating.
5	This place is pretty awesome!  It was my first Tapas experience as well as having Sangria throughout my dinner.  We stayed there for a good 2.5 hours!What we ordered:-Pomegranate Mojito: strong....but good!-PitcherSangria ;) - super yummy and good buzz!-Firefly flies - yummers..keeps the buzz at bay. haha-Steak and mushroom skewers - delish! not too well done..just right!-Stuffed Dates - kind of different...sweet and salty!-Banana Nutella sandwiches - YUMMY!  I love nutella and I love bananas...great combination!-Tuna tartare...I've had way better.  Good, but could taste more freshI think this is a great interactive restaurant where you can share tapas with everyone at your table.  Kind of like Chinese dim sum, but the plates are much larger with a much bigger serving.  And Tapas is spanish. LOLI thought it would be quite expensive, but the price was just right and well worth it.  Great atmosphere, great strong drinks, and fantastic food to tantalize your palate!Go now, with great people, and have a great time!
5	Every time I am in Vegas, we wind up here....which is such a good thing.  It is more of a townie place, not trashy though, it just gets you away from he annoyance of the strip.  The mjoitos are scrumdiddly.  And it is hard to say what is the best dish to have here, there are so many.  Something as simple as the Parmesan fries with aioli are amazing.  Any of the skewers are awesome!  Stuffed dates, yeah!The room is usually filled with hotties too!
4	Fun place is all I have to say. This the perfect spot to meet up with friends close to the strip. I love the little dishes--fairly priced, and nothing tastes out of whack. The sangria quality has gone down a bit (actually a bit watered down) , but what the heck when you're among good friends in a lively atmosphere you can let it pass. Favorite dish: the bacon wrapped dates with feta cheese! Favorite drink: bloody orange sangria Great group spot! Latest update: Firefly's must do something about its cleanliness. I came here couple of days ago to introduce new friends to the establishment. It's old and smells putrid. Don't get me started on the ladies room and lounge chairs. I'm sure the restaurant has been getting by from its sheer popularity, but PLEASE clean up and sterilize. I think it's starting to turn off my appetite.
5	awesome little tapas joint off strip. i'll let the food speak for itself on this one. red sangria- even the boys liked it and you know how picky they can get when it comes to "fruity" drinks.  *tuna tartare - mango, doused in sauce...the tuna itself wasn't that fresh....but when there's that much sauce all you get its the chewy texture*eggplant cannelloni w/ goat cheese - there's a lot of cheese in this one w/ the egg plant, so if you're not a fan of goat cheese...pass*stuffed peppers- eaten w/ a crisp for a bit of a crunch. wasn't too memorable though*machengo mac and cheese- favorite of the night. loved how they used shells instead of the typical noodles...and the cheese had an awesome consistency. *heart**chrispy duck roll- sauce was so overpowering i wouldn't have known there was duck in it*tomato basil soup with brue grilled cheese- the soup had a strange aftertaste...i couldn't get past one spoon full. the brie grilled cheese was good though. *paella- its awesome here. try it!dessert: *flan- more eggy than usual, but i love egg tarts so it was fine by me*bread pudding- delicious esp with the melting ice cream *mini passion fruit cheesecakes- it was a little on the dense, but not overly sweet.
4	I went here with my bestfriend  who's local to Vegas about a year ago and she raved about this Spanish Tapas place.  I was like what's Tapas?!  Little did I know it is a gem of a place that plenty of people know about.  Keep in mind it is a bit off the strip. I recently went there to take my boyfriend for Vday so he can understand why I rave about it so much.  The consensus is right he absolutely loved the portions (hence "Tapas") and the infusions of flavor from every dish we tried.  I like the aioli sauce it's a kicker!  Of course you can't try everything in one sitting, but I have continued to get the filet mignon sliders and the red sangria pitcher.  It's a good balance of fruit and alcohol and it's marinated 3 days prior.  Bravo!!!My advice if it's around dinner time definitely make reservations via phone or opentable.com otherwise you'll be waiting for quite a loooooooonnnnnggggg time.
4	I found this place through yelp and I have to agree with all the recent yelpers. Overall good food...I sampled:My two favorites dishes were:Camarones a la diabla (shrimp in a spicy savory sauce)Pulpo asado (grilled octopus)Were just ok:Crispy duck rolls (pretty good- sauce was a little sweet)Manchego mac n' cheese (needed just a little more salt)The food came out a little slow. We were there for almost 2 hours and we only had 4 tapas sized dishes.  Normally that's fine with us but we had a show to catch. Actually, our waiter forgot to put one of our dishes in- but as a bonus, he got it for us asap and it was on the house.  So he won us back with that!   I just went there this past friday- I was worried about not getting a table so I arrived at 6PM and there was some room, but by the time we left, it was packed. I am definitely going back again though.  Vegas needs more of these types of restaurants!
5	My best friend took me here on my bday and I had SO MUCH FUN.  Of course we walked in with like a shit load of hot girls, dressed to impress...So wherever we go it'll be a fun time lol.  5 pitchers of mojitos later.....EVEN FUNNER TIME!  The food is so delicious and perfectly sized portions.  LOVE this place.  It's my mandatory stop every time I'm in town...
5	We got in pretty late from Orange County on a Friday and decided to skip the obligatory In-N-Out stop in Barstow to try a late night joint in Vegas. I spent most of the car ride yelping on my phone (and no, I wasn't driving) and decided to give Firefly a try. It had good yelp reviews plus I remeber seeing Rachel Ray go there so figured it would be a good option.I was a little hesitant to try a tapas place since I was afraid the small portions would be too much of a tease and my husband is pretty opposed to anything "hip" such as the tapas trend but all I needed to know is it had three of favorite things in the world- gazpacho, Nutella and mojitos and I was sold.We got to Firefly shortly after midnight and I was pretty surprised to find it almost completely full. Since we were expecting pretty small portions, we ordered wayyy to much for 2 people. We ordered:---Gazpacho- very good flavor, but i prefer it a little thicker. Perhaps I'm used to Gazpacho at Spago.---Firefly fries- very good, good flavor/seasoning. Wayyy bigger portion than expected, plenty for 4+ people to share. The two of us couldn't finish it.---Filet mignon sliders. Soooo good! My husband's favorite dish of the night. 2 pretty big sliders, each close to the size of a regular McDonalds burger. Will definitely be ordering this again.---Empenadas- Weakest dish of the night. Not bad but didn't compare to the other things we ordered. Kinda weird flavor, maybe cause I don't normally order pork.-Baked tetilla- sooo good! I'd say its comparable to a similar dish I've had at Mesa grill. Gooey flavorful cheese, how can you go wrong with that?---Nutella/ banana sandwiches-all i can is yummmmm. No joke one of the best things I've ever had but as I've stated before, I love Nutella. The dipping sauce plus the sandwich somehow just works wonders to my taste buds. I tried to describe it in a coherent way but words fail me. All I could think was that it had 3 different dimensions of goodness. Definitely a winner to end a great mealI also had a passionfruit mojito which was pretty good and strong and the red sangria which was pretty good as well. My husband ordered 3 beers and they accidentally brought him an extra they didn't charge for. All together our bill was around $80 which considering the amount of food or drink we had, I would say it wasn't too bad. A similar meal on the strip would probably be twice the price. The service was pretty good and quick. Dim lighting and surprisingly good acoustics. Fun, hip atmosphere. I will definetly be back again. Next time I will try the bacon wrapped dates for sure and I will be ordering the nutella sandwiches everytime I come here without a doubt!
4	I really don't venture out East of the Nile (LV Strip) because it REALLY feels like I have to navigate myself through the river of cars to get to Firefly. But it is worth it. I've seen comments of this place being better than Cha Cha Cha of San Francisco but to me it is not as great. There is definitely a wider selection of tapas here than triple "C" but the flavors are not as on point.  I like the creativity of the ingredients here but all dishes all lack  the right amount of seasoning. Salt, pepper, chili, acid !! Stick to those basics people. Definitely great for large crowds, order large pitchers of Sangria and Mojitos and have a blast! Don't be too dependent on the food because they tend to come out in waves.  If you miss the wave, you will be suffering....
5	At this place the food is tasty. You can tell they really pay attention to detail. They prepare their  food with love. This place is always busy no matter what nite, I recommend you make reservations. All the sangria's are good and they will give you a good buzz. You gotta try the stuffed dates, garlic shrimp, and my fav the steak and mushroom skewers.
4	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love introducing friends to it.  The tapas style menu makes it great for small to medium sized groups.  You also get a lot of variety for a very reasonable price.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and this is my list of favorite dishes and the ones I'd pass on.Favorites:Artichoke toasts- My boyfriend who doesn't even like artichokes, likes this one.Stuffed Dates- Great flavors and textures.  The sweetness from the dates and saltiness from the bacon and blue cheese are such a wonderful combination.  The red wine reduction really brings it all together and the almond adds a nice crunch.Albondigas- Just well done meatballs in marinara.Ham and cheese croquetas- Fried meat and cheese, it's a little hard to go wrong there.Merguez- A flavorful lamb sausage served with red pepper and tomato confit.  The sweetness from the confit compliments the slightly spicy sausage nicely.Firefly* fish sticks- Fried tilapia fillets with a great texture and usually perfectly cooked.  (Once when they were busy, the fish sticks came out over cooked.)Fried calamari- Well done calamari served with a garlic aioli.  The aioli can be a bit pungent, but not enough to deter me from this dish.Camarones a la diabla- Shrimp in a sweet and slightly spicy Asian influenced sauce.Passion fruit mini-cheesecakes- The passion fruit flavor just explodes in your mouth; perfectly tart and sweet.Pass on:Tuna peppers- Tuna salad stuffed in marinated sweet peppers.  The tuna salad was nothing special, and the peppers were a tad too sweet for this application.Stuffed peppers- Little peppers stuffed with cheese and topped off with a tomato sauce.  This dish was boring compared to the others.  It reminded me of not good Italian food.Crispy duck rolls- Let me start off by saying duck is one of my all time favorite foods.  With that said, these were a complete disappointment.  The filling in the rolls was so overpowering you could not taste the duck.  It really tasted like a bad egg roll.  On another occasion my friend, who also loves duck, ordered these and agreed they were not very good.Paella- This was edible, but certainly nothing to rave about.  It was missing that nice crust on the bottom of the pan, and the texture of the rice was a little too sticky for paella.If you are near the strip and want Tapas, I would suggest Firefly* over Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.  The food and prices are better.  If you are looking for a pitcher of tasty sangria, choose Ba Ba Reeba over Firefly*.  Ba Ba Reeba adds hard liquor to their sangria for a nice kick to compliment the sweet fruity beverage.
5	When I got married two years ago my husband and I opted to have a "reception" the day after our wedding at a restaurant that would leave our wedding guests happy. Let's face it, wedding reception food almost always SUCKS. Why torture your friends and family when they've spent their hard earned money to travel from places near and far with rubbery chicken or bland side dishes served out of tin foil, probably made 47 hours before your event?That's where Firefly stepped in. They closed the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon to accommodate for our large crowd of 125 hungover guests. They gave us a gigantic selection of food to offer to everyone, and made sure that pitchers of mojitos and sangria were placed on each of the tables. Ultimately, we ended up giving everyone a choice between Steak Frites, Herb Roasted Chicken, or Vegetarian Paella. When everyone arrived, we were pleased to see more than enough servers to take care of us. We were given the standard bread and sweet butter with olives, and the entrees were on the tables within 30 minutes or so. The kicker is that we spent less than $30 per person on all of it. Since then, I return to Firefly every single time I go to Vegas. I've happily tried every small plate on the menu, and I always enjoy the sangria because it's not syrupy and not overwhelmingly sweet. My favorite tapas are:Firefly FriesPork EmpanadaPetite FiletHam & Cheese CroquetasManchego Mac n CheesePatatas BravasStuffed DatesI typically order twice as many plates as our table needs, and somehow have never managed to spend over $75 during any visit. If you're looking for a place where the locals go, go to Firefly on Paradise. Get off the strip and have some tapas!
3	The three star rating is definitely qualified, and here's why. These sorts of places are relative. If you've ever eaten really good tapas where they're more likely to show up naturally, say, San Francisco, LA, NYC (and especially if you've ever roamed Spain), this place is definitely sub par. It's not that it's terrible, but more like the kind of tapas you'd get if you sent a recipe to a reasonably skilled cook in Milwaukee and said, let's see what you can do. The results are competently assembled, but utterly lacking in comparison to more authentic counterparts. So two stars, maybe. (Maybe.) On the other hand, if you've never been near a tapas restaurant and so far life has offered little more than Appleby's or Olive Garden, you might want to drop by here to get an idea of what tapas are. This might start you out on a journey to find the ones that are consistently nothing short of wonderful. Good luck.
5	I really like this place. I try to visit this place every time I'm back in town. The food is great and the prices can't be beat. Its open pretty late, but it can get packed pretty quick, but its defintely worth the wait. Service is okay, its better than average. The bacon wrapped dates are amazing, the flavor combination is great. The mac and cheese was pretty plain, I think it lacked flavor. Patatas bravas was so good, especially when they serve it with that sauce. The sliders are also a must try, the texture and flavor go very well together. The atmosphere of this place can get pretty loud, but its still a great eatery.
5	By far one of my favorite places to dine in Vegas! It may not have a celebrity name attached to the restaurant but the food is always delicious and the staff super friendly! It's a great place to take friends and don't forget to get a pitcher of sangria!Favorites include:Eggplant & goat cheese cannolisBacon wrapped datesBeef Thai saladCevicheand Kobe beef sliders!Can't wait until I can say I've tried them all!
5	I went here on the recommendation of a local buddy, and it was CROWDED. But that's okay! We sat at the bar and talked with the bartender, and we were comfy and still got all of that AMAZING food. Honestly, it was all so good that it is kind of a blur of gluttony and satisfied drooling in my mind. I do remember getting the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates of course - DELICIOUS, but also something I make at home (VERY easy, try it yourself!), so if you know how to make these too then I would order other things. Basically I wanted to try everything on the menu! I also remember getting these cheese-stuffed red peppers, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms and camarones al ajillo. What can I say? This place made me happy. I would recommend this location over the newer downtown one because the downtown one has a limited menu. I live in LA and I have yet to find a tapas place here as good as Firefly in LV. Basically, I will now go to this restaurant every single time I visit LV, perhaps even more than once per trip. I'd rather pay to eat what I know will be great food than overpay for some mystery restaurant that may or may not be good. Drool....
4	Whenever I have visitors from out of town, this is one of my favorite places to take them. They have a variety of food for the meaty eater to the veggie eater and I have not yet received a complaint about the food. My personal favorites are the tuna tartare, the manchego mac and cheese and filet mignon sliders. This time I also ordered the steamed mussels, Terra y Mare skewers and the mushroom tart and all three items did not let me down at all. It may seem a lil pricey, but its definitely worth the money. P.S. I love their mojitos!
5	Firefly is the best Tapas restaurant I've been to yet! I was lucky to get to eat here two weekends in a row! I came last weekend for dinner w/ a group of 18, and then again yesterday with my girlfriends for lunch - both times we were seated promptly and the dishes came out quickly. I've probably tried 15+ tapas dishes here and they're all really tasty, under $10/each, and the portions are bigger than any other Tapas place I've been to. I think the sauces for the dishes here are what really make them excellent. Standout items on the menu would include: Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Camerones a la Diabla (Shrimp, Spicy Chile Sauce [SO GOOD], Grilled Bread), Stuffed Dates (Bacon-Wrapped, Smoked Almond, Red Wine Reduction, Blue Cheese), Smoked Salmon Toasts (Brioche Toast, Sour Cream, Pickled Ginger, Capers), Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, and the Steak and Mushroom Skewers. Don't forget to order a pitcher of their White Sangria (marinated for 3-days to enhance the taste).I wish there was a Firefly in the OC! Good thing my friends LOVE to go to Vegas ;)
4	One of the best Tapas restaurants ever!You must try the ceviche, beef thai salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, steak and mushroom skewers.  And the paella was filled with many mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken and sausage!  All of the dishes were so delish!  We also had a pitcher of sangria ... which was marinated for 3 days!Firefly's a must!
5	Very very good! Pitcher of mojito and an array of tapas under the heater on the patio = Perfect date night. We had about 6 different tapas to share and they were all wonderful. My favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, stuffed dates, and thai beef salad. Everything was delicious! I haven't tried the downtown location yet, but it's definitely on my list.
4	Love the food, like the drinks, hate the service is what this comes down to. After eating here dozens of times, I have yet to have any positive service experiences.. ever. While their drinks are pretty tasty, all their mojitos are made with juice concentrates rather than real fruit or real fruit juice. They are a little sugary sweet and artificial tasting for my palette, but to each his own ! The bacon wrapped dates are freaking incredible (they have the best ones in town!), and I also love their mac and cheese. Sliders are hit or miss. Skewers are just ok. I attached a pic of the white drink mixes they buy to put in all the drinks. I watched the bar for 30 minutes last night and didn't see one drink made without some concentrate out of a white canister.
4	The service was attentive and the wait was minimal.Food was mostly very tasty and also very affordable.Ambience very nice, but a little louder than one wants for a romantic evening.The (red) sangria was a little sweet for my taste, and the octopus was very tender but oddly mealy. Other dishes were good -- the dates were as tasty as promised, and the merguez (lamb sausages with red pepper) were fantastic.
2	Came here for lunch since all the rave reviews had made me very curious as to how good the tapas were.Armed with high expectation and an empty stomach, we were sat down right away since the place was nearly empty.Given the menu and a basket of bread to start with, the waiter showed up after 10mins to take our orders. We had pulpo, patatas bravas, steamed mussels,steak in skewers,stuffed mushrooms,somethng egg layered with potatoes.The taste was disppointing, Pulpo was too soft to the bite, it was tasteless. the bravas were burnt, mussels were served in coconut milk that is canned!!! UGH!!!Service was so so. Not attentive.Had to ask for refill 2x.I have truly experienced better.I also  noticed that all the tapas were topped with chopped scallions, onions,tomatoes.
4	I was designated as the planner for my friend's bachelor party, and was guided here by the yelp forums.  I decided to give them a call and before I knew it, I was already picking out menu items.  For the tapas banquet, it is all you can eat, and you can choose 6 items from their entire menu of tapas, except for the lamb chops.  We went with:Empanadas - good, but a bit filling..and the sauce is a little on the rich sideSteak and Shrimp Skewers - has a piece of sausage on top as well, very good, but their chimichurri sauce is a little on the salty sideAhi Tuna Skewers - the one thing we shouldn't have ordered, the tuna was a bit dry and did not mesh too well with the fruit it had on the skewerFilet Mignon Sliders - excellent, although some burgers had a bit too much sauce on them...also a major filler on the all you can eat...they kind of killed a few of us and ended our eating...haha...Spicy Shrimp - my favorite thing we ordered, delicious, sweet and spicy and cooked to perfectionMango Baby Back Ribs - these were a hit with everyone...numerous rounds of these...fall off the bone (baked I think for any bbq snobs out there)...with a nice mango glaze...i personally have had better ribs, but these are better than your average baby back rib you will get at a non-bbq joint...The service here started off very slow, and with a 22 man bachelor party, you could just feel the antsyness kicking in when there was no food or drinks for about 15 min.  However, once the food started coming out, the service went from 0-60 in about 5 seconds.  The wait staff got into their rhythm and it was smooth sailing the rest of the night.  We even had 5 stragglers who were already pre-paid for, show up about an hour late, and the staff accomodated them as if nothing was wrong.  This place is just OK for big groups, as they do not have private rooms or anything, but perfect for medium size groups of 10 or so.  It is also good for casual diners as well.  haha  The food is excellent and service is pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone out in vegas and would return.
4	This place was great.  Huge selection of food that will fit anyones tastes.   The mac and cheese was our favorite dish! If you like Tapas style food,then exit the strip and get to Firefly.
3	I have been here twice and both times I have been satisfied with the food. I personally think they have way too much on their menu making it hard for a first timer to make up her mind :). But the ambiance is very casual and relaxed.Most of the locals come here to enjoy tapas. They have a second room in the back which in my opinion has a better ambiance. The drinks are good - not watered down - and that's important in vegas :)
5	Another review update for Firefly and another perfect 10, or 5 in our yelp world.  I know that most of my hardcore friends here on yelp have some mixed reviews which is totally understandable.  However, I through different situations at these guys/gals and they always seem to pull through.  17.... Yes, 17 people at 8:00 for a birthday dinner! Guess what, we arrived at 7:55 and were seated at 8.  The service was some of the best I've ever seen.  I've been to this location numerous times and they were packed and just flying around the restaurant taking care of their patrons.  The food was all fantastic and the drinks matched perfectly.  For the money, its one of my favorite places to go and to take others along with me.  I cannot wait for a yelp event to take place at one of their locations.
5	Amazing. Great ambiance, fabulous food, and their drinks are to die for. Don't forget the stuffed dates. You won't be disappointed. Can't forget how affordable this place is. What are you waiting for?
5	I love this place, there are very few places like this in Vegas. It's a great place to go on a date and is so much fun. They have pitchers of sangria (red, white, or sparkling that has a little bit of peach liquer added to it with some champagne), pitchers of different kinds of mojitos, as well as your standard mixed drinks. They are reasonably priced (pitchers are $24) and the bartenders know their stuff and are personable. Their happy hour is amazing with half priced drinks and they give you a plate of complimentary tapas. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a great dinner place per-se (hello, tapas bar), but a great meet-up place and with a sexy vibe to get to know someone. The tables are a little awkward towards the back because they are so large that you're sitting a reasonable distance away from your date. It makes it hard to get cozy unless you sit next to them in the booth. The outdoor patio is awesome, and usually crowded. Service is hit or miss, i've had good experiences and a couple that were just okay. The quality of the food, drinks, and ambiance make it not so big of a deal though. Their bacon wrapped dates are to die for, and i'd definitely say it would be on the top of my list for favorite places to go in Vegas. A +++ for the bartenders, food, and energy of the place.
5	Got lost and tried to make it here on foot. Not a good idea! lol. Take a cab here. It is not walking distance off the strip. My very first tapas experience and my gawd! This place was amazingly good... the bread and butter that came before our late lunch was a little different than anything I've ever had. The bread was pre-oiled and garnished, served with whole olives and sweet butter. We started with stuffed dates (bacon wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese), chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, crispy duck rolls with cherry hoisin sauce, white sangria which was marinated for 3 days. Ended our late excursion with what else but the filet mignon sliders (mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales cheese, carmelized onions). The price was between $3.50-$10. Totally worth the prices on the small portions. You get a variety, which is why I love tapas. Word of advice: don't go off the beatened path. Many Yelpers listed the must-haves already. I would pass on the crispy duck rolls and go for another order of stuffed dates!
5	Incredible, try the sliders, ham and cheese crouquetes, stuffed dates, and anything else that looks interesting to you, can't go wrong.  The mojitos are delicious too and come by the pitcher if you want.  Just a great fun delicious place and for the prices you can't go wrong.  Every one I have ever taken here loves it and I have taken more than a few.
5	Awesome Place. I would definitely come here again on a return Vegas trip. Had an awesome time for a decent price. I was looking to spend a little cash, roughly $50-$75 for a classy meal (involving wine) @ 11pm on a Tuesday night! This is a harder task than it sounds. However, Firefly stepped up in a big way. My girlfriend still asks about the banana sandwiches. These guys are just of the strip and worth the trip. Open late!
4	This place has been responsible for the starts and ends of many of the most memorable nights in Vegas. Excellent tapas, Spanish-quality sangria, and great service.
3	Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to give this tapas place a try. I came in with a party of 12 or so not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised at the array of choices of their tapas menu along with the option of choosing entrees instead if tapas is not your thing.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large group-  points for that! For drinks I tried a blood orange mojito- very good and strong- another plus. Tried their sangria, equally good.For food, I opted to share the shrimp ceviche with a friend and ordered the machengo mac n' cheese and filet mignon sliders for myself. Out of the three I would have to say I enjoyed the ceviche the most. The sliders were a bit over cooked and although my friends all raved about the mac and cheese, mine failed to impress. It seemed as though the cheese in mine had coagulated while I was working on my sliders- bummer.One thing I found funny and a bit creepy (non related to their services/food) was a customer coming out of the bathroom and then sneaking a picture of us has he walked by. Awkward!Overall I would recommend firefly as a great place for drinks after work, not sure if they offer happy hour or not but this would be a decent place to go. Given the opportunity to go again I would be okay with giving the food a second try- perhaps  trying an entree next time...
5	Went here last night with a friend who has never been around 9:30 PM. Since we were only two people, we literally got in right away without a reservation. We got seated quickly, had enough time to peruse the menu before ordering, and the food came out quickly as well. We didn't have to ask for refills on our water or ice tea at all during the night, the only extra we asked for was of their sweet butter which the first batch melted very quickly. My friend ordered the stuffed dates and the lamb skewers, and she said both were very very good. I switched it up a little and got the veggies and lentils, tortilla a la espanola, and the warm spinach salad which was ridiculously delicious and at a very good price. For both of us to dine it was $18 each including tip. It was a ridiculously busy night so I was amazed at the quality of the service compared to the Plaza location. We even had a waiter switch and still the ball was never dropped. It was a very smooth visit which reinforces my belief that having a small party is the way to go unless it is a special occasion. Good job, Paradise!
5	Firefly has given me ANOTHER reason to LLLLLLOVVVVE Vegas even more than I already do. For those of you who make trips out to Vegas and don't eat at Firefly, you're missin out. It's on my to do list for every Vegas trip!!! Firefly is a Tapas restaurant, so the majority of their menu is a huge variety of Spanish appetizers. I could sit here and list everything we ordered and describe em, but honestly, I think the best way to do it is just order what sounds good to you... because that's what we did, and everythinggggg (seriously EVERYTHING) tasted AMAZING. Nothing can go wrong :) And of course, no Vegas meal is complete without some drinkkkks! hahah I recommend a pitcher of White Sangria...mmm so so so yummy.
4	Nothing better than ending a LOSING trip to vegas with some good eats.  My buddy use to be the former exec. sous at TAO, recommended this joint.  Cant believe it took me this long to try.  One of the better tapas places i've ever been....granted, my tapas tasting has been limited due to younglings.... anyhow...on to the food:Stuffed Dates:  Lived up to the hype.  Must eat all components together.  My first bite was without the blue cheese crumble, and it was eh...then the second one was HOLY SCHMOLY!  Very good... And i dont even care for dates.Chicken Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms;  Good...but no wow factor... they tricked me by printing "YUM" on the menu description.Calamari:  Very good....the garlic aioli was excellentTuna Tartare:  Fresh, cut too big, but nice cold app to go with alcohol.Paella:  MONEY MONEY MONEY.  Now this is good stuff.  Not too salty, plenty of shrimp, chicken, sausage, calamari, very very good.  ONLY minor glitch... i think because of the wait and the crowds, they served the dish in a cold paella dish.  The best part of paella is the crunchy part of the rice on the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise, this was first rate.White Sangria:  Only had a sip, but it was ok....better off with hard liquor or cold beer.Service was good considering the crowds.  Kinda hot though...the A/c wasnt on full blast.  Definitely worth another visit..... nice change of pace from the Overpriced strip eateries....
5	It is fantastic. I was brought here on a trip to Vegas a few years ago and was blown away by this place.  Whenever I go to an awesome restaurant, I stare at the menu wanting to order half the things on there.  Finally I could!! The Sangria was incredible as well.  In fact, I can't really remember what food I had on that first trip because the sangria was so good...anyhow.....fast-forward to last weekend....back in Vegas and back to Firefly. I was pretty worried as I was bringing someone new here and I had been hyping the place for the whole drive from LA and figured it probably had gone to shit over the past couple years like many restaurants do. Nope! It was awesome, again.Garden Salad = winMac & Cheese = winTetilla = winSteak & Mushroom Skewer = winBacon wrapped dates = winall that stuff totaled like $30, which I know I am biased coming from LA, but that is amazing. Now hurry up and open one of these in SFV!
4	Service: Great Food: Good Restaurant: Clean but they could stand to turn down the music 50 notches.Restroom: OKReturn Visits: YesFavorites: Pulpo asado, Gazpacho, Tres LechesI've been coming here for about 3 years. I used to be in love with this place but now, I'm just in LIKE with it. They have a lot of flavor in their food, that hasn't changed... It's their portion sizes, they seem to be getting smaller every year. I get it, hard 'economic times' but if you're going to charge the same amount, can I get the same amount? I'm suffering from this economy too?!Food, it's got lots of flavor. Gazpacho isn't for everyone, it's cold soup, but I like it! Pulpo asado is really good, just disappointed, as I stated earlier, the portions are smaller now. They used to pile that thing so high, now, it's almost the same size as the small tapas, no bueno. But the quality of the dish isn't affected, thank goodness. Tres Leches is bomb but, again, smaller than it used to be.Atmosphere is kaka, lol and is the reason why I knocked one star off. I mean, I like it when a restaurant plays music to take care of those "quiet" moments that can happen when you're having dinner and you run out of things to talk about BUT c'mon, I at least want to be able to hear my thoughts!!! It can be so ear piercing that sometimes I wish I was a lot more drunk so that I wouldn't be bothered by the music.Restaurant; there are several areas that you can sit: inside, inside the lounge-type area (which consists of couches and coffee tables as your dining area), outside and also their overflow part of the restaurant that is also indoors. Personally, I kinda of like the lounge area because that seems to be the only area that doesn't get as cramped as the rest of the restaurant. NOTE: Please don't ever go there at night and MOST especially on the weekends, without a reservation. You can wait 1-2 hrs just for a table of 2?! You'll be pissed. Usually on weekends, they have to open up their overflow portion of their restaurant that's usually closed during the week because it does get super duper busy on weekends. AND, since they get so busy, sometimes they try to stuff everyone into the restaurant that it can feel a little cramped.
1	how come this place still open. I will think because the people that come here have never try REAL TAPAS so they don't know the real flavor.This place is really bad. The restaurant sell tapas well let me tell you this  place  is not tapas plus the chef here need to go to Spain to learn how to cook some real tapas.   The paella was really bad no flavor, the sangria no good. No stars from me
5	This place is great.  If you are in Vegas for a couple days for business, or just for the night, definatly worth your time.  Great tapas, great service, awesome happy hour from 4-6 with half priced pitchers of sangria.  Perfect place to dine alone at the bar.  If you do not know what to order, ask one of the bartenders and they will guide you.
4	I ended my birthday food-feast at Firefly.  It was a perfect night filled with good friends, good sangria, and good food! (Well, the little that I tried after stuffing myself all day long.)The atmosphere of firefly is awesome, inviting, and perfect for a night out with friends! I will have to come back here more. The only food I have to rant about is, of course, the stuffed dates. I've had stuffed dates before, but BOY nothing beats these! Mmm.
5	I love this place.  We eat lunch here often.Food - During my most recent visit, I had:- Stuffed Dates...very yummy w/bacon.- Ham & Cheese Croquetas...one of my favs.- Vegetable Empinada....1st time trying it, was ok.- Stuffed Mushrooms...another one of my favs.- Firefly Fries.....you can't go here and not get these...they are addicting!The weather was awesome, so we ate on the patio....just a great experience.  Hard to find in Vegas.Service - The service here is always spectacular.  They are very attentive to your needs and make sure you're taken care of.Will I return?  Absolutely!
5	We took a party of 9 there last night and Firefly knocked it out of the park!!! Excellent service and the food was spot on. A couple of new things we tried were the warm spinach salad, excellent, and their desserts. The tres leches chocolate cake is phenomenal!
5	Ah, Firefly. Where do I even begin?Right. I begin with sangria, like I always do. Happy hour gets you half off sangria plus a free tapas. A pitcher during regular hours will be around $18 and should get two people through dinner at around three glasses each. They offer red, white, and sparkling sangria. I can't say I've tried any other than the red; why mess with perfection?A free bread basket is always good, especially when it comes with the amazing herb butter they make in-house. Olives are served on the side.The menu isn't huge but seems daunting. You absolutely have to read the titles and the descriptions of each dish. Does "Stuffed dates" sound appealing? Maybe it does, but the additional "bacon wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" can't hurt.Assuming you're a party of two, and you've waded through the menu, order at least three things per person. Of course, at happy hour for a snack, one item is perfect, but I'm talking dinner here. Some dishes that my other half and I never fail to order: Stuffed Dates (sometimes one order for each of us; an order gets you five), Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Manchego Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Tart, and Petite Filet. Some that are not always necessary but we love them: Patatas Bravas, Albondigas, Crispy Duck Rolls, and Steak and Mushroom Skewers. We probably end up with ten different dishes every time we go there.I would like to make it through the entire menu, but my go-to plates are so delicious that I'm only able to try one or two new things every time! Last time I did get the Crispy Duck Rolls for the first time, and I will definitely be getting them again. I haven't tried any of their five entrees, but I'm intrigued by the Paella and will try it soon.This is another do-not-skip-dessert place. There are very few places where I must have dessert; this is one of them. At least every second time I eat at Firefly, I order the Chocolate-Cherry Bread Pudding. Actually, desire would be a more appropriate word. I desire this dessert. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert, and this is one of the best I've ever had.Firefly has two locations. One is downtown in the Plaza hotel, with a gorgeous view of Fremont street from a big glass dome where most of the seating is. The other is on Paradise, near the Hard Rock, convenient for visitors from the Strip, with excellent ambiance and an outdoor patio. The food is excellent and the menu is the same at both locations.Parking is easy and free. Reservations are a good idea; they can be made via OpenTable.
4	Unfortunately this location has to lose a star because some things were just not up to par. I have to start by saying I love, love, love Firefly to the bottom of my soul but today was not the best I have had from them, but not the worst, either. Took my mom here for her first time and just a couple of the things were a bit "off". We started by ordering a pitcher of sangria which was not filled to its usual height (almost halfway down the pitcher!) and it only had apples and one slice of orange. That's it. No grapes, no other lovely fruits, just apples and one single slice of orange. Meh. It still tasted alright, but was not of the usual fruity goodness I have come to know and love. Usually I love digging through my glass for fruit as it keeps me from getting sloppy-drunk quicker. The service was alright, but we had to ask for a lot of things including our waiter who seemed to disappear a lot even though the place was almost empty. We had to ask for water, to order more food, etc. At one point we got the manager over when we ordered some stuffed peppers and were perusing the menu for dessert and he was very nice and even sent over a plate of flan since it was what my mom and I talked about possibly getting with him, and apparently we are quite charming whilst intoxicated. This alone kept the 4th star because overall I still wasn't completely impressed as usual. I ordered the tortilla a la espanola, the warm spinach salad, veggies and lentils, stuffed peppers, and the fruit and cheese plate for dessert. My mom ordered some skewers with chorizo, steak, and shrimp which she absolutely fell in love with and she liked the tortilla a la espanola and the stuffed peppers of mine that she tried. The warm spinach salad was a little lacking, they hardly filled the plate. Usually this thing is ridiculously huge to the point where I cannot order any more. The veggies and lentils I was most disappointed in though as it completely lacked any mushrooms at all. This is the one dish I always get because their mushrooms are prepared in it so well and so deliciously that the taste and texture is like biting into a rare steak. But this dish did not have one single mushroom at all. Bummer. Oh and I will now forever only order my flan for dessert as the fruit and cheese plate was alright but nothing to write home about, but I am glad I got it out of the way. One crumbly cheese in particular had me gagging and reaching for all the beverages on the table. Do not want. If I had not been here before I probably would have given it the same rating, maybe a 3.5 since we did spend a ton of money between us and the service was a bit lacking. When you have to look around in an empty restaurant for service and your waiter only shows up once after being served to ask if you're doing okay, that's not that great. Overall I love Firefly but this experience wasn't that great.
5	What can I say in this review that has not been said?? Lets see...JUST GO TRY ONE OF THE BEST DAMN TAPA SPOTS IN VEGAS! AND STOP READING THESE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU MISS OUT! asswipe
2	Okay, this was stop number 2 on our Happy hour hop and I was more than disappointed with this location. My first firefly experience was at the downtown location and it was amazing. This time we walked in and I was not sure if the happy hour was contained to one area so I asked the hostess if we needed to sit at the bar for happy hour and she said nope.. You have about 10 minutes left of happy hour so we will get you seated quickly so we can get you a round or two during happy hour. That right there made me happy, they had already started to show that small glimmer of hope that the downtown location shines radiantly with. After being seated that little light i was just talking about must have burnt out because it was horrid. We sat for about 13 minutes... Yes I counted, and when the server came I asked just to make sure, " Our first round is on happy hour right? We have been sitting here for quite some time" she responded with, " Nope, It's over."  I nicely said to her, " We were sat roughly 15 minutes ago and happy hour ended 5 minutes ago and there is nothing you can do? Again I received, "Nope It's Over, can i get something for you? " So i then said, " Nope, I'm done thank you" . Needless to say we walked out of firefly without eating any of the awesome sliders or the bacon wrapped dates. It's a shame but I could not stand for that on that particular day!!Sorry Firefly on paradise, I will continue to hit the downtown location and hope nothing like this happens there.
5	Excellent tapas restaurant with a spectacular view and reasonable prices!All three dishes we tried-petite filet, artichoke toast, and bacon wrapped dates were delicious!! The red sangria was also very good..... you could taste the fruit infused with the wine. The great view of Fremont street and all of the classic hotels from a modernly decorated restaurant made the atmosphere enjoyable and fun!
4	Pretty good casual place off the strip, a huge locals hangout.  Impossible to spend a ton of money here, tapas menu is extensive and fills you up without draining the wallet. Very good sangriaService is okay but don't expect much from such a casual place. Can get packed and you might have to wait for a table, open till the wee hours of the morning but in vegas what isnt?
5	Life is all about second chances... So is dining. We gave The Fly on Paradise a second chance tonight due to the awesome management and there contact. We walked in and checked in for the 9 o'clock reservation and the hostess was very friendly and let us know that it would be about 5 minutes before our table was ready... " No Problem" 1 star to Firefly.Once we had been sat the waiter was at our table and taking our drink order and asking if  we wanted to get some food started.  We decided to start out with a drink and 4 of the Tapas.  Now, I am not kidding... I had pulled out my phone, unlocked it, logged onto yelp and then the food was at our table. AS fast as we could eat it they were bringing it. We made a few more orders and all the food was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Drinks were all perfectly concocted and the waiter who i wish i could remember his name because I would definitely like to give a shout out to him. He was all over the service... Can you say "TOP NOTCH".Firefly Paradise, you are back on the top of the list. Lets recap this one time. Why is firefly back on the top? Excellent service turnaround, Amazing food, Great atmosphere..This location is great and definitely up to par.
4	This is one of my new favorite spots in LV.We went here with a rather large bachelorette party.  I wasn't involved in the planning aspect of the party, but I was involved in the eating!It took us a little longer than expected to get seated, but with such a large party I could easily overlook it.  The food itself was FABULOUS!  Bacon covered figs?  YUM!  I think I could have had the whole platter if we didn't have more plates coming out.  The beef and mushroom skewers were flavorful and tender.  The 2 shrimp dishes were cooked perfectly.  I preferred the one in the sweet chili sauce.For dessert, I LOVED the chocolate tres leches.  I'm normally not a big fan, but this was a little piece of heaven.  What a treat!I'd love to come back and sample their regular menu.  The prices were so reasonable compared to what you get on the strip, and service is definitely delivered with a smile.
4	Awesome food. Great service. Cool music.
4	Seriously, I don't know how I can add on to the plethora of geat reviews that Firefly has already received; other than being another one of the millions...AND MILLIONS, of fans :)Came here for the first time w/ a few ppl this past memorial day wknd.  We were already going because our friend wanted to hit this place up, so I would end up having to review this place no matter what.The first thing I heard was that this place can get pretty packed...but we showed up @ about 8:40PM and our friends already had a table ready for us.  The wait was supposed to be a min of 30 min, but I guess we got lucky.  WSOP and a UFC fight might have kept the masses at bay during this time, so all the better for us.This is definitely now one of my favorite spots to eat in LV.  Spanish Tapas; love em love em love em!  There is SUCH a variety of things to choose from, from the bacon-wrapped dates(sounds strange, but actually VERY good), to the various types of empanadas, to the ahi skewers, to the duck rolls...seriously too many things to name, and we had a LOT of them.  It's basically like picking various appetizers and finger foods and everyone gets a little taste, and moves on.  So you end up ordering maybe 8-10 items for a party of 4 or 5.  And that left us quite full...  very affordable(items range between $5-9 per item and each of us ended up spending about $25 each, and that was with several pitchers of Sangria.Parking - it's a plaza so there's a good amount of parking.  Just remember that if you take a cab there(about $10-15), it might be hard finding one back, unless there are more and more people coming into the resto.  Service staff - very friendly and very attentive.  They definitely pleasured me - in all manners of restaurantism!
4	Had a lot of delicious food here.  We had the sliders (the petite filet, I think), tuna tartare, ceviche,  albondigas, lamb chops, stuffed peppers, and some other stuff.I really enjoyed the ceviche.  The lambchops were tender and flavorful.  I also liked the texture and flavor of the tuna tartare, although my boyfriend thought it reminded him a little of cat food.  My boyfriend said the petite filet sliders were the best burgers he had ever had.We also ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria.  We were starting to get drunk by this time, so maybe that has affected my review, but I thought everything was delicious, including the sangria.  I particularly liked the lambchops and ceviche.
3	We came here with a large group of girls and had the Tapas Banquet for $30/pp plus some pitchers of Sangria at $24/pitcher.  Included in the Tapas Banquet is a starter of  some house bread, almond butter, smoked almonds, and marinated olives.  For our tapas, we ordered:Chicken Salad Smoked Salmon on Brioche ToastBacon-Wrapped DatesSteak Skewers with Mushrooms and Red Wine SauceCamarones a la Diabla  (Spicy Shrimp)Camarones al ajillo (Garlic Butter Sauce)For the most part the food was good. I thought the Chicken Salad was a little out of place at a tapas restaurant. But it was okay. The Smoked Salmon was meh. Tasted more like salmon salad spread on bread. So with these two as our introduction to Firefly, I was really hoping it was going to improve. Thankfully it did.  The  Bacon-Wrapped Dateswere a good combination of rich, sweet, and salty.  The Steak Skewers were filling.  The Camarones a la Diabla had a spicy little kick to it but I preferred the Camarones al ajillo instead. It just depends on your preference.   The dessert platter had a combination of caramel flan, a tres leches cake and some shortbread and fruit pastries. The suuuuperstar was the Chocolate Tres Leches.  Since it was family style, we kept asking for more. Unfortunately, we were on a time constraint so we couldn't stay and fully enjoy the tres leches at our leisure. But I would definitely come back to Firefly just for that!!! Mmmm!The service was good with the waiters on top of making sure we had everything. Overall, a good experience with a-ok food.
5	A good friend of mine suggested that my friends and I go here for dinner because of the view and the food. I gotta say, they were BOTH 5 stars!I had never had tapas before going to Firefly. Please know that I am VEGAN and was able to eat like... 4-5 plates. I could have eaten a ton more, but there's a lot of dishes that are all veggies or can be made vegan very easily if you just ask. My friends had seafood dishes that they said were great as well. Prices are extremely reasonable -- especially for drinks! $5 for a drink in Vegas is about as refreshing as it gets.The view from where we were sitting was just... wow. Be sure to try to get a table in up in the atrium-type area inside the glass dome! You get the Fremont Street Experience from your seat! If you don't know what that is, Google it. All in all, Firefly is just FULL OF AWESOME. P.S. Try to make reservations!
5	Tapas and Sangria...yes please! I go here whenever I am in Vegas, and have introduced this restaurant to some of my friends as well and everyone loves it. You can eat here and drink and still have money to gamble. The restaurant is in a small shopping center, so parking is difficult. I would also make reservations on a Friday or Saturday night, since it is pretty popular. My favorites are the sangria, tuna tartare, stuffed dates (love blue cheese and bacon), ham and cheese croquetas, and filet mignon sliders. However, go somewhere else for dessert if you are craving sweets....they are not good at Firefly.
4	What a great find on our recent trip to Vegas.  Everyone was in the mood to try new things and share and that is half the fun of this place.  Lots of great tapas and you must try their aged Sangria.  The staff were friendly and patient, the food was wonderful and the bill was easy to cover.  I had to try their paella and they did not disappoint me.  There is plenty of parking at the Paradise Road location and if the weather is not terribly hot, you can sit outside.I plan on returning and trying more of their tapas.
5	A friend of my good friend recommended this place while we were having a girls weekend in Vegas. I've never been to a tappas restaurant and I was so glad this place was my first. It has such a great atmosphere and a perfect place to have dinner & drinks with your girls. We actually went here after watching Sex in the City with my friends and it was perfect!! The sangria is AMAZING, love all their dishes, and we tasted about 8-10...and their dessert, was off the hook! We tried the chocolate tres leches and their chocholate w/ banana dish, yummy! If you're ever in Vegas, I highly recommend trying this place, you won't regret it!
5	This is a great place to unwind before or after going out on the strip. Great place to meet up with friends, cus it is not too loud. It is located parallel to the strip so none of that chaos. The food is delicious, but the portions are tight. I enjoyed the tierra y mar skewers, empanadas,   stuffed dates, fire fries with aoli and their complimentary starter sweet butter and croquetas. I recomment a pitcher of ANY flavor mojitos (more bang for your buck), I prefer mango.
5	I think we ate half the menu. All of it was mind-blowingly good.You think that's hyperbole? it's not. I went with two TOUGH people to find food for on account of their pickyness. Even they were impressed. Every bite was amazing. It's going to be tough to find a tapas bar to compete with this place.We had no less than 8 plates, all of them awesome. The lamb skewers were sublime. The diablo shrimp was so good, we wanted to save the sauce for dipping. Hell, we wanted to dip the flan in it, it was so good!Great atmosphere. Great service. And incredible food. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas!
4	Second time at Firefly (weird thing was we got the same table)....great crowd, awesome food, great drinks...what more could you want?Definitely going back when I get back to Vegas.
5	7 girls + 18 dishes + 2 pitchers of Sangria = a tummy full of HAPPINESS!!Went on a girls reunion trip with the UCLA girls to Vegas and we knew we wanted to have a good dinner meal for Saturday. With no idea what to get, the lovely May suggested Firefly. We heard it could be busy so we called to see if we could make reservations but they told us it wasn't that busy around 6:30 which was the time we wanted to go and that it gets busy later at night (very true). The atmostphere is awesome. It's dim with red accents, and there's latin dance type of music playing. Right when we walked in I had already seen two of the waiters/waitresses dancing a little- it was very cute. So we sat down, and decided to order whatever we felt like because either way it would have been cheaper than if we had decided to go to Joel Robuchon's restaurant in the MGM (which I definitely want to try). Here's what we ordered- 1. 2 plates stuffed dates ----soooo good2. 2 plates manchego mac & cheese- pretty good but not the best of all the dishes3. 2 plates of chorizo & chicken stuffed mushrooms4.  ceviche shrimp- very good5. Thai beef salad6. petite filet7. lambchops8. spicy lamb sausage9. mussels10. shrimp diabla 11. paella12. ham and cheese croquetas13. tuna tartare14. chocolate cherry bread pudding15. dessert platterMy favorites- stuffed dates, the ceviche, the petite filet, stuffed mushrooms, ham and cheese croquetas, lamb sausage & Paella- the paella is very good to get and large enough to share with a lot of people. My least favorites- the tuna tartare (tasted a little funny, we think they added mayo or something to it) and the lambchops (didn't have that lamb flavor). and of course the chocolate bread pudding was very good with ice cream. The dent- only $35 per girl with tip. A lot better than the minimum of at least $100 at Robuchon =)
4	Very delicious meal and great serving size. I mean of course the size is small but I order three different dishes and I was full after two. If anything you mite want to eat slow and order some drinks. I definitely think the bacon wrapped dates were ridiculously good. But I won't just recommend any certain dish just because everything is good
4	If I only tried the Paella this place would have gotten a 5 star easily.The Paella was by far my favorite dish and I absolutely loved it. I ended up saving half for the next day, but I accidentally left it on top of a slot machine. I was really sad when that happened. Let's get right to the summary.Seating: Fast (Got busy really fast, recommend getting there before 9pm on Saturdays).Service: GreatFood: Here is what I triedPitcher of Sangria: 3/5 Stars - I've had better, not bad.Shrimp Diabla: 3/5 Stars - Missing a lot flavors, not that spicy.Stuffed Dates: 3.5/ 5 Stars - It tasted like Sausage and Bacon w/ Maple Syrup. It was my girlfriend's favorite of the night.Duck Roll: 3.5/ 5 Stars - I wish the sauce was a little too sour for my taste, but this dish has a lot of potential.Paella - 5/5 Stars I love this dish. Its only $15 and you get a lot of food. I almost opt for the 14oz Rib Eye w/ Fries for $20...Thank God I didn't.Prices here are very reasonable. It won't break your bank compared to eating at other restaurants (especially on the Strip).Can't wait to come back in 3 weeks to eat here again.
4	Firefly has possibly the best sangria I've had in my entire life! I came here during my most recent Vegas trip (annual sorority pledge class trip), and it didn't disappoint. Normally, I only love red wine sangria, but the white and sparkling here were both excellent, as well. The tapas are decent, but I'd come here again for the drinks!
2	food was definitely cheap.. but you get what you pay for. Did not enjoy the food. It was nothing special. Drinks were good.. Service was TERRIBLE!
5	Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  And definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.I'll be back again!!
5	loved this place.  pretty much everything is good, especially the fries, the mac and cheese, and the bacon wrapped dates.  we had a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of sangria, i loved the mojitos (and they were strong) but i wasn't a fan of the sangria (although i don't like sangria in general so its nothing against them ...).  great for a girls night or a date night.  we went for a bachelorette party and i thought the service was more than adequate (and they brought our bride a free shot, which was a nice touch).  Prices were pretty reasonable given the quality of the food.  Wish i lived in vegas so i could go back!
4	I'm a big fan of tapas so I usually go to Firefly when I'm going to a concert at the Hard Rock. I've gone to the location downtown a few times now and actually think I like it there better. The service is slightly spottier downtown, but it's a cool room and it's great place to bring out-of-towners to get the whole old school Vegas experience.  Anyway, a couple months ago we went to the original location and I was really disappointed...the bread was drenched in oil and everything was super greasy. We gave it another shot last night and they were back on point. I guess someone was just heavy handed with the oil that one night.  My faves are the artichoke toasts, eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac & cheese and shrimp a la diabla. Firefly doesn't really do "traditional" Spanish tapas, but they do have a few interpretations of classics. I just like it because I can basically order 10 different things off the menu without seeming like a giant hog or breaking the bank.
5	A friend of mine recommended this place and I was really happy we went. It was nice to be off the craziness of the Strip in a more relaxed atmosphere. My friends and I went at 5pm on a Monday so it wasn't crowded. We were seated right away. We ordered the sangria (red, they also have white and sparkling) which was excellent. We ordered 4 different tapas - eggplant cannelloni, tortilla, stuffed mushrooms and fried potatoes. The eggplant cannelloni was my favorite, with crispy slices wrapped around goat cheese. The tortilla was not exactly like I'd had it in Spain - it came layered on toothpicks - but it was decent as were the potatoes. I didn't try the mushrooms because they had chorizo, but my friends said they were good. The service was very attentive, refilling our water every five minutes and answering questions about the menu items. Our entire bill came to $26. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.
4	I love this place ever since my cousin introduced it to me last year in Vegas.  The tapas bar has many different plates to share.  My favorited being the stuffed dates, paella, filet mignon sliders, olives, fries, and much more.  They have the best sangria hands down.  I would come to firefly, just for that!  A nice cold pitcher sangria in the desert heat!
4	The food itself was really good, definitely get the bacon wrapped dates and flan.  If you're really hungry/have a lot of people to split with, get the paella (it's $18 but there's a LOT of it).  I also had the manchego mac and cheese which was pretty amazing.  I also got a mango mojito, but I couldn't taste any mango.My gripes about this place have to do with the service.  I saw my server three times total, but there was a really nice guy who kept coming around and taking care of me.  But when I asked him if our server split his tips, the guy was like "sometimes" so I ended up tipping him along with my server (who I didn't want to tip at all because he didn't do anything, but he just never came back with my change).  Also our server forgot to put in one of my orders (steamed mussels) but he made up for that with free "birthday flan" which is funny since it really was my birthday.
4	If you're willing to go just a short distance off-Strip to dine, this seems to be the place to go. We were there late on a weeknight, and it was packed! After dining there, I can see why. They have a great selection of traditional Spanish and other unique tapas, all reasonably priced. And the portions are more like appetizers meant to be shared than the two-bite tapas you find in Spain. Ordering about three tapas per person should be more than enough. The bacon wrapped dates, stuffed peppers, croquettas, tuna skewers, and eggplant are all excellent. The service is prompt and friendly and the atmosphere, while it can't compare to the hotel/casino places, is festive nonetheless.
4	Wow....  when you want true authentic Tapa's go here!!!  Was craving the great tapa's you can get in Spain and found this place by accident.  This was the best accident we have ever had!!  The manchego mac n cheese is to die for.  The Stuffed Dates wrapped in bacon, the tomato biscue and and and and..................   Everything was fantastic!  I only rate a 4 because the dining room was just OK.  Appropriate decor but be a little better.  Staff was also great!  We also eat here on our way out of Vegas.  Save the best for last.
5	My only complaint about this restaurant is that it's not located right next to my house!   We normally visit Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba on the Strip when we go to Vegas because the food was great and we had our wedding reception there.  Unfortunately, no one else appreciated it as much as us because they closed Ba-ba-reeba down and put some boring Mexican food place there.  My husband suggested we go to Firefly instead, and WOW - this is the best tapas EVER!  We tried 8 items total, including a salad, and every single thing was incredible.  I only wish I hadn't been so full because I would have ordered even more.  Our waiter was very friendly, and there are multiple people running food and helping out so we were never wanting.  The atmosphere was cool and lively without being too much.  Prices are great too - our entire bill with food, a pitcher of sangria (yum!), and tip was right around 100 bucks.  We will definitely go here again - and you should too!
5	So... there was no seating available indoors, so my girlfriend and I agreed to sit outdoors. I don't know about you, but it's very hard for me to enjoy a meal (or anything) in 120 degree weather... until Firefly. You are amazing.
4	I do love Firefly and although this past event was for a big group I was slightly disappointed thus the four star rating.  Although I received lots of attention and great service, it turns out the far end of my table was and felt a little neglected.  While I was getting ample bread, plenty of refills and attentive answers to my requests for more dishes the rest of the table was struggling for attention.  As for the food I do have a favorite new dish in Pulpo Asado which was a grilled version of octopus that came with lentils and an excellent choice for my diet.  The splurge I had was the Epanadas that were slightly dry but still flavorful and well accompanied by the aioli sauce on top.  Overall my glass was full and my stomach was satisfied but for a big group things could've been managed far better.  I won't stop coming here but I certainly will limit the size of my party in the future.
5	Awesome Awesome Awesome!!! Firefly's is delicous!!! Great food, great enviroment, great drinks, friendly and great service! What more can a girl ask for? The food here can only be described as orgasmic!!! Im a vegetarian, so it's great to go to a place that has delicous food for EVERYONE! Trust me... the food IS ORGASMIC!
4	I've had Firefly food at events, but have not yet graced them with a visit. Our Yelparazzi Angela H.'s farewell party was reason enough to head down for Yelpacious Dishes. I came late so I didn't order too much, but grabbed: Boquerones which has Spanish white anchovies (not the salted kind), red peppers, avocado and light chili oil drizzle on toast...said it has yellow pepper vin in the menu, but didn't see it on there? Overall, this is nice and really is a no fail dish. I love any kind of briny, lemony fish on crusty bread. Pulpo Asado which has grilled octopus, potato, tomato stirred in what taste like mojo (garlic, oil and citrus). Pretty good, but there is a consistency that is a bit soft/mushy on parts of the octopus that either tells me this was frozen too long or was precooked/overcooked (octo gets tough and chewy, then gets soft if you keep going). The flavors were good, but there was just the freshness aspect that I question since some pieces didn't have that octopi snappy chewiness. Banana Nutella Sandwiches- simple, good....who doesn't like nutella, bananas and crispy grilled up bread? I can make this at home ( I shouldn't- Nutella and I have a dangerous romance) , but this is a ingenious comfort dessert that appeals to a lot of people. I got an ice tea and I know we were a big party, but service please? .....maybe refill us? I got one refill of tea in a wine size glass and I did have to ask for it. Someone said that one end of the table got bread, but the other table didn't. Also that some people got some refills, but most didn't. They got 20% gratuity automatically because we were a big crowd. Sure it's a given tip, but if you work a little you might get some extra tip. Looked like the server was expecting more when we asked for change back and there was nothing inside the tab. I'm a very fair tipper (I go up or down from my standard 20%, last place I ate at- they received 30% tip ) and no, I did not think 20% gratuity was even fair if I can't get some tea in 100*+ heat.  I just didn't think Firefly was very accommodating. Firstly, they told us that a majority of the party needs to be there on time or they are giving out table away in 15 minutes. We planned this weeks ago, it's a Yelp event, so people will show. It's my fucking main bitches party, I'll come even if I got a leg amputated hat day dammit.  They wont split checks for a group of maybe 18 Yelpers, not even maybe split into smaller sections so it's easier to pay. We had to work it out with cash and do the math to get the bill right. So keep that in mind if you're coming in a big party- don't invite the bill moocher friend...I know everyone has one. This would make a good date night restaurant with the BF or a spot to bring visitors during "off" hours.  Tapas is one of my favorite things so the draw of sangria and plates will eventually bring me back, but I wont be back with a big party- ever.
4	I went to Firefly for the UYE, but my schedule didn't allow me to stay for the group so I went a little early.I got there at 5pm, and had no problem snagging a stool at the bar. They run a Happy Hour from 4-6 with half priced drinks, and I must say the Mojitos were really good.This summer I decided I'm gonna try Mojitos whenever possible and have been drinking my way across town, I have to say Firefly's are top notch.I had the Pomegranate and the Watermelon Mojitos, both were hand muddled, the Pomegranate included Pomegranate Juice, while the watermelon one included some watermelon syrup that made it taste just like a Jolly rancher.They also had Sangria that looked amazing, but I wasn't really in a wine type of mood.As for eats I had the Meatballs, i think there were 6 meatballs that were served in a tomato sauce and topped with Parmesan cheese, the meatballs weren't anything super fancy but good, but the sauce and cheese were great.I also had their Tomato Basil Soup- The soup was amazing, you could really taste both the tomato and the basil. It came with a Bire grilled cheese that was surprisingly good, I'm usually not a Brie fan, but this was a very delicious companion to the soup.The bread and olives that they serve is a nice touch, the compound garlic butter was amazing, and it was a great starter to the meal.I will be going back and trying my way across the drink and tapas menu, undoubtedly during happy hour!!!
4	Came here the other night for Angela H's UYE goobye party.I wasn't all that hungry so I ordered the Tuna Tartare and the Ceviche. Both were yummy!! I shared em with Lisa L. and tried some of the dishes she ordered. I don't remember which ones they were, but they were good too.I had some sangria and some mojitos to drink. Both were great!The staff was all friendly and came by often to check if we needed more drinks or food.I had an awesome time here with the Yelp-izzles and also met D from LA.
4	I live two blocks from this place and had yet to go.  But if your going to Firefly it up, the first time is always better with the Yelperazzi Posse for Angela H's Adios Fiesta. I love me some tapas or I like to refer to as the spanish version of dim-sum.  I've had great sangrias back in NYC and SF, so my expectations were high.  The sangrias are very good and nicely chilled and had plenty of fruit, absolutely order a pitcher or three.  I could've downed a whole pitcher by myself!The Tuna tartare which was really good with sliced mangoes on top.  I also tried the Chorizo Clams which was kind of bland...probably wouldn't order that one again.  Veggie empanadas were good, but I don't think I've ever had a bad empanada that I wouldn't destroy.  Unfortunately I missed out on the 3-6 happy hour but great to know for next time and look forward to checking out the downtown location also.
4	A couple of dishes disappointed me this past weekend, but I still had a wonderful time at Firefly.Tip: They do not accept reservations for parties of less than 10 on Fridays and Saturdays, and this place can get really pack. I highly recommend going before 7:30 P.M, or you're going to wait 30 minutes for 2 people, and more depending on the size of your party.I ordered the Paella (my favorite dish) and it did not disappoint me again. For $18, you get a well made dish and a lot of food here. You can easily share this dish with 4 people. Since it was my favorite dish, I ate 75% of it.   5 / 5 StarsDo not order the fries here. The portion of the fries were generous (a basket actually), but it was not prepared well at all. McDonald's fries are out of this world when you compare them to Firefly. 1.5 / 5 stars -Empanadas:  first time eating Empanadas and I actually liked it.  The ground meat inside had a nice textured and it was stuffed inside a pie-like crust. 3.5 / 5 stars-Mac & Cheese: Macaroni Shells were used in this dish, a little different, but I was fine with it. I would probably avoid ordering this simply because it wasn't as cheesy as I would like, and it definitely did not have a thick crispy layer of cheese crust. 2 / 5 stars-Stuffed Dates: I actually enjoyed my dates a little more this trip. I definitely enjoyed biting into the almond and tasting bacon at the same time. 4 / 5 stars.Watermelon Mojita like mostly reviews mentioned, tasted a lot like a Jollyrancher. I'm not a fan of this drink. I would avoid ordering, and stick with the Sangria. 2 / 5 starsFor dessert, I had the Bread Pudding and it came out cold. I spoke to the server and they corrected it. It was my 2nd time trying this dessert, a lot better the first time. 3.5 / 5 stars
4	Normally I do not review places with so many reviews already that I agree with.  But my Mom and I went, enjoyed our dishes, and my Mom talked about the Sangria for 4 days.  I don't drink, so I have to take her word for it.
4	This is a great place for authentic spanish tapas!I am a big fan of their Ham and cheese croquetas (which is cerrano ham with Manchego cheese), seafood paella, ceviche with shrimp, and Lamb skewers. Also, as I have said in my yelps before... I put a big emphasis  on how a restaurant closes the experience with their desserts. I am absolutely in love with their chocolate tres leches cake. It is so soft and moist. It tastes almost as if the cake had been soaked in the milk for an hour. Also, their sangrias are very refreshing, and not too strong if you need to drive home. I like the upbeat atmosphere, but their latin night can get a little too loud.  Skip on the Latin night if you plan on having a date night here. Gets a bit smokey as well, since they allow smoking inside. Seating can be tight, since it is a fairly small venue. And parking can be a bit crazy on the weekends, especially since they share the parking lots with Marrakesh, Ruth Chris, and Satay Grill.
5	This is definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Las Vegas. Firefly is a great restaurant for when your in the mood for something different from the norm. There's is a wait once in a while but nothing outrageous from my experience. The outdoor dining is my favorite any time of year, they have warmers in the winter time to make it just the right temperature. For the record I actually enjoy it a little cold so take that into consideration. When you sit outside you kinda feel like you aren't even in Vegas. With a delicious Mojito in your hands and the green grass and trees along the side of the dining area blocking off the road, it's a good little escape. The inside dining area is nice as well but I just prefer the outdoors. One side of the indoor dining looks like a comfy lounge with couches and tables and the other side is like a slightly crowded restaurant with a bar on one side.        Now to the more important part. The food! It's awesome! I have to order the herb roasted chicken every time. It's a half a chicken bursting with flavor. It's delicious and tender, falling off the bone. It also comes with their absolutely incredible firefly fries. They are great. They have a nice flavor and a little bit of shredded, melty cheese here and there. I recommend it highly. I also suggest the short ribs which are also incredibly tender and delicious. The machengo mac n cheese is worth checking out. I get it every once in a while. It's hot and cheesy. A little too rich to eat for one person. But to share it's good, and sharings kinda the point at a tapas joint. My Ex-girlfriend who, I exposed this place to, loved the chicken salad as well. That's the dish she has to order each time.      The prices aren't outrageous especially for the food quality and ambiance.     Overall, Firefly is a great date place, friend hang out, and business lunch spot all at the same time. And though the tapas can easily add up, especially with a number of mojitos thrown in, it's not too outrageous or out of line. You definitely need to check it out at least once. Plus it's close enough to the strip if you're just here on vacation. Don't let the summerlin location put you off to this one. This one is far better!
4	*3.5 *I yelped this place upon a quick decision to stay in Las Vegas. We always stay at a Marriot, and who knew it'd be walking distance? Score. We walked in easily at 6:45pm--seated with water too. Out of a party of 7, each ordered two tapas, then a paella. Favorites: warm spinach salad, lentil and veggies, veg tempura, firefly fries and mac and cheese. The dessert tapas are good too, we had the pistachio, choc and vanilla gelato, nutella/banana sandwiches, and the lemon berry tartlets. Not a really a family friendly restaurant, favors the lounging/bar types, however come early and savor the happy hours specials, prob one of the best deals in this two star town.
4	Excellent flavors. Stuffed Dates and Terra y Mare Skewers were my favorites. Packed with flavor. The sauce on the Terra y Mare Skewers was delicious. The Smoked Salmon Toasts were pretty average but tasty with the capers. And the Empanadas were only average. The ground meat inside wasn't that impressive, and the aioli on top was a negative for me but I'm not a fan of mayonnaise-based sauces.Berry and lychee infused vodka. Sounds good. Love lychee. But didn't love this housemade vodka.They have a small patio seating area, which would be fun to sit at when it's cooler (not in the middle of summer), so keep that in mind when planning a visit to this tapas restaurant. There's also a main dining area and bar with a detached dining area next door. Dark ambience and not really a good place for little kids with the squished seating.Lemon berry tartlets for dessert were excellent but a tapas sized portion. Enough to clean the palate and satisfy a sweet craving but not nearly enough if you like to have your large-portion dessert at the end of a meal. Overall, it was great as a food experience. If you're sick of eating at the big expensive steak restaurants on the strip, try this place.
5	This is truly a 5-star experience for those of you who are (like me) out-of-towners with very Vegas-specific criteria, such as:(1) Organizing a large group dinner - I did two separate bachelorette party dinners here (groups of 8 and 14), both on Saturday nights. (Note: They do not take reservations at this location for less than 10 but our group of 8 got seated pretty quickly in the bar area when we got there around 7:30pm.)(2) On a tight budget but still want really good food - Both times, we stuffed ourselves and still managed to spend less than $25/person on food (about $30/person if you include drinks), inclusive of tax/tip. I am a foodie and so were a lot of the other girls, and everyone absolutely loved this place because the food is such a great value.(3) Fun vibe - It's pretty casual here and it was divier than I expected, but I liked it. It's popular with locals, but not the type that make you feel lame for being all dressed up for a bachelorette party. (All the workers at the Trump, where we were staying, and our cab drivers, kept telling us "great pick!" when we told them where we were going.)(3) Excellent, extremely accommodating service -  For my dinner for 14, they asked me sign a contract to guarantee at least $35/person (not including tax/tip), but did not require a credit card. We ordered as much food and drinks as we could but couldn't hit the $35/person mark before tax/tip, but they were okay with that because they could tell we weren't trying to to be cheap. Also, our server was awesome and helped me keep track of my costs so I wouldn't go over budget. He'd literally say "You just ordered a mojito pitcher. You are now at $253.53". He also gave great recommendations for how many of each item to order.(4) Delicious drinks - The sangria is some of the best I've ever had, and the mojito pitchers are excellent as well.(5) Don't mind a short cab ride off the strip - It's worth it if you're budget-conscious, trust me. It was only $15/cab, about 10 minutes from the Wynn side of the strip. It is a little hard to get a cab back, but the restaurant will call you one; or, just walk over to the steakhouse next door and grab one that's dropping someone off. (6) Relatively quick meal so you can hit the club early and not have to wait in a long-ass line -- The food comes fast, just perfect for an 8 or 8:30pm reservation so by the time you're done and head back to the strip, you have time to do last-minute touch-ups in the hotel bathroom before you hit the clubs.P.S. I also looked at the downtown location, but a few friends that have gone said the ambiance is not as good.P.P.S. What to order - everything was delicious and easily shared; I esp. loved the bacon wrapped dates, meat skewers, paella, croquettes . . . like I said, everything! And don't forget to take a doggy-bag for leftovers -- they keep well, esp. at 5am after a night out clubbing ;)
4	Authentic, delicious, and above all affordable tapas off-strip in Las Vegas. We got a table for 10 same day, without any complications, and tried just about every dish. Without fail, they were incredible, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. I'd like to plug their sangria--red is the best, but if you're looking for something a bit sweeter, the white works as well. The only reason this isn't a five-star review is the overpowering peach flavor of their sparkling sangria.
4	my boyfriend's cousin brought us here when we visited in may/june right before we hit the clubs. the food is amazing. i love mushrooms and the mushroom tart was GREAT! i can't wait to eat here again.although it does get a bit crowded. there were tables outside too and we were right next to the door and everytime the waiter went out the door, a gush of hot wind blew in. all in all the food was bomb.
5	GOOD SANGRIAS! GOOD TAPAS!my friends from Vegas took me to a locals spot away from the strip. It was interesting because i never went anywhere outside of the strip before it was like a totally different city..less chaotic it was like a normal city. We went on a Wednesday and we had to wait an hour to a hour and a half for a table!  I wanted to go somewhere else but they said it was worth the wait. While we waited we ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria. One pitcher for the four of us and we each got about two cups each. It was a pretty good deal!  i thought the red sangria was just "okay" maybe because i am a noob when it comes to drinking wine and i believe the wine they used for the sangria was a dry red wine. when we finally got a table i ordered a glass of white sangria, it was sweeter and less dry, it was very delicious! and  it has little apple pieces in  floating on top.  There was also apples in the red sangria but i didn't really pay attention to it because it kind of blended in.i was impressed at the fact the make the sangrias everyday at the restaurant. we ordered the ceviche and some kind of carne on a stick? it was well seasoned and it complemented the sangria we were drinking. everything was very delicious next time i go to Vegas i am mos def coming back here!
5	This place is amazing!The chef is outstanding! The staff is super helpful and all the food and drinks are amazing.
4	This tapas bar located a little off the strip is another reason why I miss living in Vegas ,this place gets pretty packed and is a good mix of locals and toursist. I have hit up this spot many a night with groups of people to enjoy the ambiance and of course the food. Their sangria is absolutely amazing and is THE way to start of the Firefly experience, some of my favs on the menu are the pork empanadas, the petite filet, the filet mignon sliders AND....the BACON WRAPPED DATES...augghhhh it pains me how good these morsels are because they are so simple. Just give me these and a pitcher of sangria and I'm good to go!
4	Tight crowded setting, but a lot of tasty dishes make this a great place to stop in. I could see having a poor meal here if you got unlucky in ordering, the shrimp ceviche, Thai beef salad, and crispy duck rolls were decidedly below average when I tried them. They do have a lot of really tasty stuff on the menu though, the stuffed dates, albondigas, and babyback ribs are standouts that I really enjoyed.
5	Firefly is about as good as it gets! A well-kept secret that just might soon become Vegas' most popular restaurant. We are locals and had heard how good this place was, and guess what? it was ALL true. There is nothing to not love about Firefly. Mojitas and Sangrias are excellent. Bacon-wrapped dates are sublime. The service was flawless - our waiters Ladell and Alex G. were on it the entire time - nonstop. Overall, a terrific experience! Highly recommended.
5	Go during happy hour. The drinks are half price and the restaurant is less crowded.The mango mojito was the best that I've ever tasted.We ordered a lot of food and couldn't finish everything, so I'll just review the favorites. The mac 'n cheese was extra cheesy and creamy. The vegetables and lentils had a fresh citrus flavor. My boyfriend liked the duck dumplings, but thought that they had too much sauce (I'm sure that you could ask the chef to go light on the sauce). The ham and cheese croquets were my boyfriend's favorite. They looked like gourmet tater tots and were very creamy.Even though we were stuffed I ordered the caramel flan for dessert. It wasn't that gelatinous stuff that you get a Chevy's. It was delightfully creamy and smooth.Go to Firefly even though it's not on the strip. Share a taxi with some friends and it will be well worth it.
5	Best tapas in Vegas. I've been to that one on the Strip and one in Town Square and those were over priced and so-so on taste, but Firefly has remained continually good! I've been going to Firefly for years and never get tired of their variety of dishes. Their sangria and mojitos are also some of the best I've ever had. They also have the best variety on their menu.
4	I like this place and it seems very popular. The crowd is young and attractive. The culinary fair is of course "tapas" or what i consider tasty appetizer dishes where one orders in a way similar to a sushi bar.I mostly enjoyed what I had, although, some in my party complained about the tapas being overly rich with shortening. I must concede some were. Over all I like the place and the young crowd.I like the stuffed dates.Parking can be intimidating.
5	Still in my top 5 favorite restaurants.  I brought 4 new people here and they raved about the variety and creativeness of the tapas.  Pitchers of mojito's rolled and we finished with some tres leches and flan.  what a killer place.  I hear they opened another location in DT LV.  I'll have to try that next time.  My go to place when in sin city.
5	Went to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party with 15 girls and didn't know where to go to dinner before we went out clubbing. Asked a friend who is a native to Las Vegas and she recommended FireFly Tapas Restaurant. I am sooooooo happy that she recommended this place!!! We were able to book through their party planners, Regina and Valeria, and they really set us up to have an amazing evening. We did the $55 per person set menu and this included 2 hours of unlimited drinks and 6 choices of tapas items. We picked 6 different tapas items and they brought them out unlimited. Every single item that we ordered was OUTSTANDING!!! I honestly can't pick which item was better than the other. We had the Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates, Camarones a la Diabla, Eggplant Canneloni, Ahi Tuna Skewers, Terra y Mar Skewers and the Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms. They were all AMAZING!!!All of the drinks were great, but I do have to say the Sparkling Sangria was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! It was delicious!!!Then, for dessert, they brought out cupcakes that were appropriate for "bachelorette" parties only...This was a cute little twist on dessert and just another way they were able to make our night so special!I have to say, Regina and Valeria were extremely flexible with our reservation and the entire experience was amazing! They were willing to move the time around to accommodate us and make sure everything was perfect. We had Ivan as our server and he was outstanding as well! The service was impeccable. Ivan and a few other food runners were constantly at our table making sure every girl had a full drink in their hand at all times. He was there at a moment's notice with anything anybody requested!I have to say that this was just an amazing experience and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas. I hope that they open them up all over because I can't wait to go back!!!!
5	This place is wonderful!! GREAT food, wonderful prices. A MUST go every VEgas trip.
5	This place is daddy! This is the best Tapas place in Vegas, hands down. What's nice about this place is it's not all touristy etc. This is more of a locals hangout spot. Lot's of sexiness there, so you may wanna throw on some Cologne for this one. My Favs: Dates wrapped in Bacon Thai Beef Salad Baked Tetilla Meatballs Chicken Skewers Duck Rolls Merguez Cherry Bread Pudding Its right across the street from the Hard Rock.
4	Very convenient to the downtown/fremont st. hotels, with a view of the fremont st. light show (the restaurant is on the second floor of the building).  Waiters were very attentive to our large group and the food was very tasty.   However, if you're used to tapas in other places, where the operative word is 'small', watch out - Vegas does everything big and that includes tapas.  I ended up with about twice as much food as I expected.
3	Over-rated and undervalued
5	This place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Whenever visitors come, i tell them they should stop by this place. In fact, we went this past Saturday and had the stuffed dates, the Machengo mac and cheese, the ceviche, 2 orders of the sliders, the chicken skewers, and the mussels. There was a pitcher of Sangria as well as several other desserts. Oh and somehow we fit in banana-nutella sandwiches, chocolate bread pudding and lemon berry tarts. Everyone loved everything. This is no joke. I do not lie about food lol. For 6 adults, this was sooo filling and our bill was about $120.
5	Yep - pretty awesome food and priced like it's in a strip mall.   Oh yeah, it's IN a strip mall.Seriously, the almond butter that comes with the bread is probably my favorite thing.  The bacon wrapped dates seem to be the most popular, but I think that is just because they are not typical.  I also tried the sliders, mac and cheese, empanadas, ribs, and meatballs.  All of them were above average, but not necessarily spectacular.  They have 3 kinds of sangria which is a nice change, although I wonder how much non red sangria they sell.This place is pretty casual and works best in multiples of 2.  All the dishes come in 2 or 4 pieces which is something to be aware of...so if you have 3 people, you gotta order double of everything.  Finally....   Yes it is worth the trip off of the main drag.
4	Thank you, Yelpers, for helping us find this restaurant.  What a great place! Eight of us went for a birthday celebration on August 19.   So how do you do tapas for 8 people?  Order one of nearly everything, cut it up to share bites and then just order more of whatever was favored.  The table was seriously overflowing with food.  The big favorites for our table were the Manchego Mac n Cheese, the Lamb chops (my 12 year old wanted her own order),  Stuffed Dates,  Terra y Mare skewers and Ham and Cheese Croquetas.   We also had the Firefly fish sticks, Fried Calamari, Camarones a la diabla, Camarones al ajillo, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls, Baked Tetilla and Albondigas.  I know we had more but I can't remember.  I just recall enjoying every bite and being so full that we couldn't try dessert.   Oh, wait, they did bring a flan for the birthday guest.  Tasty!!This will be a regular stop on our Vegas trips whether for sangria, mojitos and few bites, or to pig out like we did.   For me personally, I'll order the Manchego Mac n Cheese, the lamb chops and the Terra y Mare skewers again and then I'll try some of the other items and work my way through the menu.  Next time I'm definitely trying the Roasted Eggplant Canneloni - just no room for it this time.  Tapas was a new concept for my mom.  She couldn't quite understand small plates of food to share.  I told her it was like Spanish dim sum and she instantly understood.   For those of you new to the concept of tapas - start with just two or three menu items to share and hold on to a menu.  Try it.  Like it?  Order another or try something else.  You could seriously just keep ordering another item, and then another, and then another.   My 9 and 12 year olds even enjoyed it.   Good food - nothing pretentious or fancy, just good comfort-style food..
3	We actually ventured off the strip and made our way to Firefly that was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Vegas. The first and most annoying part of this restaurant is the staff who answers the phone and act as the first faces who greet you as you come in. Pretty much everyone had a bit of an attitude with us. They would also reiterate that there are NO RESERVATIONS taken here. Once we arrived, we asked about possibly waiting for one of the table up front that had some nice loungey (is that a real word?) couches and were told that you had to call ahead for that!  Hellooooo thats usually a reservation right? So weird. The food itself was pretty tasty but your usual tapas, nothing too unique. The sangria was great. I would recommend this restaurant for a quick bite and a drink but wouldnt really go out of my way to go again.
4	LUNCH REVIEWFirst off - No air conditioning in the afternoon in July in Vegas? You got to be kidding me.  At one point we thought we felt some air coming on, but it was so light we weren't sure if we were simply imagining it.  Sorry, but I got to dock you a star just for that.Second - They had like one waiter for the entire room. There were a couple of bus boys and a bartender, but they were useless when it came to things like getting our check. We pretty much had to rely on flagging down the hostess because the ONE waiter kept disappearing in the back.  Took forever to get out of there once we ate.HOWEVER, I can't dock them any points because they made up for it by being honest on the check - I did my math wrong and wrote an extra $10 for the total.  If they had taken that extra $10, that would be another story.Now, FINALLY, on to the FOOD.Starter plate of BREAD. (Don't know why they give you this as half their dishes come with the exact same bread anyway.) This starter plate of bread was stale. Eww. The bread that came with other dishes was less stale, but still not very delicious. However, the SWEET BUTTER was delicious.  Better than the apple butter at Lucille's.The Good:GARDEN VARIETY SALAD - I liked this salad.  It had a good blend of sweet and sour, but I loved the addition of the feta cheese. Mmm. Somehow the feta just made it work.FRIED CALAMARI - Fried pretty well, and I loved their sauce. It was something creamy and no doubt filled with fat, but who cares when you're in Vegas?CAMARONES AL DIABLO/AL AJILLO - Diablo is chile and ajillo is garlic butter. Camarones is shrimp. I thought the chile sauce was outstanding. That sauce was so good, we were dipping everything in it, and thankfully they give you plenty of sauce to work with!  The garlic butter I thought was okay - nothing special but not bad either. If you love garlic like I do, it might be a bit light for you.FRIES - Good, but nothing compares to the Boiling Crab's cajun fries. NOTHING. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-garden-grove-2)Definitely try the dipping sauce that comes with it (looked like the sauce that came with the calamari, but I can't be sure if they're the same or not.)The meh:The DUCK ROLL was only okay. I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce - I thought it was a little too sour. THAI BEEF SALAD - dressing was a little too salty for my tastes, but the beef was pretty tender and even better when we dipped it in the AL DIABLO sauce.BAKED ATILLA - Cheese fondue with sausage? How can you go wrong?  Well, by using a really bitter cheese. If you like that sort of thing, go for it - otherwise, stay away.PAELLA - I love the idea of paella, but I seem to have a hard time finding paella that I actually like.  The flavor always seems to be a bit off.  Don't know if it's just me being incompatible with the authentic flavors or what, but yeah.  I honestly didn't like the flavors here too much, but the rice was the perfect texture (I hate when it's too soggy) and the seafood was fresh.Dessert:PASSIONFRUIT CHEESECAKE - it's less sweet than the others, so if you get other desserts, eat this first. TRES LECHES CHOCOLATE - MMMM. Not too sweet or too rich, and it's got lots of cocoa flavor.FLAN - Good, but not quite rich enough. Caramel was pretty awesome though.LEMON-BERRY TART - rock hard but good with the condensed milk.Note: They play their music kind of loud - It was just on this side of unbearable for me (but note that I have a low tolerance for decibel levels).  Late night when the place is packed would probably be worse with people trying to talk over it.  I did like the music though - they mostly played world music with a Spanish feel.
4	Firefly is my favorite place in Vegas for dinner... If you love tapas, or have never tried it, this is the place to go. You can make reservations online or call the restaurant ahead of time to reserve seating. I love their Shrimp Ceviche and Empanadas! Draw backs to this place- it's a small venue, so expect to be packed into a small table and the service is hit or miss. Otherwise, the food is awesome and worth the trip off the strip!
5	Great food in small and very affordable. Atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining.  If you like Sangia,this place the best. I recommend to try everything in the menu. You won 't be disappointed.
4	Went here the other night on a date and even though the date was only mediocre the food and drinks were good!  I started off with the sparkling sangria which was tasty.  We ordered the stuffed dates (can't wait to have again...YUM!), terra y mare skewers (my date really liked those...me not as much), empanadas (delish!), sliders (I didn't try, but he didn't really care for them....yet still ate 2/3 of them), and the shrimp tempura (Yuck!  It definitely didn't seem like tempura...the batter was too thick and the shrimp is usually halved isn't it?!).  The service was good...she kept checking back with us.  I should have had 3 or 4 drinks instead the 2 I had.  Maybe I would've liked my date more?!  HAHAOh, and on a prior visit I had the tomato soup with the brie grilled cheese sandwich...very tasty!
4	Good variety of tapas, service can be slow to nonexisting when its crowded, which is often the case at lunch time. Get there early!
5	Firefly is one of those off-the-strip places that Vegas locals love.  It's a tapas bar (not to be confused with topless bar) serving up Spanish small plates packed with big flavors.  The sangria is plentiful, the music is loud and the place is always busy, especially late at night. So don't be surprised if there's a wait at 1am on a week night.  It's a cool place to grab a bite, a drink, or have a full-on meal.  Since the dishes are small and reasonably priced, it's great for sharing and trying a variety of things. Me and the hubs have always had a huge soft spot for Firefly.Our Favorites:Red Sangria- fruity but strong. My absolute favorite sangria in the world... (and I've studied abroad in Spain!)Filet mignon sliders $7.50-  Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onionsManchego Mac and cheese $8Ham and cheese croquetas $5 - fried pillowy bites of potato filled with hot melted cheese and ham... this is a must!Albondigas $4.50- meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, parmesanBaked tetilla $7- roasted tomato and tetilla cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts... oooooh baby goodCrispy duck rolls with cherry hoisin sauce $8Firefly Fries $5.50- some of the best fries I've had.  Thinly cut, seasoned and topped with parmesan and herbs.  The aioli is worth licking the cup clean.Firefly has opened another location in downtown LV because they are THAT awesome.  Maybe they'll be spreading the love this direction sometime soon? Fingers crossed.
5	Found out about this place on Yelp - the wifey and I gave it a spin!!! Wow the food was amazing the Sliders!! The camarones a la diabla, were the bomb!! The house specialty was great - ask the staff to make the recommendation!! Outstanding service!
1	not sure why this place has so many decent reviews.the 1 star just goes to the sangria and that is it.food was not memorable, food was not appetizing to eat or to look at.service was horrible...do not come here........ i came here because i was told its a good local spot..... but stick to the strip with all the amazing chefs at the hotels....
3	I felt we were paying largely for the atmosphere. The patio was packed when we arrived and the inteior has nice decorations with red being the primary theme. The candles are a nice touch and make the open seating feel a little more intimate. The front waiting area is like a lounge. The bar was well attended and looked well stocked. When we arrived, I ordered a cappuccino and my boyfriend had a beer. He didn't like the beer very much so he downed it quickly and we ordered mojitos. I got the blood orange while he had the mango. I liked the tartness of the blood orange and the texture was nice- like it had some pulp in it which I enjoy. The mango mojito was a bit too sweet, though. We started with the tuna tartare. Obviously stuffed into a tuna can and flipped onto the plate, it's layers of fresh tuna with mango, avocado and a little seasoning plus some taro chips to scoop with. This was a highlight to the meal. After the tartare we had the ham and cheese croquettes. They came in a serving of 3, which I thought was odd. They looked slightly burnt on the outside but were creamy and tasty on the inside. The sauce was rich, but the portion size was awkward and a bit small. The risotto balls at Ferraro's or croquettes elsewhere are better.Then came the sirloin sliders. Tasty, but not particularly memorable. The crispy duck was burnt and had too much sesame. Not something I'd order again and a bit disappointing. The portion was small and it was sloppily sliced. The lamb chops with lentils were the other highlight. The meat was tender and the lentils with veggies were flavorful. The portion was small but balanced by the lentils. The mushooms stuffed with chicken and chorizo were boring. We didn't like the cheese on top and the chorizo flavor was weak. Not something we'd order again.Overall, it ended up being expensive for what was essentially fancy bar food. I might give them a second chance some day and try the other dishes I hadn't gotten to sample, but I'm in no hurry. We weren't impressed.
5	Was just in Vegas first Monday night football  at Happy hour and boy was I happy ok more like extremely happy the food the bartender Aaron and the drinks! Were absolutely fantastic! Ive been there before but if at all possible better than the first time! I'm a Veg Head now and everything was out of this world... Mojitos OK omg! Ill jus say blueberry! Aaron rocked our mojito world! OK i say one more Paradise took me to the Bahamas in seconds! Everything on the menu amazing you cant go wrong! Thanks to Rachel Rays $40 a day from yrs ago I'm glad I found this spot locals are sooooooo LUCKY! Thank you Firefly  and Aaron for a wonderful meal and fabulous drinks!
5	Off the strip and on point.  This place simply rocks when it comes to good tapas style food.  We went there twice during our stay, and if I had more time, I would have gone back a third time.  We have had about 15 different dishes, and only two were in the "average" range, and I use that in comparison to the rest of the dishes.  The standouts for me were the stuffed dates, the stuffed peppers, and the pork empanadas.  But I must also mention the chocolate tres leches cake.  Holy Moist Cake, Batman!  This was an excellent dessert.  Very rich and decadent, so you need to leave a little room for it.They also have a homemade sangria that was really tasty.  I am not much of a sangria fan, but I enjoyed the sips from my wife's glass.  If you are even considering a sangria, get it.Service was really good.  Very attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere fits the mood of the food, with some very attractive paintings that look a lot like Asencio, but not quite.  There were quite a few couples here, and the atmosphere is very inviting for a romantic evening.  Great place to impress a date. :)Make a point to come here.
3	My overall experience here was a pleasant one! Service was exceptional (THANKS JESUS!), food was excellent & the atmosphere was far from the norm. Upon arrival, they start you off with a mini loaf of toasted sliced bread, a little bit of almond butter, & green olives. DELICIOUS! I didn't want to completely fill up on bread, but I was easily tempted. My favorite dish was the Veggie Empanadas! Absolutely the most hearty & savory out of all the plates we tried. Each bite was flaky, creamy & warm. In nature, I barely like any of the veggies that are apart of the stuffing. Thanks to these empanadas, I'll be giving mushrooms another chance! The Passion Fruit Mini Cheesecakes came in at a very close second place. The thickness of each little bite threw my taste buds for a loop- the exciting kind, like on rollercoasters! My only complaint is that some the portions could have been a little more robust. I'm well versed on the whole concept of tapas being small plates, but I feel like the big & thick flavors of a dish should make up for that. With only 1 drawback, I think my lunch at FIREFLY* was a success! I can't wait to go back & try more things!!!
5	The food was so good that I decided to start writing reviews on Yelp. The garlic shrimp was amazing! The Sangria with sparkling wine was great (I love girly drinks). We also had the filet mignon burger, lamb skewers, fries and another one of the meat skewers among three girls and the food was more than enough. They were all good but definitely recommend the garlic shrimp!
4	The food was very good, although I'm not sure you'd find "sliders" at a tapas bar in Spain. But, you know what, the sliders were good. So, "Yay, I'm a fan." Make sure you order a pitcher or Sangria. Be prepared for a wait. We saw people waiting outside for about an hour.
3	Food - 4 starsAmbiance - 4 starsService - 2 starsThe good news - Firefly offers very tasty food at extremely reasonable prices and pretty big portions (way too big to be classified as actual tapas, but this is a good thing if you feel like tapas are too small, or if you have more than 2-3 people, which we did).  They have an excellent sparkling sangria (they have red & white too) which is also reasonably priced. The patio has a nice, relaxing vibe and the inside looked pretty cute too. Standouts:Bacon wrapped stuffed dates- Machengo mac & cheeseFirefly friesThat almond butter that comes with the bread Good:PaellaTuna Tartare (I like that they use taro chips)MeatballsSausage plateOK:Sardine toastsBread with tomatoesClams and chorizooctopus saladIf the service wasn't so lackluster I would have given them 4 stars. Our waiter must have taken too many bong hits before his shift, because he was spacey as hell. He wasn't forthcoming with suggestions even though I asked him for some. And he must have been too high to realize, when we ordered all of our food, and I mean all of it, (do you see the list above?!) , that we didn't want all of it at one time.  He went away, I lit a cigarette, and one puff later, all of the dishes came out. My eyes made my stomach full pretty much instantly. The table groaned under the weight of our food. It didn't help when the rest of our party showed up and they had no room for plates- and then they told us that waiters ALWAYS tell them in the beginning to order a little at a time because it comes out very, very fast.Then, as we worked furiously to eat so we could clear  some plates away....he never came to check on us and clear our plates. We had to flag the busboys down to make room, which I hate doing. He never brought out our stuffed mushrooms, but after trying to eat all of the food up above, I could care less. He came to check on us once, asked if we wanted a sangria pitcher, and then when we said we would wait until he had more room, he finally looked at the table and realized we had been there for 15 minutes and had dishes almost hanging off. "Oh...I'll see if anything is left and if it is I'll tell them to wait a bit". Um, thanks asshole. A little too late.The chocolate tres leches cake was ok, but it was more like chocolate cake with some condensed milk thrown on top. There was no distinct layers of milk. My friend asked for cream for her coffee and he thought she wanted another cup and it took her 4 tries of saying cream before he got it. Seriously Firefly - you can feed me anyday. But start making sure your servers aren't stoned first.
5	I loved this restaurant! The environment was very conducive for a Bachelorette party. We were able to laugh, joke, talk, and not worry about disturbing others. I loved the pitchers of Mojitos and Sangria. VERY affordable. The waiting staff was very friendly and very quick in their service. I loved the way they delivered the food....food for every taste bud. Also, if you like trying new things..this was FREAKIN awesome!  Definitely a place I would go back to.
4	Terrific tapas!There wasn't one dish that disappointed me. I was expecting to question a few of the plates we ordered but not a single one was lower than my expectations. In fact, most of them wow'd my taste buds. Mushroom and steak skewers were by far the tastiest dish of the evening. That sauce they are cooked in is absolutely amazing. Shrimp ceviche / tuna tartare were also very good. The mango salsa was a nice touch to the tartare and the tiger prawns in the ceviche really pleased the senses. Chorizo and chicken stuffed shrooms, I love you. Don't forget the delicious pitchers of mojitos and the firefly fries!
5	My meal at Firefly was the best in Vegas by far. I went with a couple girlfriends and from what I remember, we ordered:- Firefly*fries (fairly good)- Terra y Mare skewers (good)- Filet mignon sliders (delicious!)THE BEST dish was:- Camarones al ajillo (shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce)The sangria comes in red, white, and sparkling wine - I've tried all three before and sparkling is my favorite. The shrimp (as mentioned above) was so delicious it really blew us all away. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the wait was not long for us (5 mins) for a Saturday night in September.
2	I have eaten here once and refuse to go back; not because of the food (which was great) but because of the service, which was TERRIBLE. Our food took forever to arrive and when my friend went up to use the bathroom, the server snatched her plate away before I could say a word. I'm sorry, but when you are dropping 30-40 bucks between several small plates of food you should be able to actually EAT IT. We left a decent tip (20%) but as we were getting ready to go I saw our server talking to another server, pointing at us and his tip and smirking, like we didn't give him enough. He was lucky he got anything at all.  The only reason I don't give this place 1 star is because the food itself was very good. But from reading the reviews it sounds like the service here has been a problem for others as well.
4	Mmmmm tapas!!! Wait, did you say topless?! TAPAS! Appetizers, appetizers appetizers.... What's up with all the hate?? I love this place! I have been here plenty of times, but have yet to put in a review... why? I don't know.. I haven't been here in a while, so bear with me on the names of these tapas dishes.. So far my list my group has had: Drinks: Watermelon mojitos, regular mojitos, and mango mojitos. Food: Salted peppers (this is vague, but i really don't remember the name), Thai beef salad, chorizo and clams, mac n cheese, fire fries, vegetable empanadas, stuffed dates, Terra y mare skewers, Dessert: Passion fruit cheesecake, nutella sandwiches, Tresa leches cake Of these what I recommend: WATERMELON MOJITOS, sooo good. I may be biased for my love of mojitos, but this is the perfect drink for sitting on the crowded patio in the summer months. The chorizo and clams is really good, the flavor of the chorizo creates an amazing flavor to go along with the clams, and it comes with bread for dipping in the leftover broth. And for dessert, I feel they are ALL incredible (I would come here just for drinks and dessert), but I think the cheesecakes are amazing, so tiny, but bursting with flavor and the perfect cheesecake-y creaminess. I would like to call it the best cheesecake I have ever had;] I have seen a lot of comments on the service... but I feel this is unjust. This joint is for large groups in my opinion. I don't feel this is good for a one on one date: it's loud, distracting, and lively. Come here with a large group of friends, get a pitcher of drinks, order a large amount of appetizers, and that should set you straight for your entire visit. The atmosphere is boisterous... and loud, and fun! Do you want your waiter chiming in when your yelling at your friends across the table??? Noooo. So, order in large amounts, trust me, it will get eaten.. No worry for wasting of food here.
5	This place is absolutely amazing! I went with five friends and we each ordered two things off the menu and we also had a pitcher of Sangria. Everything was full of amazing flavor! This place is a must if you're heading out to Vegas. Our check ended up at only $90. Not bad at all. We stayed at the Hard Rock which isn't too far away from this place. Also, our service rocked!
5	went here with some friends from back home. theyre regulars here when theyre in town, and since ive never been and heard nothing but good things, i had to check it out.we were actually at nu sanctuary before we went to firefly, and out of curiosity pulled up the menu on my blackberry. everything sounded soooo good! and because they have TONS of different tapas, we were able to order a bunch of different ones and share them.we got there after our friends did, and we were greeted fairly quickly. service was great throughout the entire meal. we ordered maybe 6 or 7 different tapas and of course, had to make room for dessert (i saw a banana nutella sandwich on the menu and had to save room for it. then again, who am i kidding? theres ALWAYS room for dessert!). every dish was so tasty! the mac and cheese, chorizo clams, artichoke toasts, everything we ordered was great! best part though, was the dessert. a few days later i tried to make one at home, and it just wasnt the same.i will definitely be back soon for dessert and all the other yummy tapas.
4	I love the fact that you just order different appetizer sized plates and share it with whomever is with you.Let's see... so I tried: Ceviche of shrimp: pretty good... standard ceviche. Nice and tart.Terra y Mare skewers: these were pretty awesome.  Cooked nicely and in a great seasoning.Steamed Mussels: LOVE these. You make yourself a total mess, but it's totally worth it.Pulpo Asado: the octopus was cooked VERY nicely.  Not rubbery at all and the seasoning on the dish was beautiful.Ahi Tuna Skewer: just as great as the rest of them.  Tuna was cooked well done, and the mango next to them definitely added a tart.Tips:It is super duper busy... even on a Sunday night at 10pm.  Call me small town, but holy smokes.It's pretty cramped inside, but the decor is really cool with deep colored lighting.
5	AWESOME!! Loved Firefly and can't wait to go back!! tried a several dishes and enjoyed a sparkling Sangaria. My wife had a mojito tha twas also very good. I wish we saved room for some of the desserts. Service was excellant and the food came out very quickly on a very busy night, which i'm sure most of them are! Here are some of the items we had:Tuna PeppersRoasted Baby beet saladTuna TartareRoasted Eggplant CannelloniMushroom TartFirefly FriesCrispy Duck Rolls.The Duck rolls were my favorite and the fries..WOW
4	Firefly delivers great tapas at a prime location, just off the strip on Paradise Road. Everything on their extensive tapas menu is great. The actual venue is just average, but that is acceptable given the spot-on service and great food. My favorites are the eggplant cannelloni and the dates.
4	Great food.  The reviews that mentioned spotty service did not apply to me.  I had great service from a friendly waiter.We arrived early on a Friday night... I think at 6 pm.  No wait!!!  WTF?!  I guess it's a Tapas place, so people are coming later to get shitfaced.  Well, I was kinda right.  15 minutes later the place was packed.  We got lucky!The servers came promptly and we mentioned to him that it was our first time.  We got a pitcher of red sangria to start off and when he came back we started ordering.  After we finished our first round he promptly came and we ordered a second round from him.  When we asked for suggestions, he was very friendly and patiently told us his favorites as well as popular items.+the red sangria was amazing.  It wans't watered down and it's been marinading for three days.  You can taste the sweetness of the fruits mixed with the wine.  It was the best sangria I've ever had.+Stuffed dates... as other Yelpers mentioned, this was great.  The waiter mentioned that this was one of the most popular dish.  The sweetness may have been a bit too much, but the almond was there to give it a bang at the end as well as another needed texture to go with the crisp bacon and the soft dates.+Crispy duck rolls:  These were one of my favorites.  Just make sure you eat it before it gets soggy haha.  The duck was grounded up, it was made basically like an egg roll.  The hoisin sauce they had with it made it great.+Something peppers.  Red peppers with the cheese.... wow.  I usually demand meat in my dishes, but this did not make me regret getting a meat free dish.+/-Fillet sliders... I guess this wans't anything special  I mean they could have used sirloin or chuck and it would've been fine.  Why grind up fillet which is already tender?+/-Paella was OK.  Nothing special.  A bit overpriced if anything, but you gotta have your paella with tapas+/-Smoked salmon toast.  The smoked salmon part was good.  The fact that the toast was not crispy at all ruined it.I had many other things that were great also.  But these were my favorites or the items I felt needed to be mentioned.  For 5 people including two pitchers of sangria (for $26/pitcher) the bill came out to be around $130 pretip.  I'll be going back!
4	On one of our annual trips to Vegas to visit my mom, my husband and I stayed at the Platinum one night (great!), and had lunch at Firefly.  My girlfriend had been urging me for several years to go to Firefly, so I finally had an opportunity.  Very friendly service, no complaints about our waiter.  It was a weekday so the only folks there were from the local area on their lunch break, no wait at all.  We ordered at least one tapas from each section of the menu.  The only dish I would say I was a little disappointed in was the Tuna Tartare, it was cut a little thick for my taste, and as a whole it was kind of blah, for me at least.  The duck rolls and the filet mignon sliders were delicious.  The fresh bread and almond butter they bring to the table is really really good btw (crushed almonds mixed into the butter).The highlight of the meal was dessert.  Since we were there for lunch we were supposed to get ice creams or something as part of a lunch special, but they were out, so they let us pick a dish off the menu.  We chose the Banana-Nutella Sandwiches.  It took our breath away!  Unlike anything we have ever had before.  Splendiferous.  I totally recommend that even if you don't have a meal here and just want to get a cup of coffee and dessert, this would be the dish to get!  Trust me on this one.We will definitely be back.  Great meal overall.
5	This is the best tapas restaurant I've been to in the U.S. The food here is really outstanding and the sangria was perfect. I also concur with other Yelpers that the bacon wrapped dates was the best dish on the menu. The combination of sweet, nuttiness, and savory was just so unusual and unexpected. It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party. The atmosphere was intimate and fun. Even on a Sunday night, there were hardly any table to spare, including the outside balcony area. Sort of a youngish, hip crowd. We ordered practically everything on the menu, since we wouldn't have a chance to go there very often being out-of-towners. It's really refreshing to eat off of the Vegas Strip. A few key points:-Very good food-Yummy Sangria-The price is unbeatable (6 people and the bill came to $136)-Good vibe/ambiance-Friendly serviceTwo thumbs up and a wink!
5	Such a refreshing change from the over-hyped, over-glytzed and over-priced iron chef restaurants at the casinos. This is the closest to my memory of having Tapas in Spain almost a decade ago. Firefly offers about 50 diverse selections and seating are comfy sofa arrangements. Simply, Firefly is awesome. Came here w/ 3 colleagues and tried about a dozen dishes. 4 is the perfect size because this allowed us to try the maximum number of dishes. Let's see: Bacon wrapped dates - best dish of all. so much better than ones we recently tried from BOTG Truck Artichoke toasts - hhhmmmm, great great great Stuffed peppers - sweet red peppers with mozzarella and a creamy sauce - fab combo Empanada - crust was not as flaky but pork stuffing was great Steak & mushroom skewer - meat a little tough but nice flavor Fried calamari - not overly battered and delish dipping sauce Shrimp tempura - hardly any batter - not like the ones you get at J-restaurants Beet salad - beets could be more plentiful. Just ordinary. Ceviche shrimp - too liquidity and not enough shrimp
4	I finally tried this place out on Saturday night. Parking lot was a nightmare..check in w/hostess looks like 30min wait. No biggie. We hit the bar and order up a pitcher of watermelon mojitos. They were sooo yummy! Sat at bar enjoying the scene til the table was ready. Finally the food is being brought out..pretty fast actually for how jam packed the place was. We had the croquet's, tuna tartar, shrimp chiveche and lamb skewers.  Almost everything was really good. The shrimp was actually deserving of 5 stars. The only thing I didn't  care or was the tuna..it was like a bland poke salad. The lamb was seasoned perfect and was tender. The croquets melted in your mouth. Service was good. I can't wait to come back here!! It had a great vibe for sure.
4	Started this past Saturday night out at Firefly for some drinks and a light meal before hitting the clubs. We arrived sometime between 7:30 and 8, couldn't find a parking spot anywhere near the actual restaurant. Ended up parking at the medical plaza behind the strip mall that Firefly is in, there was a lot of parking available back there. The hostess working was both adorable and friendly, she informed us it would be about a 30 minute wait and invites us to have a drink in the bar area. I had read a few reviews raving about the watermelon mojitos so that is what I decided to order... As soon as I did Dawn C. looked over at me with wide eyes and said YUM, ME TOO! so we decided to go with the pitcher instead. Pitchers are definitely the way to go, $30 for what ended up being 3-4 drinks each. The mojitos were the perfect amount of sweetness, went down so easy. 30 minutes flew by and the hostess found us in the bar area and took us to our seats outside. October evenings are beautiful here in Vegas, just cool enough to be enjoyable without needing a jacket. While we were waiting in the bar area, Dawn C. and I had talked a bit about what we were thinking about ordering, based on the reviews we had read. Once we were seated and had menus to look over we finalized our decision, and went with: Tuna tartar - Disappointing. This was one I wanted to order and it was pretty bland. The mangos were the best part. I would not order this again.Lamb skewers - Dawn C picked these and I was glad she did. I don't eat much lamb but these make me want to. Ham and cheese croquettes - Mmmm. Only bad part is they only serve you 3. So creamy and good. Would order again. Shrimp Ceviche - Some of the best ceviche I have had in a long time. The shrimp were sweet, the citrusy marinade complimented them perfectly. Would also order this again.Total for the food was around $30, plus the $30 pitcher makes for a not bad cost for a nice dinner out. Firefly is a place I'd definitely go back to on a date or with a group of friends.
4	Firefly had a pretty diverse menu, with some traditional favorites and some more trendy picks.  Five dishes was about the right number for the two of us, who were hungry but not starving.  We each had a glass of wine and an after dinner digestif, and ended up at about $80. The atmosphere is casual, and portions are ample.Mussels: Very tasty in a coconut curry broth, served with bread to soak up the goodnessTuna Peppers: probably the lowlight. We're big fans of peppadews, but they were pretty much just stuffed with canned tuna, drizzled with oil, and plated. Disappointing.Lamb Chops: cooked perfectly, interesting side with lentils and veggiesStuffed Dates: YUM! Everything they should be.Pulpo Asado: very tender octopus, pretty flavorfulWe ordered the sliders, and they showed up on the bill, but never came out. We were already getting full by the time we noticed, and the server was apologetic and gracious about taking it off the bill.
5	Firefly is a must when I go to Las Vegas. Speedy service, AMAZING manchego mac n' cheese and red house-made sangria.  Everything is super yummy!  Honestly better food and better prices than most other spanish/latin/mexican places on the strip.
5	YUMMMMM. One of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to Vegas and I keep going back!  Best part.. they went from 1 to 3 locations and one just opened up a mile from our house!  Great tapas, good service, amazing drinks and decent prices for LV. The dates are my absolute favorite.. can you mess up something that has bacon, blue cheese and almonds in it? Not in my book! Other great choices include, but are definitely not limited to Camarones a la Diabla, Albondigas, Manchengo Mac n Cheese, Stuffed Peppers, Padron Peppers.  It's so hard to make a decision!
5	To give this place a thorough review, I really need to go back again, but I was so happy with my first visit here, I feel compelled.  On a Thursday night, a group of girls were getting together here for happy hour.  Aaron the bartender started early in the little overflow room, so we got there at 5 p.m.I didn't eat much, but I did try the bacon wrapped dates (holy cow, this is amazing) and a meatball.  The meatball was aight, but dang, that date was orgasmic.  I love dates, but this took it to a whole new level.  Really really good.  Now on to what I did have a lot of: drinks!  Firefly has sangria in so many many flavors, but I opted for the flavored mojito.  I ordered passionfruit, but Aaron also offered a few samples of blueberry and raspberry mojito.  All really good and I don't even like raspberry.  This place really lives up to the hype.  Great food, great drinks and an awesome bartender: Aaron.  If you haven't been, you've got to go.  I can't believe I waited so long.  I plan on making Firefly a regular pit stop.
4	YUMM! Solid 4 stars. Came here on a Sunday for an early dinner; there was no wait and we got seated right away. Our waiter was really friendly and helpful. We got 6 or 7 dishes if i remember correctly and a pitcher of sangria (must have) and the bill came out to about $25 pp for 4. Very affordable and i was stuffed! My favorite dishes were the merguez and the paella but that might be because it reminded me of the food I used to eat in France. The bf really liked the camajones a diablo. The sauce was soooo good! We had to keep asking for bread and wiped that plate clean! Haha The ambiance was nice, modern and dim and they had a patio to sit outside. I  wanna go back and try more dishes!!So glad we skipped the buffets and came here instead!! I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was such delicious food away from the strip! We took a cab and the fare was about $13 from PH, not too bad. Our cab driver told us Firefly was one of his fav restaurant in LV and gave us a list of other local places to try too. Def need to check them out next time!
4	We visited Firefly on Paradise last week for lunch. We ordered paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage], Pulpo asado [marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato], and Terra y Mare skewers [grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]. They all tasted good, except that we are not fond of pulpo asado as much. In general we like the food and the service was great. Everyone there was courteous and polite, and make you feel very comfortable and make the meal more enjoyable that way. We like it here for a casual lunch. =)
4	I wouldn't say come here to get into a food coma, but the food is certainly good the taste buds. It's good for like lounging with some friends and having a light dinner. The mood is pretty chill. It's pretty much dim inside, talk about blind date. Don't get me wrong cus in simple words, this place is good. And I'm definitely ready to go back. Especially since now they have one in Summerlin :)
4	i was a little confused on how to write this review, but at the end of the day everything turned out the way i wanted it to.after my first visit, i decided i wanted to come back for my 25th bday dinner. there was about 20 of us, so i decided to call and make a reservation. tip: any reservations over 10 people require a $25/person minimum, and they have a few set menus you can choose from. as a college student, that $25 doesnt always work for everyone there. so i asked if there was anyway to go around it, and the reasoning didnt make any sense at all - she said they require a set menu because a party of 10 or more would slow the kitchen. as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years, that was not sitting well with me. then she offered a mini menu with no minimum, but that would restrict us from ordering from their full menu, and a lot of the items i would order were not on the mini menu. i ended up asking how long the wait would be (approximately) if we were to walk in, and she said depending on the time, expect a little bit of a wait.that day of, i called and asked what my best time to come in was, and the host said to just call 15 minutes before coming in and she'll set something up [i guess they opened up the private dining room and there was room for us there]. we came in around 30 minutes before we expected people to start showing up, and she was able to set a table for us right away. we waited no more than 10 minutes.service was great. food was great. the house infused vodka was really good!!! and of course - i got a birthday flan :]all in all - the place is still a fave out here. even with the reservation drama, still love the food and the service.*edit: TOTALLY forgot about this part...but towards the end of our meal, it was probably around 10:30, our server dropped the check. and i mentioned people were still on their way, and she said that side of the restaurant closes early and there may not be any space for everyone on the other side. part of the reason why i chose to come here was because its open late. had i known that side closed early, i would have waited for seating on the other side of the restaurant. thats why i deducted a star
4	The sangria is excellent, the appetizers I had during a tour event stop were also freshly made and delicious. The appetizers and drinks were complimentary to the tour event that I was on. Many kinds of food types for all tastes were available.I would go back with no more than four people. The restaurant seems to have a smaller overall space and it gets very busy starting on Friday, lasting through the weekend. I would also only do a late lunch or a super early dinner because the restaurant quickly fills up starting at dinner time.If this location is super busy, you may also visit their second location in the Downtown Las Vegas Fremont Street Experience.
4	Murda'd nearly the whole menu from the Empandas to the Chocolate "tres leches" cake.  Simply scrumptious!
4	The bar at Firefly on Paradise is a great comfortable place for the single business traveler.  The bartenders are friendly (and cute), and they keep my sangria glass full.  The tapas makes a wonderful way to try a few different things when eating alone.  I found the dates a little sweet and greasy after the much lighter tuna tartare, but I think that was just a pairing snafu. I loved the tomato soup and grilled brie sandwich.I took my colleagues to lunch at Firefly on Sahara - it just didn't have the same vibe.  Maybe it's because we passed on the Sangria - but the tapas just didn't seem to taste as good there for some reason.I will be going back -
5	still great small inexpensive plates...
5	Great atmosphere, food, and drinks--the sangria is awesome. A little off the strip and reasonable pricing. Small plates make it fun to try a little of everything. The Thai beef salad and beef and mushroom skewers are always a must.Definitely a great place to bring friends when they come into town. Always a good time :) Cheers!
5	Dropped by for a quick bite to eat after the show before we went casino hopping.Here are a few more items i would definitely recommend:-Tuna tartare -Manchego mac 'n' cheese-Terra y Mare skewers Go here for the description:http://www.usmenuguide.com/fireflymenu.htmlYUM!
4	GUSH GUSH GUSH I LOVE THIS PLACE.The atmosphere: Art Deco paintings hang in a red and black theme with a flamenco/latin flair.  Also has an outdoor patio out front.  The people: Locals, "alternative" scene, and performers/show people late night.The food: Tapas, obviously.  Many different things to choose from.  My last visit was with an old friend with a... limited palate, (let's say meat and potatoes kind of person), and it even worked with him.  Even if you're the type who's like, "Uh, sauce reductions?  Tartar?? Gimme a steak!" this place WILL work.  My particular favorites are the tuna tartar (just ask for additional crackers as they give you too few usually), crispy duck wonton, the ceviche, and the roasted eggplant cannelloni stuffed with goat cheese.  A note about their calamari: There's a mountain of it, so be prepared.The service is pretty prompt, the lighting is atmospheric, and the DRINKS:  Heck yeah.  Best Sangria in Vegas.  The Sangria served there is prepared a day or two in advance and the taste is fruity and well-rounded without tasting overly sweetened or artificial.   They come in red, white, and sparkling.  A pitcher is more than two drinks for two people, btw, so be prepared.  Also spazz-worthy are the infused mojitos, which includes my favorite, dragonfruit.  Open late and has something for everyone.  For a snack or for a fun, romantic evening, it's an excellent choice.
5	I normally do not use phrases like "it's the bomb!" or "off the hook" unless I'm talking about an actual bomb or an article of clothing that has fallen to the floor, respectively, but this place was both. The best way to go at any tapas place is to order 5-6 dishes and share. You can always order more if you're hungry. If my wine-soaked brain recalls correctly, we had: eggplant cannoli (the name escapes me, but the dish is rolled eggplant and goat chees); fries; pulpo asado (octopus), chicken salad, and the veggies and lentils (probably my favorite). We also split a tres leches cake, but that was pretty forgettable. If you go to Vegas, you really need to go here. It's a hip place with a good vibe and interesting people.
3	i do love the food here. i have been here a few times and everytime the service just gets me. i understand it is a busy restaurant but pay attention to your customers. we are the ones leaving you your tip. now like i said i love the food but for service purposes i would rather just eat tapas at barcelona tapas & bar and that is why i give it 3 stars.if you do venture to firefly despite the snobby service i would make sure to try the tuna tartare. it is very sweet and something i always would get. the stuffed dates which are full of flavor. terra y mare skewers were great and i got to taste three different meats. the filet mignon sliders with firefly fries are pretty good and basic if you are afraid to let your taste buds explore. i also really like the empanadas. it had a little spice to it which won me. i also like their infused vodka. you can really taste the berries and lychees, but beware because they hit you fast.i hope everyone else that goes here gets better service than i have. enjoy their food and drinks!
5	if you're in Vegas & want to go to a good nightspot a little off the strip with good food & good atmosphere.. go here, you won't be disappointed. try the mac & cheese.. the best!
5	When it comes to food and drink, this place is top notch in Vegas. They have sangrias and mojitos that are simply the best. Food - heaven.
5	I love this place - one of my top 5 restaurants ever. Reasonably priced, small portions allow you to try several different items. From the stuffed dates to the notorious mojitos - everything I have had here makes me feel like that cartoon dog who floats in the air and grabs his stomach saying MMMMM MMMMM when he gets a treat.
4	I love this place. I have been here twice during business trips, and I wish the Reno area would have this restaurant or one very similar to it. They have amazing sangria. I have only had the red sangria, but it is very delicious. I only wish the fruit was a tad larger, so I could enjoy it more when my glass is finished.I love the artichoke hearts. They are the perfect starter. The ceviche of shrimp is fresh and very flavorful. The terra y mare skewers were one of my favorites there. Packed with flavor and the salsa verde on them adds the perfect touch. The sliders are amazing. The mac 'n' cheese is divine. The babyback ribs fall off the bone. The only thing I have had so far that I really didn't care for was the empanada.For dessert I had the gelato. I love gelato and since they had pistachio, they already won me over before tasting it. The gelato comes with a very tasty biscotti treat.
3	love this place. love the food. this time - the only thing giving this place 3 stars is the foodi took my 2 girlfriends and my sister here after we saw le reve. there was a little bit of a wait, probably about 20 minutes. we sat outside near the door, which is the worst table ever! if it werent for the heaters, we would have froze out there! maybe it was because we were hungry and a little cranky, but it felt like everything from water service to actually taking out order took forever. the food came out in a fairly timely manner, but out server forgot about the patatas bravas we ordered, which my sister was stoked about because they its a traditional spanish tapa.i must say - the busser was awesome! very attentive with the water refills and pre-bussing. she even brought new plates and forks for our dessert!we ordered:smoked salmon toastsshrimp cevichetuna tartarestuffed datesthai beef saladmanchego mac n cheesealbondigaschicken and chorizo stuffed mushroomslamb skewersbanana nutella sandwichthe table by the door sucks because the door would hit my chair anytime someone went in or out.needless to say, this was one of my worst experiences here. the food is definitely gonna bring me back though!
4	I really love this place! Get a group of friends out here, order a few things and share! Now that's what I call a social scene! I love the atmosphere of this scene, it's very loud, fast paced, and out going.  People who come here, come here to have a good time and that's what I get.  A good time.  The food here is great, I love the flavor that's incorporated into each dish.  The only thing that gets me here, is the prices.  You pay almost $10 for tapas, usually made for 3 to 4 people.  That's why I suggest you go with a group of 10 and split the check.  Now that sounds like a good time to me.
5	Just order these and you'll be set!Must-haves:Pitcher of white sangria (easily 4 full glasses, maybe 5-6 since there's a lot of ice as a filler. But still a better deal than ordering by the glass.)Stuffed Dates (Order two! Since it comes with only 5, you will be fighting over who gets the last one! Trust me.)Filet Mignon sliders (Expensive for two small sliders, but soo worth it. You'll love the fried struggle onions so much, you can eat it alone.)Empanadas (Comes in two. Order as much as needed.)Mac & Cheese (Filling and comforting before a night of drinking on the town.)You'll get almond butter with garlic bread & olives on the house. The almond butter alone is a ball of butter goodness!
4	Great spot just off the strip for dinner.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night and the energy was great.  Here's a quick breakdown of the food:- Stuffed dates are a must.  By far the best dish we tried- Mac and cheese is good but there was a layer of cheese on top that was too thick- Albondigas were decent- White sangria was outstanding.  Must order a pitcher of this!Prices are great compared to most Tapas places and the atmosphere is fun.  I'm definitely going back soon.
4	Diggin' this tapas restaurant.  Walked in and it was kinda dark.  Staff was pretty friendly and helpful.  There were 6 of us and we were seated pretty quickly.  We sat at like a big rectangle coffee table with a sectional on one side and a couple of cushioned cubes on the other.  Real casual and relaxing.  Perfect for tapas, sangria, and hanging with the friends.  We were feeling a good from the sangria.  You have to get this.  We got a couple of pitchers of the red.  It was good.  Real good.  I think too good.  ;)  We knew we wanted to the stuffed dates.  Stuffed with bleu cheese and an almond, wrapped in bacon and drizzled with a red win reduction.  Yeah, we got more than one order.  A lot more.  The rest we just told our server to bring us his favorites.  There was the artichoke toasts which we liked.  The steak and mushroom skewers, nice.  Paella was pretty good.  The Fillet Mignon sliders were not bad but the crispy onion rings on that plate was light, crispy and delicious.  And a lot of others that the sangria made me forget.  Great place to eat some good food and hang out with your friends.  Coming back here for sure.
5	Honestly amazing. Awesome sangria. Reasonably priced. Great atmosphere. Bacon wrapped dates!! One of my favorite  restaurants in Vegas for sure!
4	Firefly is a great tapas restaurant off the strip and away from all the hustle and bustle. Don't let that fool you, its good food and drinks still attract a ton of people, so don't be surprised if there is a wait. The food was all very good and comes out quickly. A mix between coffee table type settings, regular dining table, and bar settings make this good for groups of different size and different levels of intimacy.mini filet sliders 7.5empanadas pork 4.5beet salad 5.5seafood paella 15sangria 6/cup
4	Great atmosphere! Great service and they are open late! I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys tapas. My GF and I had 3 different dishes, they all came out quick even though it was a Saturday night and busy. There are so many options here...I would come here again for sure. Its great for large groups or a small date.
3	I couldn't decide how many stars to give. It's a tough call because the food is great and, when split among friends, the prices aren't bad. However, we arrived when the place was packed, I got a shitty chair, our server screwed up our order, and we barely saw his face. I suppose three stars is fair because under better circumstances I'd be swooning for this place. To break these elements down... Wait- The interior, bar, and patio were completely packed, which caused parking to be extremely limited and the wait for a table to be a bit long. 20 minutes in the cold makes the wait questionable. It was so packed that a woman, presumably a regular, walked up to the door and screamed, "OH HELLLLLL NOOOOO, this place better not be packed!" (A minute later she sat on a bench outside, annoyed.)The seating- My girlfriends are I were seated outside on the patio. The good news was that we were next to a heater, which was much appreciated. The bad news was that our table was pushed up against the glass wall in such a way that I had to do the bendies to squish myself into my chair which, by the way, was lopsided so that I kept smacking into the wall as I ate. We were also right by the door so every time someone walked into the patio my sister got smacked in the back of her seat. In the future, I suggest waiting a little longer for a seat inside the restaurant. Our server- Granted, I'm sure he was getting worked, but he gave off a cocky vibe and didn't even write down our order. Amazingly enough most of our items came out... except for one. We got to the end of our meal, ready to order our dessert, and requested that since the last item was clearly not coming that he cancel the order. Instead of cancelling it, he said he'd check on it and if it weren't cooked already, he'd cancel it. We didn't hear about that item until the bill arrived about 20 minutes later and he said, "Oh. Yeah, so I cancelled that item." The redeeming quality: The food- Delicious. So much flavor packed into small bites. Our little girlfriends party of 4 scarfed down:- Smoked Salmon Toasts- CevicheWonderfully tangy and fresh - Tuna Tartare- Bacon-Wrapped DatesRidiculously addictive with a happy almond crunch on the inside - Mac and CheeseCreamy and cheesy and evil and tasty- Albondigas- Lamb Skewers w/Lentils- Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms - Thai Beef Salad The surprise item and star of the evening. Ridiculously good and large enough for a small meal for one!- Banana Nutella SandwichI didn't get to try the sangria, but I intend to on my next visit to Vegas. I also plan on trying to Happy Hour on for size, with fingers crossed for a better table!
5	Out of all the Firefly's in Vegas, this is still the best one. Serious local hang. Cheap, quality food. I eat here three times a week.
4	This place was pretty awesome! I have to go to LV for work each week and one of my sales reps took us here because I said drinks and happy hour apps were on me.  Well,,,,,, I am so happy he picked this place.  It beats any of the stuffy hotel restaurants I have been going to during my stays.  The red wine sangria is soooo yummy and even better when they serve it in pitchers.  We had a ton of their tapas and three pitchers and the price was so reasonable.  I was ecstatic. We sat at the bar and the bartender was pleasant and very helpful. The sliders were super tasty along with the calamari and the tuna tar tare thing.  Yummy.  We had so much stuff along with a complementary tapas sampler that was very good.  I know want to come back here every time I am out in LV for work.
5	Love love love this place.Food: Stuffed dates-blue cheese stuffed and wrapped with bacon. What? You can't go wrong with these bad boys. Ham & Cheese Croquetas-just your basic ham and cheese popper, right? I think not.  I loved these.Pulpo Asado-pretty good. Not great. Perhaps a tad bit overdone, not sure.  Roasted eggplant cannelloni-light and fresh. Filet mignon sliders-tasty and substantial. Service: Great. No wait on a Friday night, but then again, it was around midnight.Attentive waiters, quick food turnaround.  Price: Each dish can run anywhere from $4 to $10 for the tapas and since you'll be ordering quite a few, it can get a bit pricey.  Throw in a pitcher of the must have sangria for $24 and you've got yourself quite the bill.  Still, in the town of excess, this is still a bargain.  This is definitely a must try place.
3	Vegas food doesn't impress me too much but this is off the strip and good. One star off for bad/slow service. Another star off since the food is good but it wasn't too memorable. The only thing I can remember (and the reason why we went) was the stuffed dates (get that).
5	It's New Year's Eve and there's a lot on the agenda. Deciding where to eat before the major festivities begin is no easy feat. After hours (ok, maybe minutes) of research, we landed on Firefly and it did more than fit the bill for the occasion (which just happened to be my birthday too!) A group of 12 of us sat down and everyone got wide eyes when we were handed the lengthy menu. It was a 25 dollar minimum per person which was not difficult to fulfill. We took to picking out a couple dishes each that we passed around the table and filled glasses with pitchers of red sangria and passionfruit mojitos and were anything but happy. With that many people, we were able to try so many different dishes. I couldn't avoid ordering my go-to tapas including the bacon-wrapped dates, patatas bravas and ham and cheese croquetas. Luckily others I was with ordered different things like the fresh tuna tartare, shrimp and filet skewers, mac n' cheese and vegetable empanadas. As if the food wasn't enough, the service was outstanding. On a busy night, they were nice enough to push tables together for us, clear our plates quickly and put candles on my birthday cake when the time came! Paying in big groups can sometimes be a headache, but they made it easy for us. When the time came to grab a taxi, they helped us with that too! Landing in a new city for your birthday can always be a little nerve wracking but I cannot imagine a place that would have been better at leaving everyone able to find something they could enjoy!
4	Heard so much about them, so my boyfriend and I planned our date night there. Making reservations was hard, all the hostess told us was to call ahead. But even for 2 people, we still had to wait about 20 minutes on a chilly night. The wait was worth it though.It's a very social restaurant and can also be a romantic place to take a date, as it's very dark inside, with hints of lights from the table to the walls.Their stuff dates is really the business, that's all I can think about. My mouth is starting to water. Their mac and cheese hit close to home. And their paella was delish as well. Our other tapas was great but the dates and mac and cheese left a great impression. The portions are small which is great, because you get to try more things out on their menu. I loved, loved their complimentary bread and butter, their butter was different and my boyfriend isn't a big fan of things like that but he killed that before we even got to order. I was too shy to ask for seconds. I wish I could have ordered that to-go if the option was available.They do get pretty crowded and I now understand why. As one table cleared, it was filled back up shorty after. I will definitely be back.
5	Reading all those good reviews, we were hoping not to be disappointed by their food or service... and they proved us how great they were!  This place is now one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.It's located off the Strip but don't let that stop you from checking this place out.  It only takes about 5 minutes (or less) from the Strip.Well, before I go on, let me tell you one disappointment.  They have a website and I've email them directly via their email box on their "contact us" page and asked a quick question if they're open on Christmas Day or not which seemed to be completely ignored.  If they cannot reply, they shouldn't even bother to put "email us" section...That's been said, the rest of our Firefly experience was awesome.  Because they do not take reservations for smaller groups on weekends, we had to wait for about 15 minutes or so.  Once we're seated, we were greeted by a friendly waiter and other servers were attentive and helpful too.  We didn't wait too much for drinks and food.  Red sangria was delicious.  Just between my sister and I, we ordered about 10 items and pretty much everything was yummy.  The best dish was one of their cheapest tapas, bacon wrapped stuffed dates ($4).  It was so good, we ordered another one.  Later we went to a fancy award winning restaurant and ordered their $10 bacon wrapped dates but Firefly's stuffed dates were far better than the fancy pricy restaurant's!  The only so-so dish was their curry based mussels.  The coconut curry sauce and mussel combination didn't work for us.  However, it came with a couple of garlic toast and dipping it into the sauce was very delicious, so I can't say I didn't like it.  There are many more dishes and drinks I want to try so I'll definitely go back!
5	LOVED this place! We came here with friends that live in Las Vegas and they introduced us to this amazing place. I fell in love with the hoisin duck rolls, stuffed dates and the mac & cheese. It was also my first time having tres leches chocolate cake which was like an orgasm in my mouth! the sangria is delicous and they have soo many different types of mojitos there to try. The prices are excellent. I can't wait to go back!
1	This is the 2nd time I've been here.  The 1st time was two years ago when I was on leave from Iraq.  I came during lunch and sat at the bar.  Had a great time and the bartender treated me really well.  Food was fantastic-I mean I had better tapas here than I did in Madrid, Spain.Wanted to come back and swung on by on a Saturday night.  Real mistake on my part.  I didn't realize this was a hang-out place for the "hip" crowd.  OK, so I really detest the hip crowd but I didn't let this sway my opinion.I sat down at the bar and waited a bit and the bartender gave me a menu.  At the same time I ordered a glass of their red sangria which was recommended to me the 1st time and I really liked.  The red sangria is still really good.  So I perused the menu and it looked pretty much identical.  made a couple choices and waited.  Waited a bit more.  Finally the bartender comes to me and I mention that I haven't been here in 2 years.  Just as I was going to tell him my order he turns to help one of the waiters that comes up.  OK, np the bartender supports the waiters-I got this.  So I wait some more.  The bartender either completely forgets about me or ignores me.  I wait a while now, deciding to be a nice guy and try to give him another chance.  He takes someones else's order that walked up to the bar while I'm sitting at the bar.  I wait a good while and I'm finally feed-up.  Seriously?  I flip the menu over to see the price on my glass, put out exactly $6.50 for the drink on the bar and exit.  I was flabbergasted.  It's been a while since I've gotten this kind of treatment.  And the bar is really small.  There was me, and maybe 5 other people at this bar.  I'm thinking he just decided to blow me off.  Amazing.  I would have given this place 5 stars two years ago but now...Maybe in the future I'll revisit at lunchtime again and write an update for this place but until then, I guess I just wasn't hip enough for this place.
4	2nd time here. great food. fast service. great vegetarian items. This time we had patatas bravas and stuffed peppers, and both were great!
5	Best Tapas bar in Las Vegas and probably the best tapas bar I've ever been to in my life.All I can say is "Just Do It". Everything on this menu is good. Every dining experience I've had  at Firefly is been consistently and outstandingly great. I've been going to this place for the last 9 years. Make sure you make reservations. This place is constantly bombarded with crowds of parties coming in. Thank god the owner is my friend otherwise I'd be waiting for a looong time to be seated. Besides the fact the owner is my friend. This place is just f*cking great! Great food, great service, great music, great crowd, great sangria, But!! finding a parking spot in the plaza where the restaurant  is located sucks big thumbs down. haha Cheers to firefly for their food!
5	Hands down one of my favorite spots! I have damn near tried every tapa, entree, and flavored mojito they have to offer. I suggest Firefly to everyone! Dessert I can never get tired of is their tres leche. It is actually chocolate flavored. Weird because in the past I have always had a yellow cake soaked in "leche". I asked why theirs was chocolate... they said that's how it really is done in Mexico City, Mexico. Hey, guess they had it the extra authentic way. A few of my favorite dishes are: bacon wrapped dates, thai beef salad, filet mignon sliders, all of the skewers, and as an entree the rib eye which is served with their alloi is a must try! Their complimentary bread accompanied with an apple butter type spread and olives... mnn kepp them coming! Mango and Passion Fruit mojitos, oh how i LOVE you both :)
2	It is a good place for drinks and late night snacks but if you are looking for authenticity and food quality you will be let down.  It is fine if you don't really know food.
5	This is my favorite restaurant in vegas! The place is a little small & does get packed, but it is worth the wait! My favorites are the stuffed dates, filet mignon sliders & the stuffed peppers & the bread pudding for dessert.  I have never liked stuffed peppers anywhere until I tried them here, they are amazing! I have never been disappointed in the food & have eaten there many times! I highly suggest firefly & I am extremely picky, so for me to give a place 5 stars is very rare! & if you don't like the loud music & the tight space, then order to go! I've done this a few times as well & it's still amazing!
5	Bacon wrapped-dates and Camarones a la Diabla (Grilled Shrimp in a spicy sauce) were my favorites, but the Mac & Chesse and the Filet Mignon (I think?) Sliders were killer too.We had a hard time understanding the waitress (her accent was strong), but her smile lit-up a room, so we just asked her to choose some of the "house favorites" for us.  She was so nice and the food outstanding.  I also ordered the garlic fries, which were a little bit nushy this time, so we just dunked 'em in the spicy sauce from the grilled shrimp!
5	This is by far the Best Tapas I have had before.  It seemed like a local hang out and went with 2 of my brothers that lived there.  I liked the atmosphere and the price was pretty reasonable for the size of the portions.  I will be coming back for sure next time I am in town.
5	This was the best meal we had when we were in Vegas, hands down. First of all, even if it's 40 degrees out, they let you eat outside (with the big heating units of course). And you can smoke out there, which makes it even better (but not if you don't smoke).The portions here were huge, definitely bigger than most other tapas places. We went to four different tapas joints in Vegas and this one had the biggest by far.The "petite" filet is a must-try. It's not very petite at all, it's actually similar to the size you'd pay about $30 bucks for at Ruth's Chris. The short ribs were also finger-licking good.The dates wrapped in bacon were very good, though not my favorite. Ours were a little overcooked. Also, the mac & cheese was delish. We had the fries and the potatoes too, but I've got to tell you.. when you're eating tapas, you need to stick to one starch or you're gonna get full real fast!The place was totally packed and I was happy to be eating outside where it was much quieter than the hustle and bustle of the chaos inside.So yup, next to the all-you-can-eat tapas at the Hard Rock, this was my favorite place to eat in Vegas.
5	Ummmmm, can we talk about the banana-Nutella sandwiches?!?!... AMAZING! The best rendition of a comfort food-turned dessert I have ever had. It made a lasting impression since it was one of the last things we ate, but there wasn't one thing we ordered (out of about 13 items) that we didn't like. Larger portions, yet lower prices than you would expect from a tapas restaurant, and the food will take your taste buds on a culinary adventure they won't forget. Favorites: Baked tetilla, stuffed dates, empanadas, crispy duck rolls, and of course the banana-Nutella sandwichesFavorite condiment: spicy tarter sauce (comes with the fish sticks - FAR from your typical freezer section fish sticks). You do not want to miss this place if you go to Vegas!
5	Ah, Vegas.  Revisiting the past again.  I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.When my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.When we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.Soon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:Shrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).Stuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).French Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.Manchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.Terra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.Chicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.Lamb skewers - Very good and tender.Fried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.Camarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...With the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.Summary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant.
5	Great food and service..
5	I've had good food in the past months, but not grrrreat food!  I've been anxious to try this place since ever since.  I didn't care about doing anything else in Sin City this time around... I just had to try this place out!  They start you off with bread, butter, and some olives.  The butter was sweet and silky; if it could keep it's form for a few hours, I'd like some to go.  I'd be snacking on bread and butter all day long. We ordered the paella, stuffed dates, tuna tartare w/ taro chips, and lamb kabobs on top of lentils.  The tuna tartare was fresh and lightly seasoned, which went well with the clean and crisp flavors of the taro chips.  The dates were definitely a highlight.  No need to go into lengthy detail--they are as good... as great... as everyone describes them!  If I were to ever host an event or even someday get married, stuffed dates would be on the menu!   The lamb was tasty and the lentils were evenly cooked.  I had to take baby bites thinking that our paella was coming out.  However, we find out that our server didn't take that order down.  (Boo.. minus one star.)  He said it would take 10 minutes; so I impulsively told my bf to order another dish to fill the 10 minute void.  (We could've just eaten the kabobs, but like most Asians, we'd rather have our protein with rice.)  So, he ordered the steamed mussels.  I thought steamed would mean boring.  But boy, was I wrong.  Another solid dish!  The red broth or sauce the mussels were soaked in was freaking awesome!  (They can have their one star back.)  I couldn't quite pick out the flavors, but I did taste some ginger.  Sometimes ginger can be a bit overpowering, but this was nice and subtle.  And then our paella finally came.  The paella, which had a combo of clams, mussels, chicken and chorizo, was good, but by the time it came out, we were stuffed.  We=me+bf.  We caved in to gluttony, but felt no remorse.With Firefly's nice play on texture and awesome flavors, this was truly an unforgettable dining experience.  Firefly rocks!
5	Hands down, this is the best tapas place in Vegas...maybe even the best I've ever had!  This was our second time eating here and it never disappoints!  The food plates are small enough that you can sample a variety of things, and boy, do they have a variety!  Here's what we've ordered thus far:- Stuffed dates (bacon wrapped, 'nuff said!)- Manchego Mac n Cheese (can't get enough of this stuff!)- Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms (simply delish!)- Fried Calamari (can't go wrong with this)- Ahi Tuna Skewer (the ahi was seared just right and the mangos were an awesome addition)Even writing this review, I'm starting to crave the tapas and want more.  Unfortunately it's only in Vegas.  This is definitely a new staple for us and we'll be coming here for a long time!  It's also nice that it's off the strip so if you want some down time from all the glitz of Vegas, this is a great place to chill!
4	Came here for lunch, off the strip, not too many people. All the food was good, u can't go wrong, servers nice, drinks were good, mojitos and sangria good. Good solid 4.
3	I'm glad my friend and I tried this place out a couple of weeks ago.  We took a cab here from our hotel and surprisingly it wasn't that far from the Vegas Strip.  We ended waiting for about 20-30 minutes before we got seated and as soon as we were seated, we didn't hesitate to order.  Problem was, our waiter wasn't ready to order and was no where to be found!  After 15 minutes we finally flagged him down to take our order because we were HUNGRY!  The stuffed dates were delicious.  The beet salad, however should be called the pecan salad because we had about 4 tiny slices of beets and a whole lot of pecans (sigh).  The tuna tartare wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was definitely fresh.  The paella was large and flavorful, so I'd get that again the next time for sure.  The steamed mussels were so so and the filet burgers was alright, but probably only because I was too full from the other plates to really enjoy it (sigh).Although I only gave this place a 3 star, I'd come back again simply because it was a nice change away from food on the strip and the menu was surprisingly cheap. I love the vibe this place gives out, it was definitely a cool place to be and seemed like a fun hangout spot for the locals.  Hopefully the service is a bit better next time (I had to flag him down many times for basic needs).  I'm looking forward to my next Vegas trip so I can try the other tapas on the menu!
4	3.5 stars.We didn't get out of the airport until past 8:30pm, and no one wanted to be around for the appearance of HANGRY SUSASAURUS, so thank the lord we were seated within 2 min of entering Firefly.SERVICE: very good. They brought us delicious garlicky bread almost immediately upon seating us; our water glasses never went empty, and our plates were whisked away as soon as we were done. They even changed out our dirty plates for us.AMBIANCE: dimly lit, I can see how this is a favorite spot for pregaming before going out. It was loud and rowdy, but I had no problems with the noise level.FOOD: almost everything is tapas style. J and I shared:- Octopus: J liked it-- it was good except that the octopus' texture threw me off. It was slightly mushy, which made me think that it had recently undergone a poor freeze-thaw cycle.- Short ribs: yummy, but the sauce tasted EXACTLY like sweet and sour sauce from a place like Panda Express. It was amusing and completely unexpected.- Lamb sausages: pretty good. A tiny bit gamy, but I still gobbled it up.OVERALL: a fun place to snack a bit before an epic night of partying, or just chilling for the night.
5	I live in San Francisco, and San Francisco has good food...but nothing like Firefly!  The food is delicious, service is friendly, and the atmosphere is super fun!  Only downside is that it's a little dimly lit and can get a little loud.  I went on a Saturday night, so if you're looking to have a good conversation with your dinner-mates, go at a less crowded time or just try another place. They also have DELICIOUS sangrias - delicious enough to inspire me to make my own the next night.  Sadly, mine were not as good. Overall, if you're in vegas and want to get away from the strip, come here!
4	When I got to Vegas, I wanted to eat some Spanish food and I found this place through yelp. I love the atmosphere of this place. It was kind of a lounge feeling. Of course we ordered about four different things to share since we didn't really have a big appetite, but were just hungry. I loved the ceviche since it had a very lemony taste. We also had a glass of sangria which could have used more fruits in it. Their service was very quick and friendly. I believe this place gets really packed after 5 pm because there was a huge amount of people that started coming in. It was a friday night too.
5	I heart tapas and I heart Firefly. I don't go nearly as often as I feel I should. Can't get enough of this place. We had another get together here with some friends and had yet another fantastic evening. I love almost everything on the menu. The lamb skewers are always cooked perfectly. The dates are to die for. We ordered some other of our favorites; pitchers of blood orange mojitos, patron peppers, mac n cheese and some tortilla espanola. Yum, yum and more yum. Can't get enough of this place. Still need to try the location on Sahara, though.
5	If you're on The Strip being a tourist, do yourself a favor and splurge on a cab over to Firefly for dinner. You'll come out ahead money-wise and have a much better meal than you can find on Las Vegas Boulevard. It's a lively little tapas restaurant, dark and packed on a Saturday night, far too cool for its strip mall location. But then again, it's Vegas, and nearly everything's in a strip mall. We got a table for two after about a 20-minute wait and the service was great and glitchless from start to finish. Every last thing we ordered was interesting and amazing. Not a plate was left with a crumb. We had: a warm spinach salad with grilled peppers; a beet salad with goat cheese and candied pecans; fried red potatoes with homemade aioli; grilled diablo shrimp with a spicy, sweet sauce and garlic bread; calamari; and bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates.
4	based on single dinner at the bar. i was on a business trip and ended up here based on yelp recomendations from my yelp peeps back home. it was a tuesday night, but the place was still pretty busy. i ordered the chorizo clams, grlled octopus, fries, and a sangria. PLENTY of food for one.  the fries came out quick and the sangria was poured instantly. the octopus was excellent. the clams, well, had too much chorizo. or should i say, the chorizo didnt have enough clams. it was more of a chorizo dish than a clam dish. kind of overwhelming when expecting clams, but don't get me wrong, i'll order it again. overall bill was 30$ and i was stuffed. I ddnt finish the fries. id definitely go back, but would rather share the food with some company and get a chance to try more menu items...
5	My BFF is a local in Las Vegas and she brought my BF and I here to eat on one of our recent Vegas trips.... OMG! Why have I not ever been to a Tapas restaurant?? The prices are affordable and the food is delicious. You can order anything from calamari to shrimp ceviche to ahi tuna. You NEED to try the Bacon Wrapped Dates!!! TO DIE FOR!!! And if you know me... anything with bacon is good in my book! It's the best mixture of salty and sweet, trust me, I wasn't too sure about it at first, but it's well worth it! They even have a stuffed chorizo mushroom that was yuummie!! This is a place you MUST eat and does not compare to anything they have on the strip! And plus it takes a load of the wallet. :)
4	Amazing. Just, amazing.We arrived at the end of the lunchtime hours for a late lunch, and I sampled my friends' fries and for myself got an order of shrimp ceviche, and the brie grilled cheese with tomato soup. My friend imbibed on some sangria, but since I was driving home after our meal I skipped the concoction in favor of some coffee.The food was great. Our server was attentive, right up until the point he disappeared and we later saw him halfway out of uniform, hanging out with some other people at the bar. We had to finally ask another waitress to send over our server, who was indeed a new one. No one had said anything to us about a shift change, and my friends wanted to order more food and I really wanted some more coffee. I am shorting one star for having to flag someone down to get more food and drink refills, but otherwise it was a wonderful experience. The artwork on the walls made for some great atmosphere as well!
5	I love, love, love Firefly!  I love tapas!!  We used to frequent Cha Cha Cha back in SF so when we discovered Firefly a few years back, we knew we had to check them out!So here we are, 4 years later, and I still love Firefly each time we go.  It always seems like it's packed so reservations are your best bet.Alright, down to the chow:Sangria- both the red and white are good, depends if you are a white wine or red wine person.  The pitcher is well worth it cause you get almost 3 glasses per person ( based on two ppl)Bacon wrapped dates-love them! This took me awhile to get used to as I'm not a fan of sweet/savory but this combo really works.  And they really char the bacon, just how I like it, crunchy and salty on the outside and sweet and chewy on the inside...YUMCamarones Al Diabla- SO good!!!! The sauce is what makes this dish..it's slightly sweet, tangy, salty...SO good to dip your bread in, this dish is a MUST every time..Lamb chops- I love lamb so they couldn't go wrong with this, just don't overcook it and we are good.  It came out pink in the inside and had a nice char on the outside..perfecto..Overall- this is definitely my go to restaurant when I have visitors in town or special occasions...
4	Love this place, went here with a buddy from LA, decided to have a drink so we went to this well talked about place.  I had their Padron peppers and tuna tartare along with a bloody mary.  Great place for daytime drinks and appetizers :)  Expect to pay too much for small dishes of these delicious appetizers though...
4	very nice place. it has small little portions of different kinds of food with decent prices. so order at least 2 portion per person. the drinks are good too. they are not cheap and they make rich drinks. only reason i am not giving it a 5 is the location and the waiters/esses are not professional and a little dump
5	I am a fan of all things Sangria, and Firefly has to have some of the best around.  I love places with a great happy hour, atmosphere, and patio.  Firefly has all  three plus great tapas.  The service is always fantastic they are very attentive and friendly.  I can't think of a better place to start off a weekend in Vegas with your friends than this place.The must haves for me when I go is of course the Sangria (red) and the stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken.  The Calamari is quite good, and on my most recent visit the Shrimp a la Diabla was fantastic.  I look forward to my next visit to Firefly which will be very soon.
5	best sangria !!! Everything is super delish!!
4	Very good tapas and great selection of adult beverages. Be careful though, it's easy to spend a lot of money here by ordering a lot of tasty pitchers of sangria or mojoto's then followed up by the delicious assortment of tapas.
5	This is my spot! For me - small plates - freshly cooked - are perfect. The service is efficient and mostly friendly. But the food is the attraction at the end of the day. They are open late which suits my vampire hours very well indeed. I've now eaten here three times - and the stuffed mushroom w/ chicken and chorizo is my favorite. The fish sticks, and empanadas are also top notch. Wifey loved the ceviche of shrimp, & crispy duck rolls. ...The almond butter spread they offer free w/ bread is worth the trip alone! It IS loud - so know that going in. They get very busy on Friday & Saturday nights from 6-10 pm.
4	I found this place because I stay at the Fairfield Inn next door for work when I am in Vegas. The girl at the front desk said I should try out Firefly.I am soo glad she did. Their Happy Hour 3-6 pm, (but I cant remember if it is Mon-Thurs or Sun-Thurs call to double check!!) is great half off all drinks. Sangria is $6.5 a glass or $26 a pitch normally. They also have Mojito's in a variety of flavors, $7 a glass or $28 a pitcher. So during happy hour those prices are so great! You start out by getting a garlic bread, green olives and almond butter. Oh that almond butter is to DIE for!! But do not, I repeat DONOT eat all the bread just yet! You have to save some for the sauces the dishes come with, especially the Camarones a la Diabla! The service is amazing, it can get a bit crazy during the busy dinner times. But you'll never sit with a stack of dirty plates. You actually have to watch out for your plate of diabla sauce, you'll want to dip that bread that you saved!As for the dishes, I have tried SO many, here are my faves:Camarones a la Diabla- You get 7 shrimps in this amazing sweet, spicy chile garlic sauce.  (You can ask for more bread of you ate it all with your almond butter)Tierra y Mara- Skewers of shrimp, filet, and chorizo with a spicy green salsa. Stuffed Dates- Date with a smoked almond in the middle wrapped in BACON! Served with a red wine reduction.  People forget to add that they are ALMONDS in the middle.... I think that's what makes it great, other than the bacon of course! Another thing to use your bread for.'Padron Peppers- These are under the hot tapas menu, but they're a great appetizer too. These spicy little babies are either grilled or baked to give them a slight char to them. Served with lemon, and sooner than you know it you'll want to order another plate. Other things I have tried, Manchego mac n cheese, empanadas both the veggie and meat, baked tetilla, lamb skewers, firefly fish sticks, and too many more to remember.
5	The greatest food ever! All dishes are super tasty! I had the mussels in coconut sauce, chicken skewers, beef skewers, two order of the sliders, lamb, and a mango mojito! Delicious foods! Great service! This is the second time I have been here when in town. Highly recommend!
3	Sangria is so-so. Food is bland and not unique. Bay Area has way better places for tapas.
5	We really loved our dinner here... the only thing would be that we felt slightly rushed to eat and all of our tapas were brought out at once to our tiny table... it would've been truly perfect if we were able to eat more slowly without the fear of everything getting cold. I would order things spaced apart next time,AMAZING FOOD! To start with the almond type butter in the bread basket. They also agreed to some of my special requests... so. nice.Our favorite was the stuffed mushrooms & the stuffed peppers. TO DIE FOR. The tilapia was brilliant and the salads were HUGE. Red Sangria (which is a 4 day process) came in a large pitcher and did NOT disappoint!  We really wanted to try their house-made infused vodk, but they were out. This place definitely lives up to the hype. GO! And affordable!
5	I have a new favorite place in Vegas (that isn't a strip club or a dive bar)!Last week in Vegas we went to Firefly on a Monday night. I think it says something about this place that it was packed at 6pm on a Monday!I got there early and went to the bar while I waited for my party. It was happy hour at the bar with half priced mojitos and a free appetizer plate. I was sold right then and there. Then we sat down and ordered our food in earnest.First off all the stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon no less) is nothing short of awesome! But then again so was everything else. The Spanish meatballs, empandas, filet mignon sliders, mac and cheese, all of it was great!Seriously, this place as great drinks (the mojitos were awesome), a great atmosphere and amazing food. They definitely get packed, so make a reservation or be prepared to wait, even if you go on a Monday.I will not make another trip to Vegas without going here!
4	This a great place to meet up with some friends. I went here along with my other friends to celebrate the February Bdays. I read the reviews for this place and figured "why not" and give this place a shot. What did I have to lose? Some money and not coming back (that being the worst case scenario).The wait, I wasnt too thrilled with (had a party of 7). We waited for 45 mins. they were within their projected "wait for a table" time frame. We got thrown (not really) into the lounge area. Which was likely the most comfortable setting in the place (a lil loud, but the couches were comfy).I liked the variety of tapas..decent prices, great ambiance..I do have to say that a few people whom were waiting for a table were a "hot mess". Lets just say that those were messes, got the party started earlier and hoping to sober up? or perhaps not ? (im thinking not..lol) Technically, they were the entertainment for the night. Which is not guaranteed when you visit firefly.hahaI think what made the night was ordering 2 pitchers of Mojitos.
2	Yes,  two stars.I felt compelled to write this review for the fact that it was just a bad experience overall. I eat out, alot. I frequent new and old establishments.I eat mom and pop all the way to joel robuchon.I give everyone a fair chance, and probably me being in the industry is not going to help this review at all, however...Upon entering Firefly last night, there was no greeter for 4 minutes in a small lobby area that had no one present but myself and my girlfriend.When the hostess finally sat us, we waited 10 minutes before anyone remotely attended to us. When that person came, it was for bread on the table. Then....the wait, another 10 minutes and still no service,even for drinks.When my girlfriend spoke up, it was to another server who took our drink order AND our tapas selections. He told us, this was not his section, however..he put the order in and informed us that our "server" would be taking us through the remainder of our meal.We Thanked him and soon after, our plates arrived, rather quickly I might add.I must say, I am glad we only ordered 5 plates. Everything was either a fried element or had some sort of fried item in the food. At best, it was "ok". The Thai beef Salad tasted boring. No real essence of Thai at all. The beef almost tasted poached with no char,which could be from the over saturation of dressing. The dressing itself needed something to balance the acidity,perhaps a sweetness [which I am assuming was the purpose of the pickled ginger, is that even really "Thai"]And the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much.The empanada ..all I can say is Shame On You! Creme Cheese? Really?The duck rolls were constructed as if it were rillette , almost a puree.If, and I do stress, it was supposed to be that way, I would suggest learning to confit.The croquette seemed like fried potato soup with cheese. No real evidence of any ham whatsoever.About the only thing really "decent" was the tempura. Sauce was nice and not to overpowering with citrus segments in it. However, the green onions were left to soak in the grease for way to long and almost tasted burnt.All the while of eating, I noticed the heavier set man who I am assuming is the FOH manager roaming. He spent most of his time however at a table, picking up a child and speaking to one table and that table alone. Not realizing what his staff is doing.Now, back to the lack of service. Our waiter who "should" have been giving us service in the first place finally arrived at plate number 4.He saw that most of the plates were left un eaten and suggested that he "pack" the food up in a to go box. We declined. He never asked us how our meal was or even why there was an abundance of food left.You would think someone would get 2 + 2.It was also a little strange that when the "original" order taker asked if my girlfriend wanted a refill on her drink and the busboy delivered it, he prepared to take my beer away in replace,yet, my girlfriends glass was empty [ o , did I mention that I never received the option for a beer glass and just received a bottle], then..the bussboy brought another drink to the table after that. Two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered. At this point, I was at my limit.There are smaller points I could make, but I believe I am getting my point across. Firefly, this is my second visit. I wont be returning for a long long long time, if ever.
4	Friendly and patient staff. Very quick to deliver. We came with a big group and the service was great. All the plates were very flavourful. You've gotta try the bacon-wrapped dates! Great tasting and loaded drinks too. Love their 2 for 1 happy hour, the sangria is especially good. Well worth the drive off the strip and more interesting food and better prices than the hotel buffets.
5	Great place and atmosphere.  Went here for dinner with 5 other friends.  Perfect for sharing tapas and pitches of sangria!  There was not one bad thing we ordered!  Steak skewers, mushrooms, cerveche, artichokes, calamari, everything was soooo yummy!  Bathrooms arent the greatest.  The service was great and it was packed! LOVE IT!  I almost forgot the bacon covered dates! OMG to die for!
5	A secret place the locals dont want the tourists to know about.  I came here with some of my friends who live in Vegas. Yes its a small place inside a little strip mall but  the sangria is the BEST you can find in the desert. They also have an outside patio which is great for summer nights. They serve tapas which for those of you who don't know they are more like appetizers and not actual dinner plates. I recommend the steamed mussels. They are soo delicioso!! hmmm... But their Sangria is the best. Their staff is awesome and very friendly. If you are in the Vegas area check out Firefly. There are two locations. This one is on Paradise which is close to the strip. The other location is in old town Vegas down off of Fremont street.
5	I'm a fan of the shrimp ceviche, stuffed dates, duck rolls, ahi tuna skewers & the mojitos!
3	Today was the first day that I had been able to go back to Firefly in over 2 and a half years. It would have been five stars easily, if it was based off of my prior experiences, but not so much anymore. Three stars seems too low for a place that use that used to hold a special place in my heart and stomach, so four stars seems about right.The savory tapas are still delicious.The standout dishes are:Tortilla espanola- A potato omelet dish garnished with sriracha sauce and  parsley.Crispy duck rolls- Fried duck egg roll served with a hoisin dressing.Camarones a la diabla- A spicy and sweet shrimp dish. Get some extra bread and mop up the sauce.Shrimp ceviche-  Large chunks of shrimp, avocado, diced onions and bell pepper tossed in lime juice and served with tortilla strips.Stuffed dates- Dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon, fried crispy, garnished with goat cheese and parsley. If it was not 12:30pm... who am I kidding, if I wasn't driving, I would have been drinking. Remember kids, don't drink and drive. Make someone else be the DD. Their red and white sangrias are delicious. The best part of the drunken state comes from eating the fermented fruit floating around. After a few, it becomes a game to catch them all. Firefly's mojitos are amazing as well. My personal favorite are the mango or blood orange.  Even though it is a rum drink, that uses simple syrup, the fruit juices don't make it overbearingly sweet.The real disappointment lies in the desserts. I use to love this place for their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate tres leches cake, but the former was lacking immensely today. For one, there was hardly any banana in the sandwiches and they were cooked so dry that I needed to ladle the nutella onto it. Don't get me wrong, I would drink nutella, but I want to have the choice to go without it and that was taken away from me. The tres leches cake was delicious, but did it get smaller? Since coming back to Vegas, this has been the first time I looked at a dish and said, "WTF, where is my food?".I should have gone with my first instinct and gone to the Lunch Box for their waffle ice cream sandwich.
5	Traditional tapas aren't really my thing. I just determined that I'm not a huge fan of Spanish cuisine thus far (paella is good though...). That being said, I do like small dishes as a concept and Firefly executes this so well without coming off with an ounce of pretentiousness.This place is very laid back - visually, it has more in common with a nicer bar than a fine dining establishment. But don't let that fool you, the quality of the food here is top notch. Keep in mind though, it lies in a small strip mall with minimal parking, so brush up on your parking lot stalking skills or take a cab.Here, Firefly offers a wide variety of food in tapas form, but doesn't constrain itself to traditional tapas fare, which worked out perfectly for me. There's also French, American, Thai, and Chinese-inspired dishes here too. We had a decent-sized party, and we went to town here: bacon wrapped dates, french-style mushroom tarts, lamb skewers, filet mignon sliders, the list goes on. There is something for everyone here and everything they did, they did well.I will happily suggest and introduce this place to others next time I come back to Vegas.
3	Firefly is a good place to do happy hour.... They have some pretty sweet  HH specials, and the small plates lend themselves well to snacking.  They have lots of flavored mojitos, many of which I've tried (I generally find them a bit on the sweet side) and their famous sangria at a sizeable discount. The food, as far as vegan choices go, is pretty limited, but tasty enough.  There's gazpacho (my fave), patatas bravas (minus the aioli), some salads that can have the cheese left off, a lentil dish, and a large plate pasta.  You can fill up if you get three or four of these, but your socks will remain firmly on your feet.  The service varies - sometimes great, sometimes pretty bad, usually in between.  They serve food pretty late, so it's also a good option for late night snacking. For non-veggie people, apparently the bacon-wrapped dates are a little piece of heaven.
3	I wouldve given them 5 stars if the service was better.  I got there with friends early enough to miss the crowds that usually end up there right before dinner time (5-7pm) The hostess seated us facing the sun..so I really couldnt read my menu, or even see who exactly sat infront of me. I politely asked her if we could move to another booth or table and she said "umm NO"..SO I moved us to another table anyway and flagged down a waiter. UGH rude ass woman..ANYWHO..food was AWESOME! I loved the stuff dates and their fries. The sangria was amazing and fresh! We all had a good time catching up before leaving Vegas..I would DEF recommend this place if your looking for a nice chill spot early in the day..best times to go are btw 1-4pm...crowds WILL show up for the dinner rush  :)
4	These are not spanish tapas, but tapas style cuisine. It is meant to be shared with the table. It is a good way to be able to sample and try a lot of different foods and flavors. They got dishes influenced from a lot of different cuisines. Some dishes we had were: sliders, calamari, bacon wrapped dates, steamed mussels, lamb skewers, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. They have a nice variety and you can probably find a few that would interest you. Everything we had was good, but a bit heavy though. It could be just what we ordered. Sangria was good. Good meal and I would definately come back...if I have a car in Vegas.
4	Why is this place so hard to find?!?!?! We drove back and forth and must've passed it like 10 times! Don't know why...it's right there at the edge of the plaza. They need a bigger sign or something because we almost gave up! The food was tasty, but if I were to go back, I wouldn't order the same things. STUFFED DATES - these were my favorite. Very intensely sweet and salty. I wish there were more! MAC N CHEESE - I liked how the mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, however it was too salty. FILET MIGNON SLIDERS - the sliders were very yummy! I loved the cream sauce and the onion straws. There were leftover straws on the plate that I just wanted to eat up! I didn't think the "filet mignon" was all that special though...tasted like normal burger meat to me!FRIED CALAMARI - you can't go wrong with these, ever! RED WINE SANGRIA - This I did not enjoy. I wanted to see more fruit, I wanted it to be more refreshing. I definitely think this is a nice alternative to the typical Vegas buffets, all while getting the same great variety!
5	I was there for 3 days for some concerts and we stumbled on this place using yelp.  We got there around 1am and we waited in the bar area for about 10 minutes then we were promply seated.  Tapas were amazing Top picksAtmosphere is dark candel lit with a casuall hang out and drink place.1. sliders were seasoned and cooked perfectly.2.Both shrimp dishes were specatular3.Even the bread they give you at the start is awesome. 4. chicken cheese chorizo mushrooms were amazing as well.Get off the strip and come here for dinner or just to grab a drink.  You wont be dissapointed.
5	Firefly was awesome - everything was delicious!!!Here's what we had (we shared everything):The garden saladRoasted eggplant cannelloniAlbondigasEmpenadaChicken & chorizo stuffed peppersSteak & mushroom skewersFirefly fish sticksFried calamariPaella
5	Their sangria is sooo good!!  The dates are a must,so are the croquetas and empanadas!! Everything I had was ridiculously good. Price wise, not bad well worth it.
3	Not a fan.Food is just OKAtmosphere is just weirdWait sucksNot for me.
2	Sangria is good, but not the food.  I've been here twice, maybe three times and tried a variety of dishes.  The atmosphere was cool, but maybe I'm not a spanish cuisine person?  My date and friends love this place, so I think you either hate it or love it.
5	On separate occasions that I've gone, I have never EVER been disappointed and consistency is hard to come by nowadays. [AMBIANCE] your average I want to be chic but still chill and mellow[SERVICE] friendly, pleasant, nothing less..[FOOD] I cannot get enough of their menu, eclectic but not overbearing. With that said, these are my recommendation+ crispy duck rolls + paella (can never go wrong with that choice...not at firefly anyway)+ Steak and mushroom skewers (not the most amazing thing on the menu, but if you're a carnivore like myself, it's always a must)+ firefly fries - now this is not technically my recommendation but it was a good side, comparable to the truffle fries @ yardhouse[DRINKS] if you're in Vegas and you want to bring the wild someone out of someone without the mess I recommend a pitcher of this creeper![OVERALL]for someone who likes to get the most out of a buck, it's not bad. Be prepared its TAPAS style so don't expect hefty-size helpings, but a great place for big parties where you just want some good food, good conversation and again at vegas...it a change from the unusually LARGE meals and buffets
3	Best mojitos and tapas EVER! Moreso the mojitos.. just sayin. $28 bucks for a pitcher? Yes sir! Always busy, always... but the food and drink make up for it.
5	Wow.  Seriously great food, service, and overall experience. Husband & I ate at Firefly on St. Patrick's Day, Thursday 3/17.  We arrived around 11:30 p.m.; I thought it would be packed & kind of obnoxious, but it wasn't at all.  We sat on the patio, which had plenty of heat lamps, and were seated immediately. Everything was great.  The food was fabulous.  The only thing we had that I wouldn't recommend was the tomato/basil soup (tasted like something we could buy in bulk from Costco) but everything else was super tasty - baked tetilla, chorizo clams, empanada, terra y mar skewers, and the flan.  With 6 plates, we were stuffed...total bill was $42.  I like it!Service was great, with our drinks being filled often, and although we had two servers, it didn't cause any confusion.  I would  highly recommend Firefly for anyone visiting Vegas.  And, they're open until 2 a.m.!
4	Tapa DelightThe Gist:*A random strip mall with pretty intense restaurants that inhabit the place*Cute little lounge*I think the table an inch away is eavesdropping...*Pitchers of sangria- too bad I'm driving straight to Cali right after!*Small dish of olives & "croutons" came out to entice the palate *Ceviche & both kinds of empanadas were good*Servers were nice & cleared out plates efficiently My quick visit cost me about $23 for three small plates. I'll probably want to give this place another shot to taste the "must-haves" of the menu...but that depends on if anyone else is in the mood for some tapas.
4	Firefly was really happening! It's casual, but still has a lot to offer in terms of ambiance.  We had the gaspacho, artichoke toasts, fried calamari, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  All were excellent except for the mushrooms which were a little dry.  To top it off they make a good mojito.  Good food and a great price!!!
4	This restaurant was suggested by one of our masseuses at the Bellagio.It is a very popular restaurant as evidenced by the folks who were waiting when we arrived.  The weather was a little cool and rainy this particular evening.  They have an adjunct semi-open patio that was open, but a little cold for some.  My wife and i opted for the patio and  were seated immediately.  It was comfortable enough under a patio heater.  Nothing like a Ketel One on the rocks to help ward off the cold. Tip:  Instead of ordering a martini, just order on the rocks.  They charge .50 extra , but they bring the drink in a large cocktail glass.  The tapas menu was extensive and we sampled many dishes: shrimp, filet and chorizo skewers, stuffed dates with bacon,  warm spinach salad, baked tetilla ( tomato and cheese fondue) were some of them.  I did sample their sangria and it was fruity, but not overbearingly sweet.If you're looking for a casual restaurant off the Strip with great tapas, then Firefly should fill the bill.  The prices are very reasonable and a nice  respite from all the glitz on the boulevard.
5	I absolutely LOVE Firefly.  I come here pretty frequently, only because my friends from out-of-town have fallen in love with the restaurant just as much as I have and always need to get their fix whenever they come into Vegas.  This place can get pretty packed and wait times can be crazy around dinner time, but trust me.. if you've got the time, it's worth it!  I almost always get... - calamari- stuffed dates- mushroom tart- ceviche- mac & cheese- filet mignon sliders- steamed mussels- firefly fries- sparkling sangria The spread that's given with your breads is also heaven, mmmm.
3	barely a 3 if that... yelpers dunno what's up with all the high reviewstapas bar with bar tasting food. i used to live in spain so i love tapas. i expected so much from this place with all the great reviews.bread with tomato jamon serrano and machego cheese, the quality of the jamon here sucks, the bread was soggy by the time i actually got it because they at first forgot the ham and cheese, then they came back with just cheese, then had to go back for the jamon.. boojamon and machego cheese plate was a disappointment, the ham is poorly sliced  (too thick) and  like a said earlier low qualitytortilla espanola, dry without flavor, like they made it a long time ago and just had it sitting out, sauce was weirdpatata bravas were good, nothing noteworthy camarones al ajillo actually the best thing we orderedribs with mango sauce... my friends liked it but i didn'tfilet with mushrooms, not bad nothing specialhugely disappointed with this meal, i skipped dessert, left hungry with lots of food on the table. they kept bringing the food out really quickly that we ran out of space on our table, plates were hanging off the sides of the table. you would think that either #1 the waiter would tell us we ordered too much or #2 they would bring things out a a slower pace than 3 plates at a time.
4	Preface: On Friday & Saturday nights - naturally the busiest nights - they do NOT accept reservations for small parties.  Expect about an hour wait, but the cocktail bar makes it go by quickly.The entire experience with Firefly was pretty good.  It was jam packed on a Saturday night when we showed at 7:30, and we did wait about an hour for our small two-top in the back corner.  The restaurant is pretty small and it was full of larger parties - more than one bachelorette party, or so I'm assuming by the amount of pink boas and other paraphanaelia I noticed.I enjoyed almost everything we had.  Started with a pitcher of red sangria and it was amazing.  A little sweet though; by the end of the pitcher we couldn't even finish our last glasses.  Then again, both the bf & I are dry martini drinkers, so don't let my experience sway you from trying it.We had the tuna tartar - awesome, shrimp ceviche - awesome, surf & turf skewers - awesome, & mac n cheese - passable.  I live for mac n cheese, and I could have lived without this one.  It was extremely sharp in flavor, and that's just not my style.The only thing I didn't try that I really wanted was the cherry chocolate bread pudding, which I hear is great.  Next time.Five stars for the atmosphere, cocktails & service.  Four stars for the packed in tables (I couldn't get out of my seat without bumping the table next to us...and I'm not a big person) and food.  Next time I'd like to try the patio seats and maybe on a weekday when it isn't so crazy packed.
5	Yummmmmmmmm!Best little Tapas joint in Vegas !! If it's busy, it's worth the wait.  Red Sangria is very nice with lots of apple in it.  This is always my  favorite location
5	Great food at extremely reasonable prices!  A must stop for me when I'm in Vegas.
4	thanks jujuan for taking us here for our first night in Vegas. the food was awesome, the service was on point, and we had 6 small plates and 2 cocktails for $60. we were stuffed and couldn't even finish everything. the shrimp ceviche was fresh and yummy. best part, all locals there
5	I love EVERYTHING I ordered here. Which is almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the lentil salad. I try to come here as often as I can.The desserts are delicious. Especially the chocolate leche cake. It's sooo good!  Milky & not to sweet . I always get the pitcher mojito's or pitcher sangria. Service is always on point even if you come w/ big groups. They are always on top of everything. The restaurant is always clean & I like the red decor. Best tapas in vegas!
5	This is now the 3rd time I've come to Firefly. It's become a ritual where every time I'm in vegas we eat at Firefly for one of the nights. The food is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced.Definitely get the Tiera y Mar skewers, the patatas bravas, and the banana nutella sandwiches. The thai beef salad is also really good!
5	We gave this place a try after reading a few reviews on Yelp. The place was packed mid week!  We go seated in about 20 minutes which seemed fair for a full restaurant. Our the service was quick and helpful with the menu selections. The almond stuffed dates are awesome! The sangria was pretty good too!  A definite must when we come back to Vegas.
4	I had the privilege to go here for a girlfriend's 30th birthday party. There were just 6 of us and we were seated right away at a table near the door (which was perfect so we could see our friends arrive). We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was absolutely perfect. It goes down WAY too easy.We ordered dishes bit by bit. The highlights were:Bacon wrapped dates - a must have whenever you come hereLox on toasted brioche, creme fraiche, tomatoes, capers with a dill vinaigrette - So light and an excellent new findTomato basil bisque- I HATE tomato soup usually...until I tried this...served with a grilled cheese sandwich.Calamari - will a garlic lemon aioli...not good for you but so dang tastyThe only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ahi tuna skewers. They weren't awful but they just didn't do it for me. Too much pineapple and mango and not enough tuna. Gotta take the good with the bad.Our server was pretty attentive until the end. It was close to midnight and we wanted a round of shots to cheers the end of my friend's 20's. By the time he came back...there was 3 minutes left. We didn't get them until 5 minutes after so we were a bit bummed but still bid her last decade farewell.Overall it was a great night and we had a blast...will be back soon :)
4	Was a solid place to get some great food and drinks. Went in expecting to grab a snack before dinner, walked out with a $80 bill for 2 after devouring 14 plates of food, 3 drinks and desert. Left with full stomach, and couldn't have been happier! Food was good, tasty, but not over the top or extremely exciting. There is so many things to choose from it makes it hard to hold back. A local spot that deserves to be visited in Vegas. You'll be missing out if you don't go!
4	Oh my goodness , do I ever love this place.  Tapas is my absolute favorite, and this place is heavenly.  It's a few blocks off the strip (cab it people, don't walk), and it's happily not as Vegas-y and glitter-y as other Vegas establishments.  We had a variety of tapas plates, but the mac and cheese was my favorite.  The white sangria was also delicious with lots of fresh fruit.  You won't be disappointed!
4	Nice little place. Great atmosphere; average service; pretty people. Get the Ahi Poke if you like fish!
5	This was my first time having tapas and I am definitely coming here again the next time I'm in vegas! Not too pricey either. It's good to go with some friends and order a bunch of plates to share! The shrimp and filet mignon skewers were to succulent, flavorful, and very well cooked.. I'm salivating as I yelp! Check this place out for sure!
3	I just got back from an experience at Firefly meeting with a friend to have dinner. I wanted to get this review in quick before I forgot about all the little nuances and why it is getting a 3-star rating , instead of the 4 or 5 it should have gotten.First, I want to point out that I am a huge fan of Firefly. It is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas and honestly if I'm going to have tapas I am going to go to Firefly. Personally my favorite Firefly was the one in The Plaza downtown, but since I cannot review that one since it is now closed *sad face*, I will be satisfied with the location on Paradise.First off, this location's parking situation has always irritated me. And  often when they do valet I just can't believe it. It's a ridiculous situation. But that is the least of my complaints for tonight. First let me begin with the service - it was "okay". The food came out quickly, none of our meals were forgotten, but when it came to delivering our check, the waiter dropped the ball - BIG TIME. He came and asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, he asked if we wanted more drinks, we said no. This is a clear indication that we wanted OUR CHECK. Our check never came. We sat for a little over 30 minutes and we were forced to wave down a girl, who was not even our server so we could get our check. *sigh*This was a bad experience, I must admit, because all of my other experiences at Firefly have been superb! Both at the Paradise AND Downtown location.What about the food? Well, I strayed from my favorites this time ( I LOVE the shrimp ceviche, it is SO delicious). This time I had the artichoke toasts. These were good and the aioli on them made them delectable! However, I also had the empanada (probably the worst empanada I've ever had in my entire life). And the mushroom tart. Here's what I have to say about the mushroom tart: it's too big for a tapa, unless you're sharing, it's too rich for a tapa, and I really wish I had known that.On this occasion I did not have sangria, but I do highly recommend it based on my previous experiences, especially if you are in a large group - spring for the pitchers! Lastly - the banana Nutella dessert IS absolutely delicious and although I did not have it on this visit I highly recommend it. I will absolutely go back to Firefly, but I think I'm going to stick to my favorites from now on: ceviche, the fries, and the artichoke toasts. I really wish I could have given a better review, but just based off the tapas I ordered and the poor service, only a 3-star rating it shall be until I make a return trip.
4	My wife and I visited Firefly during a recent trip to CES.  Locals and our LA friends recommended this place to us.  The food is pretty tasty.  In fact I was impressed.  I recall our waiter being super friendly.
5	Easy cab ride from The Strip. Excellent sangria - get a pitcher! There was a table limit of 1.5 hours when we were there - not sure if that's always the case. Quick service. Charming place, good menu variety, worth the cab fare. Enjoy!
1	My partner is suffering from food poisoning right now as I write this review - thanks alot firefly.  We assume it's from the chicken skewers or an apple salad - these are the only things I didn't try of his, Thank God.  We ate around 8pm on 4/25/11, he was throwing up by 11:30pm.  It's 2:21am now and he's still praying to the porcelain god.  This is horrible and obviously we will never come back - I feel disgusted and almost want to ask you for a fucking refund.  We weren't expecting a side of salmonella or e Coli with dinner tonight.  Also, thanks for ruining what was a great vacation thus far.
4	Off the Strip with a solid tapas selection and offering giant pitchers of your choice sangria or mojito, Firefly was a great reprieve from the extravagance of Las Vegas' strip. The food wasn't necessarily phenomenal but all of the dishes were good. And the prices were very reasonable (rare considering its locale...).They had all of the basics - stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, patatas bravas draped in what tasted like a chipotle mayo sauce, Serrano ham and cheese croquetas (quite rich), stuffed picadillo peppers with goat cheese - and they all tasted the way they should. If you're in Vegas and are looking for a quick escape back to normalcy, head here to load up on some well-priced pitchers along with a satisfying sampling of small plates.
4	This is one of my favorite places to go to!  It's a great place, so it's always crowded, even with reservations, you'll have to wait a little.All the dishes are great, the waiters and bartenders are very customer oriented, but the hostesses are OK. They forget they are the first ones customers see when we walk in and they have to finish their conversations before accommodating us. Hence the 4 stars. This place is perfect for dates, intimate ones, and also groups- girls' night, birthdays, etc; any kind of celebration; The vibe makes you really happy yet relaxed; but never sleepy =)They need to open up a few more!!!
5	This place is Awesome! On top of having the best looking date in the entire restaurant, the food was remarkable! It was her idea to come here, and I have to say, it was worth every penny! The downfall was the wait however, i think that has a lot to do with the fact that i was starving...everything seems long when your hungry or in a hurry. Overall a great experience. Open late, nice relaxed atmosphere, unbeatable prices and unparalleled taste! Filet Mignon for like 12 bucks ! go figure! Anytime I visit vegas you will find me here at some point! Keep up the great work and hey whenever you want to open a Firefly in Los Angeles, or Los angeles area, Contact me for the grand opening! I will be there with bells on! lol May be interested in investing in it! lol Buy some stock, hell i'll sleep there and wake up too it! lol Hope this helps someone definitely go here!
4	I was visited Firefly last weekend on Friday night and I have to say bacon wrapped dates!  That was the best part of dinner.  The ambience was trendy and the service was quick and polite.  Besides the bacon wrapped dates, which were amazing we had the filet mignon sliders, which were good but I don't think filet mignon should be served in a burger.  It takes away from what it is.  We also had the patats bravas and skewers which were good as well.  I tried the sangria, which was good but a little too sweet and light on the alcohol for my taste.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because while we were waiting to be seated outside because it was so crowded all the smokers were lightiing up right outside the door and it was super gross coming from a nonsmoker.  They should designate a smoking area.  Also, we were seated outside where there are no smoking signs posted everywhere yet we saw some girls smoking on one side and none of the staff people said anything.
5	This Firefly location has to be our ultimate favorite.  It's unassuming, intimate and the service is pretty good, not to mention, the food is quite spectacular!First off, it was a great sign when they serve us the bread and we were noshing on it as if we've never eaten bread before.  We can attribute it's deliciousness to the spread it came with.  I wouldn't say it was butter as it had a cheesy consistency and had a strong hint of almonds.  Whatever it was, it's was crack and I'm hooked!The s/o fell in love with their Bacon Wrapped Dates.  In fact, love is an understatement as the s/o ordered two plates of it.  I'm not a fan of dates but I'll admit, it was a blast for my palette.We also ordered the Filet Mignon sliders which were awesome,  you can't help but love the fried onions in them!  In addition, the Ceviche was delicious as well as the Empanadas.  I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms which were just okay.  The filling was a bit dry, it could've used a little sauce or at least a lemon wedge to squeeze over it.  Lastly, the Mac and Cheese were like wow, it's not your Mac & Cheese in a box, that's for sure!Overall, Firefly has become one of our fave restos off the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  It'll definitely be a spot we'll hit every time we're in Vegas!
5	I had originally booked the downtown location for my wedding reception.  They had promised the entire dome room all to ourselves.  10 days before the wedding, and only after I called them THEY CANCELED!!  They had me relocate to the paradise location and sharing the room with all of the other patrons including a party of cross dressers that looked like they would have been more comfortable in football uniforms.  At this point you are probably wondering how and why I gave them 5 stars.  The food!  Oh my Lord the food was amazing!  Most of our guests had never had a tapas meal and were concerned when the first tapas of bacon wrapped dates came out.  This was the best thing I have tasted in quite some time!  We had 5 additional tapas following.  We had the ham & cheese croquettes, the spicy shrimp, chicken skewers, steak & mushroom skewers and mango ribs.  I did not even have any ribs and I was stuffed to the gills.  Everything was so delicious it was easy to ignore the fact it wasn't our ideal setting.  The drinks flowed like water.  It was an amazing night we will never forget.
5	OMG!  So, my girls and I went last weekend and couldn't stop eating!  Seriously, I think between the 4 of us we ate almost everything on the menu.  I love the local vibe because sometimes, the strip can feel a bit contrived.  Best item on the menu is the bacon wrapped fig.  AWESOME!
5	Firefly on Paradise.  We'd been to the Plaza location and LOVED the food.  Arrived about 8:00 pm, got seated immediately.  HOLY COW, is that place crowded and noisy, a little too much for hubby, after about 15 minutes he was ready to bail, but held in there.  It's also kinda dark.  I do hope the Plaza location opens again, much nicer atmosphere.  We had a great server.  There were three of us for dinner.  The food is outstanding, together we ordered:Bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates - 5 starsChicken salad - 5 starsVeggie Empanada - 4 starsChorizo & Chicken stuffed mushrooms - 5 starsFilet Mignon sliders - disappointing, dry, 2 starsLamb Skewers - 5 starsSteak & Mushroom Skewers - 5 starsAhi Tuna Skewer - 4 stars$75.00 totalWAY too much food, but took a doggie bag back to the room, had a cooler with ice and ziplock bags!
1	I swear to god, I tried almost every. single. dish. And I honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best. The best part of the meal was the paella, but the seafood here just isn't very fresh - you know when shrimp gets mushy/rubbery when frozen? And I can't believe I dropped so much for those "filet mignon" burgers which were so overrated! I would recommend against the sangria as well which was wayyy too sweet. The people were really nice, and it's good for groups, but it's really just not very good food.Sorry Firefly!
4	Firefly has excellent food when you know what order. Stay away from entree because the tapas are usually delicious. Also the mojito pitchers are delicious. Last time I went it was pomogrante flavor, so good we ordered two. The service is okay but their always super busy.
3	It's F*ing dark in here. Sorry, not a fan of dim lighted areas, service sucked, didnt get my food till about 30 mins of sitting down and do not come here for dinner. Portions are small and probably a place just to kick it at
2	Small plates, yes. Tapas, no.OK, so it's the Vegas strip, which makes me apply my sliding scale and give this place 2 stars (in NYC it would get one, or if Yelp allowed it, zero).It's crowded, dark, and festive. OK - so far I'm thinking we're starting off right. Then we get the drinks. Way watered down. And expensive. Then came the food. If anyone who does food prep in this restaurant has ever been to Spain, I'd be surprised.I'm all for innovation, but only when the results are worth it. The better tapas were completely forgettable, the rest were actually bad. Seriously. Have the people who give this place a good review ever eaten good food? Or were they too drunk off the (weak) crappy drinks to notice?
5	WOW! This place off the strip really nails it! Fantastically priced and portioned. The signature mojitos and sangria go down very easy. Open late and serves food late!
4	Sangria is the best in Las Vegas and you can't beat it at $3 a glass at happy hour.  Food is good not great.  Best happy hour in Vegas in my opinion.  They even bring you out a free appetizer.
5	This tourist couple discovered Firefly watching the Travel channel about 10 years ago and have been coming here on every visit to Las Vegas every since.   The mojitos are excellent!  Love how the menu is structured around small plates that are around $5 each so you can try lots of different items and order more as you need to.  This particlarly good if you have a group of about 4 and are willing to share.  You might call it tapas inspired because it isn't Spanish food - just small plates of many different kinds of food.Over the years it seems to have turned from a quiet, low key place to a much louder, trendy place but we still love it.  Lots of vegetarian options!  The roasted eggplant canneloni, and stuffed peppers are especially good.
4	My sister and I went here to experience something in Vegas with a bit of local flare and we were not disappointed! I too agree that the dates are a must have as well as the sangria! Go here if you want some great food, a good atmosphere and affordable prices!
2	For a spot that boasts good food n hip atmosphere their closing hours are a downer. Who closes at midnight in Vegas. Come on man
5	We are in Las Vegas at least 10 times a year and always have dinner at the Firefly.  We have never been disappointed with either food or service.  The best value around for food quality--and the sangria is some of the best around.  The firefly fries are always a hit when we bring people here.  The menu is so varied that it is perfect for any palate.
5	It was such a delight living right down the street from Fire Fly's... We could even walk home since it was so close to where we were living at the time.  My favorite thing about this amazing place is its Mojitos!!! Amazing!! I never liked mojitos til I ordered them here!! (and yes them about 4 or 5) lol My favorite tapa is the mushroom tart and mac'n cheese as well as the steak and mushroom skewers.  Oh and wait if you like tres leches cake you must try the chocolate tres leches!!! it is soooo decadent and such a treat!!! I have even tried to dupicate it and it just doesn't come out the same!! Love this place!
5	It was a busy Saturday night.  We waited about half an hour to get seated, which was fine.  The food was good, but the SERVICE, was what makes it a true 5-star experience.  The mussels & and the flan were probably my favorite.. the octopus was a bit over cooked but still tasted alright.  I highly recommend this place!!
5	This place is incredible!  bacon wrapped dates, filet sliders, mac cheese, thai beef salad, empanadas, tuna tar tar!  be sure to always order a pitcher of sangria (i like to get one red and one every time!)  Can get crowded during rush hours!
5	I love love love this place!!!  My fiance & I like to visit Firefly when we visit LV, which is pretty often.  I love the tapas thing they got goin' on.  The sangria is delicious and my very favorite thing on the menu is the stuffed dates yum yum yum!  I've been to their other location, but the one in downtown definitely has a better ambience and view.  The location is great as it sits at the end of the downtown arcade thing.  The only dumb thing about this place is how early it closes.  I think we went around 12am one time & it was already closing.  What restaurant closes at 12am in LV?!  boooo...lame
5	Oh so yummy!
4	My friend who is an ex-resident of Vegas recommended that I stop by Firefly and try their delicious tapas. The selection of tapas makes decision making for the indecisive quite difficult. Though, almost instinctively, the bacon wrapped stuffed dates caught my eye...like I have bacon radar or something. And yes, they are as yummy as my fellow yelpers have indicated. The best part, aside from the obviously delicious little crispy ruffled pork jacket gently caressing the date, was the surprise bit of almond thoughtfully placed inside date adding in the perfect crunch, texture, and flavor. We also tried the mac n cheese, which was quite rich and filling; the filet sliders, perfectly cooks little burgers with cheese and fried onions; the veggies and lentils, which were surprisingly flavorful, and the best of all, the crispy duck rolls. The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were so crispy and tender, I wanted to order two more helpings. All in all, we ordered five plates and felt pretty full afterwards. And, the bill was really reasonable. It was pretty refreshing to dine off the strip, eat a really delicious meal, and not feel like your wallet just got hijacked. We will definitely be back on our next visit.
5	My family and I had a leisurely lunch here.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  All of the tapas were excellent, especially the bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartar, empandas and smoked salmon.  The service was excellent as well.  I wholehearedly recommend this restaurant.  We can't wait to go back.
4	I wish I didn't have to drive to this place from the Mandalay Bay so I could have had more sangria!Arrived in Vegas around 8pm.  Drove over to Firefly where there was only a 10 minute wait for the two of us.  It was a Friday night and it was busy so I was surprised the wait was so short.  Our hostess, server, and bussers were all very nice.  The sangria was so good and pretty strong.  We ordered a handful of tapas as well. Mushroom tart - AMAZING.  Veggie Empanada - Not as good as I hoped it would be.  I wish I had skipped that and ordered another mushroom tart.Mac 'n' cheese  - Definitely some of the best mac 'n' cheese I've ever had!Fries - Good but the aioli tasted like nothing :(I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, but I'll be sure to either take a taxi or not be the DD!
5	First time dining here on 05/20/10.  The experience here was wonderful.  We tried ...-Stuffed dates-Chorizo clams (the best)-Filet mignon sliders-Albondigas (meatballs)-Red Sangria-Tres Leche cakeAll the items were great, I highly recommend the Chorizo clams if you enjoy clams... I will definately be back for more!
4	yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too.
4	Great lively atmosphere, good drinks, cool hangout spot for small groups. Too bad Latin Night (Salsa dancing) wasn't profitable enough for the place, so it got shut down, but next time I'm in LV, I'll def come back.
5	Amazing! I am gluten free and have not had stuffed peppers since I started on the diet. There gluten free menu was very extensive and delicious! I ordered three different plates because I couldn't decide. I ate every bite! Awesome pricing...no complaints
4	Went with a group of friends and had a wide selection of dishes. Very good with the octopus and lamb chops my favorites. Service was first rate.
5	the MF"N best tapas...I live in SD and I always stop in for dinner here when I am in town.
5	Ate three meals during our 2 nights' stay, and two of those were at this place!! Had we stayed longer, we could have eaten there everyday for another 2 months at least.. lol..Everything we tasted were great, but by far my favorite is the lentils.
4	My first impression was, "A hidden find off the strip."You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside all the goods this little restaurant has to offer on the inside. They have a cute little patio where you enter, and inside the ambiance is cool, mellow, and has a lounge/bar area. Little did we realize we were ordering plate after plate of Spanish tapas. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were typical of tapas entrees. We tried several, however, one thing that I crave and would definitely go back for were their stuffed dates. They were absolutely amazing. These little dates are wrapped in bacon, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese, and all grilled under red wine. Sounds irresistible right? You'll see why yelpers rage about these little delectable bites. If you're planning on trying something off the tourist list while visiting Las Vegas, this is one you must try!The lasting impression? "Great place for small bites with a side of wine or a series of mini plates for a creative meal."
4	Headed to Firefly for a late lunch. Per yelpers rave reviews, tried the dates wrapped with crispy bacon and had a surprise almond inside. This was a really good combination. Stuffed red peppers: Very good, stuffed with creamy goat cheese and covered in red sauce.Calamari sautteed - can't remember what this was called but the calamari had chopped tomatoes. I didn't really like this as the calamari was very soft and mouchy. A little weird to me.duck rolls - big rolls deep fried with lots of shredded duck meat and hoisin sauce. Good stuff. I think if it had a little less meat and some other element like green onions. Kinda like how chinese eat peking duck that would be better.Also tried to be healthy by getting a Big Bowl of Salad. Refreshing, light and healthy.The staff was attentive, they also brought some yummy garlic bread, and the food came out super fast. The red sangria was also fabulous!
5	I had my wedding reception here that hosted about 70 people. The planning process with their event coordinator, Valeria was very professional and very accomodating. I was able to bring in my own decorations. They set everything up for us and it was amazing! Now lets talk about the food. We did the Meal #2 plan I believe, which consisted of 5 tapas: bacon wrapped dates, albondigas, artichoke toasts, and the other 2 I can't remember because I was busy with everything.. They were all amazing! I wish I was able to eat more and enjoy it! We had a salad included in our meal. For the main course, we had steak freitas... AMAZING! and some type of rotissorie chicken. We had seafood paella with the main course and it was one of the best  We also had chocolate cake and flan that was served as the dessert. Oh, and the bar was very convienent as well since it was just for our guests.Overall, the restaurant staff was great. They were all very welcoming and catered to every need. We had our own private banquet room that fit everyone perfectly. The only downside was it was a bit hot in there. I do plan to eat there the next time I am in Vegas. If I were driving by I probably would have not stopped to eat, but I did find the reviews on yelp very helpful in selecting this location for my wedding reception!
5	Had an amazing time here yesterday with about 6 of my "mommy" friends. We drank..we ate..we drank some more. This place is perfect for a big group like ours was. We chilled out on the U shaped sofas. Our server was great & took excellent care of us. I drank my usual watermelon mojitos. They were perfect. And I ate the stuffed dates & shrimp ceviche. They were both perfect as well. I cant wait to come back here again!
5	yummy tapas? good.pitcher of sangria? good. whats not to like about firefly???what i ate:- mushroom tart: puff pastry filled with a delicious concoction of various mushrooms on a bed of creamy cheese. you wont miss the meat in this one, the mushrooms are so earthy.- bacon wrapped stuffed dates: i LOVE these things. its such a simple tapas, but so tasty. the sweet date pulled the sweetness out of the bacon but the saltiness was still there. the cheese inside balanced everything out with some creaminess, and the nut gave it just the right bite of texture. i could pop these things all night- steak and mushroom skewers: i wasnt expecting much, i mean this isnt a steak place (ruths chris is right next door). but omg, the steak was perfect! it was tender and perfectly cooked. the mushrooms were a nice balance. i dont know that the sauce was on the plate, but i sopped up the rest with some bread- empanda: this was also tasty. the meat filling had a nice spice to it, and i loved that it came with a bit of salad on the side. the salad was vinegary, crunchy and fresh. a nice palette cleanser- sausage plate: i dont know all the different meats that came, but there were four different kinds. came sprinkled with capers and gherkins. - firefly fries: you know why these were good? because you know firefly peeled the potatoes and made them on site, FRESH. because these tasted like in n out fries... but BETTER (i know i know, you didnt think it was possible, but these were actually better)- sangria: light, fresh, fruity but there was still a nice wine flavor to it- bread: yea, i know who cares about bread when you have yummy food to eat? but honestly, i get turned off by places that dont take details into account. i wasnt worried about the food when i had the bread at firefly. the baguette was good, but the butter that also came out with it was amazing! kept eating it with the rest of our small platespros:- FOOD: i cant rave enough about everything i ate!!! my mouth is seriously watering about all the food we ate. i know its a tapas place, but the portions were generous!!!! i left feeling stuffed! and we didnt even finish everything- price: 6 tapas plates and a pitcher of sangria for about $70. cheap considering everything we ate! - service: server was attentive and always filled our glasses when he saw that they were empty. the busboy was also adorably eager to whisk away our plates. - ambiance: definitely a great place to take a date! the patio was nice and cozy with dim lighting. inside was nice too, though CROWDED when i went.cons:- the WAIT. they dont take rez on the weekends i think. *TIP* try calling ahead and asking to be put on the list. the hostess will politely say, ok, but this does not put you on the actual waiting list and it does not guarantee you a table upon arrival - basically just talk to cover her ass just in case. we did this before we left and got seated right when we got there. awesome! - bathroom: i know its a busy restaurant, but my god, this was a bad hollywood club bathroom! paper towels all over the floor, and a line of bitchy girls that stared every girl down as they entered. *shudder* would i come again? YES
4	Great food and atmosphere. The dates and mac and cheese are wonderful. Ate there twice while on vacation !
4	What hasn't already been said about Firefly? It's one of the best restaurants in town.  Since everyone knows, I'll keep it short.Beautiful interior, service is superb, food is mind-blowing, diverse menu, awesome location.The only drawback is how busy this place can get! That's why make a reservation if you ever decide to go!PRO: Food, Decoration, Service are all great!CON: Can get a bit busy and noisy during peak hours
5	Soooooo delish!  It's off the strip (we stayed at the Flamingo, and it was a short walk - maybe a mile), but worth it.  It's all tapas, decently priced, and a friendly, young staff.  You can also check in early so you have a table waiting.
5	best taps in the U.S
5	Great restaurant that we go to every time we're in town.  It's just off the strip, and it's a nice way to get away from the long lines and tourists.  They offer both indoor and outdoor seating.  All the tapas are great - some of our favorites are the thai beef salad and the tuna tartare.  Both are very refreshing and a good combination of ingredients.  And of course, their sangria goes with all of their dishes!
4	Fun and sheik!Happy Hour was perfect for that hot day in Vegas - pitchers of sangria & mojito couldn't have hit the spot any better!  Loved the dark red ambiance and lounge furniture.
5	My first impression was, "I'd be back in Vegas just for their bacon wrapped dates with toasted almonds and blue cheese."Here's a second review of Firefly after being there just a week ago and trying some more tapas plates with my friends. We first ordered a pitcher of red Sangria for the table since it was happy hour (1/2 price on all drinks) and of course, what goes better with Spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine? Our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just $14.00. It came in a pretty tall pitcher, well chilled, and with chopped apples inside for presentation.-Chorizo Clams (peppers, 2 kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts) the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious.-Steamed Mussles (red curry, white wine and coconut cream) the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish. It was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles!-Stuffed Dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) must try must try must try. Too out of this world.-Stuffed Peppers (Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce) The combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish, but the sauce wasn't too impressive. I'd say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates. But good if you love your tomatoes and cheese, pasta sauce taste.-Mushroom Tart (puff pastry, boursin cheese) Simply good.The lasting impression? "Check out the photos, you'll be sold. It's a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little Spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends. It's a nice breather off the Strip in LV."
4	Great night spot if you don't mind waiting for a table or standing at the bar.  The tap pas are great although they don't update the menu very often which is a bummer.  My go to dishes are the stuffed dates and Mac & Cheese.  You really cant go wrong with anything on the menu.
4	Fan of Firefly! I love the stuffed dates, mac and cheese, firefly fries, and kobe sliders. I could live off those 4 items at firefly, but it's always fun to try new things because the prices are good and portions are small, so if you don't like it it won't turn into a ruined meal and also won't break the bank. We came on a week night around 730 and the place was still really busy, the nba finals was on in the bar and the place was a little rowdy, but that's fine. I like festive places!The place is always consistent with it's food offerings, but it does seem to me that portions are getting a tiny bit smaller, the firefly fries used to come in a huge bowl, and this time it wasn't near as big. The mac and cheese used to seem bigger, but maybe that's just me, it was barely enough for two of us to share.The bill here is always much lower than we expect, and that's including a few drinks, and always seems to surprise us! Firefly will continue to be a fun place to go when company is in town, my mother loves this place!4 solid stars
5	Read all the reviews and they did not fail me! Love everything that i had here from the stuffed dates ( which are to DIE FOR) to the mac and cheese. Probably had 6 different types of tapas and all of them are very good and mouthwatering! The sangria is good but i prefer the mojito better. They pack it up with a lot of lime that's not too overpowering. The food was excellent (whatever tapas you order, but i definitely love the stuffed dates, tuna tartare and filet mignon sliders -they melt in your mouth... And you're left with the bread) service was good and atmosphere is great. This will definitely be one of my main stops when i visit vegas!!!! Plus it's happy hour!!! So all drinks are half off!!!! Even better!
5	every thing was awesome!  all the dishes were very flavorful! the mango mojito was very good, i think i could drink a whole  pitcher by myself!
4	Great Vegas stop for locals AND out-of-towners!!! My bf and I decided to stop by here during our latest visit.  Here's the deal:- tapas style restaurant..ie small plates- price ranged from $4-10- sit @ the bar for the free sampler [includes 3 items--meatball, an egg/fritata thing, and bacon wrapped date]- get a pitcher of sangria...totally worth it if you are up for a paaaartaay!- bacon wrapped dates are the bomb.com- all the skewers were delish- less than 5 minutes from the striphighly recommended if you're tired of buffets & fast food on the strip =]
5	Ate there for the 2nd time (6/22) and it was simply wonderful. The stuffed dates are delicious. Desserts are out of this world. Never a disappointment.
4	This place is fun and has great food.  I had the Crispy duck roll, Firefly fries, Empanadas, and the Mac n Cheese.  Very tasty.I will say that I prefer not to go when it's busy. A. The line gets long.  B. It's really loud.  This is the only reason for the 4 stars. :-)Also, the service has also improved since the last time I was here.  Normally I have to ask for my drink to be refilled.  The buser was right on it this time, filling my drink 3 times.
5	Love this place. The paella is awesome with a great balance of sauteed chorizo, mussels, chicken and shrimp. One of my favorite tapas meals are the bacon wrapped dates. They have a short happy hour during the week but they give half off on all their nice mojitos and the sangria. I personally like the paradise mojito which has the pineapple juice. Definitely a great place for Spanish tapas off the strip.
4	The tapas size is generally larger than those tapas restaurant that I have been too. Food was delicious. The mussel dish and padron peppers were two of my favorites. Definitely would like to come back when I am in town again.
4	Firefly is definitely a spot I must go back to each time I take a visit to Vegas.    Their menu consists of savory small dishes called tapas and everything on there just sounded great. They serve complimentary bread. This is always a plus. I tried the Firefly fries (so addicting), thai beef salad, mushroom tart, calamari, filet mignon sliders, paella, and tempura shrimp and veggies. I shared this with five other people, and I was completely satisfied. Oh, and don't even think about leaving this place without having their dessert, specifically their tres leches cake! Absolutely amazing! I'm not a huge fan of cake, but this...this hits the spot! Overall, Firely is a nice place to dine at, especially with a date. I'm knocking off a star just because of how dim it is in there. My eye sight sort of sucks, so I had to place my cell light over the menu to read the menu. Haha
4	This place is quite small & off the main vegas strip, but the food here will definitely satisfy your stomach!Bacon-wrapped dates, sliders & firefly fries are a must try!Check it out whenever you're in Vegas!
4	Yay!  I'm a big fan!  I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas and will certainly recommend to all my friends.  Awesome vibe, reasonably priced and the drinks are sooo good.  I've never had white sangria before but one of my friends recommended it to me and so glad she did.  It was tasty and sweet and, as they say on their website, it gave me maximum enjoyment.   This place is excellent for lunch, dinner or happy hour with 50% off all drinks.  Or just stay here all day and enjoy all 3 meals of the day (yes, happy hour in my book is a meal.)As for food, my friends and I had the stuffed dates, ham and cheese croquettes, crispy duck roll, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom and the merguez (spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit and grilled bread).  I could pass on the croquettes and duck roll but loved the dates, chicken/chorizo and the merguez.  Hmmmm....oh so good.  I think back on all of these oh so fondly.  I'm reading about the mac n' cheese from the other reviewers and I can't believe I missed that one - I think I was just so excited about all the yummy choices, I inexplicably overlooked it (shameful).  Highly recommend this place.  If you're tired of the other cheap options on the strip or can't afford to go to all of the nice places for every meal (incl happy hour), go to Firefly.  It'll be worth your while.
5	Awesome!  Affordable, wonderful food - definitely try the sausage and the meatballs!  Sangria was fantastic.  Ambiance was wonderful - sat outside.  Tremendous value for Las Vegas!  Well worth the trip off the strip.  Would most definitely go back again!
5	I bring my out of towners here.  I'm actually going here tonight, my mom is in town, it's a perfect place close to the hotels.  It's off the strip but it's still fun.  Always crowded, great music, great food, affordable, what else do you want??Not to sound like a groupie, but the items recommended on yelp are seriously fantastic.  Terra y mare skewers, filet mignon sliders, stuffed dates.  Go with the big guns, fantastic.  I have yet to have a drink hereMy personal favorite is mac n cheese.  But how can that go wrong?  Even the Kraft microwavable boxes I find delicious.Cute date spot, great for a group of friends, love this spot.
4	Great drink selection including wines, great prices and good service!  The filet sliders are beyond awesome!  Wayne Gorsek
5	Why I have not raved about this place yet, I don't know. It's my go-to place when I have visitors, when I just want to sit with a friend over coffee and sangria, dine with family, have a girls' night, a business meeting, or a date. So, really, any damn time is a good time for Firefly.My besties were visiting this weekend and we made Saturday night a date night, stopping here before hitting the town. The Mrs. had been here with me a couple years ago but this was the first time Mr. had been. Sacrificing virgins to Firefly is a great way to spend an evening!We knew there would be a wait, so I put my name in and we headed to the bar for a pitcher of the red sangria. Unlike the cold red wine I had recently in another establishment, Firefly sangria is *real* sangria. Real fruit, real care, real flavors. I have come here just for the sangria. Top notch.The atmosphere, I find, is always one of two things: boisterous and social and fun (without being overwhelmingly loud), or quiet and casual. Tonight was the former, and it was perfect. Patrons at the bar were engaging and personable, yet we still had our space, our own conversations, and time to ourselves while we waited. People watching is a must.We were offered a table after only ten minutes or so and led to a hightop out on the patio. It was a little warm (duh, I know), and just as they bring heaters outside in the winter, some low-breeze fans would make a difference in the summer. When we were hit with a natural cross breeze, we noticed a huge difference. Just a thought.Mmmm... FOOD! Stuffed dates, of course. Crispy, rich, and amazing. The Mrs. and I knew this going in. The Mr. is now a fan. Yay! A new disciple!Eggplant canneloni, one of my favorites. I can't eat pasta, so this is a great, mouthwatering twist of goat-cheesy goodness on an old Italian standby! Molto bene!Albondigas (meatballs). The Mrs. and I didn't care too much for the dish overall. I found the meat a little dry but raved about the flavors of the sauce. The Mr., however, really enjoyed them.The ceviche was good as far as the seafood and avocado, but there was too much of the liquid in the dish and it had a little too much of an acidic flavor. The gazpacho was FANTASTIC. Some of the best any of us ever had. So fresh, so clean, just this side of spicy, and at once simple and complex in the layering of flavors. Really, really amazing. A must have.The steamed mussels were good... until we found a rotten one. It was only one, but it ruined the dish for us. On the plus side, the liquid and the mussels WERE very good and tasty, but for that one... So we talked to the waiter, showed him, and sent it back without a replacement (which was offered, of course). It was too bad, truly, and I will be trying them again.The lamb chops came out medium rare instead of rare and those we had replaced. Everyone was great about it and they came out the second time perfectly cooked, melt-in-your mouth tasty. The bed of veggies and lentils are more than a salad or garnish, but a dish of their own. Also amazing and very well received.Instead of dessert we opted for a second pitcher of the red sangria and enjoyed the space, each others' company, and the buzz of the people around us. Service is always top notch, friendly, and helpful. The hiccups tonight were just that, hiccups. They were addressed as they should be and the experience was still fantastic. A great night and a great example of why this place is a 5-star favorite everytime I go.
4	We had a large group of 7 and we wanted to avoid the strip prices on our recent vegas trip.  This place is recommended by all of my local friends and very close to the strip.  We were really happy because they serve food until 2am.  We showed up at 11p.  There was a short wait for a table so we opted to put 2 tables together in the lounge.  The lounge area has lower tables and small ottoman looking stools to sit on which are pretty comfortable.There was light music in background..and we started with 2 ptichers of sparkling sangria.  It was amazing!  They marinate they sangria for 3 days minimum.  Here is what we ordered:*Tuna tartare...fresh mixed w avocado and served w taro chips - very good*Shrimp diablo... good kick slightly sweet - good not amazing*Firefly fries - awesome!*Stuffed dates..not for those watching waist but delicious - delicious! one of my favorites*Ceviche shrimp super bland just taste of lime - would not order again*Salsa verde chorizo shrimp skewers - one of my favorites*Filet sliders...covered in scallion blue cheese w a home made mayo with slight kick of cayenne.  THese were good but not amazing.  I was surprised because they had such good reviews.  They come with some fried onions.  The bun was crisp so it is a well executed dish, I just wanted better flavor. *Steak skewers w mushroom..sauce is quite bland, parlsey.  Steak cooked to a perfect medium rare - good for a simple eater.*Mac and cheese excellent not too rich not greasy slightly crisp topping not the overwhelming cheddar tasteThis was a great spot for our group and a great light meal for preclubbing.  You can take small bites and share everything.The lounge has great artwork that creates a sexy vibe against the red walls.Many large groups were around us and still eating/celebrating different occassions.  I would definitely return on my next trip.  Reasonable prices, good fun and a fun place.
5	Everything was great.  Service was quick, attentive, and friendly, and not intrusive.  Blood orange mojito was incredible and very refreshing.  The plain mojito was not great, either over-muddled or using old mint, as it was very bitter and the mint was black in places.  The tortilla espanola was the least favorite dish.  It was okay, but the potatoes were underseasoned and undercooked and the dish as a whole was nothing special.  On the other hand, the patatas bravas, the mac 'n' cheese, the steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed peppers, artichoke toast, fried calamari, were all to die for.  I believe we had one other dish as well.  Stuffed peppers were my personal favorite this trip.  Perfect balance of creamy and flavorful, sweet and spicy.  Textures and flavors all went quite well together.  Also, the chocolate tres leches cake was one of the best desserts I have ever had, and I'm not even a chocolate person.  Texture was great, and the bitter cocoa flavor of the chocolate sponge cake balanced the sweetness of the milks.  Firefly is definitely a winner.
5	When you order the stuffed dates, order 4 orders...
3	First of all, take a taxi. Being Vegas novices we tried the monorail and besides being expensive we still had to walk nearly a mile in Vegas heat. Our next move was a good one though. We started out with a pitcher of the red sangria which was wonderful. I think we could have downed another pitcher easily, but it was lunch even if we were tourists in LV. The server helped guide us through the extensive menu. Our dishes were overall pretty good though the sangria was better. Standouts included the blue cheese sliders and the bacon wrapped dates.  Skip the paella. It was pricey and mediocre.
5	This is my go to place for happy hour and taking out of town guests.  Happy hour is daily from 3-6 (5 on Fridays).  The drinks are half off.  Tapas is a great option for a snack or light dinner.  The prices are right and slightly off the strip for visitors.  My favs are the blood orange mojito and the baked tetilla.
5	Truly impressed. Every single dish was amazingly good and we ordered about 18 different dishes.  Ceviche lamb chops sangria skewers clams mussels sliders and much more.  All desserts were delish as well.  This will be my Vegas stable in the future.  I enjoyed their sangria which is on the sweeter side - comes in red, white, or bubbly and you can get a pitcher if you want.Price was very reasonable - $5 - $10 per dish.  We spent over $500 at Del Frisco's the previous night and only around $210 at Firefly for more food, more drinks, and more fun.We got there around 6:00pm and was fortunate to grab the last 6-seater.  By the time we left around 8:00pm, there was a crazy wait list outside the door.  If Yelp allows me to give 6 stars, this would be one of the few restaurants that I would give a 6 star!
5	My first dining experience at Firefly was great and it was definitely not the last time I came here!  The food is delicious, drinks are great and the atmosphere is comforting, what better place to enjoy an evening with your friends right?  Some of my favorite things to get at Firefly include:* Red Sangria: Delicious and sweet!  If you are not a fan of sweet drinks, you may not like this, but for those who are still new to wines, the sangria here are a great way to get you started on drinking wine!  They even mention in their menu that they marinate the sangrias three days with fruits to get its full flavor!  Included in the glass or pitcher of the sangria are cubed apples which makes the drink even more fun! * Stuffed dates are a must when you come to Firefly, unless you're a vegetarian of course.  But anything wrapped with bacon and baked is dangerously delicious!  Those who are allergic to almond beware, the dates are stuffed with it. ;-) * Filet Mignon Sliders:  Delicious and juicy!  The burger meat is very tender and it comes with a side of fried onions, that go really well with the burgers.  This is something that you should not miss at Firefly! * Spicy Shrimp: I'm not entirely sure of the exact name, since it was in spanish, but it was delicious!  Beware, when it says spicy, it is sure damn spicy but also flavorful!  * Shrimp Ceviche: Served with fried won ton chips and has a tangy kick with each bite.  Not salty but very flavorful and refreshing.  There are many more dishes to get at Firefly, but these are just a few that I recommend getting, especially the first two mentioned.  Enjoy your experience at Firefly and don't forget! They also serve dessert! =)
4	So, after eating at countless restaurants on the strip we wanted to try something new. I give this place four stars instead of five because 1) the service is somewhat lacking and slow and 2) the parking issue but other than that, the food is delicious. We had a pitcher of their famous red sangria which is a definite must - sweet and perfect. We had about 8 different plates that we ordered and the portions are small so this was adequate for two people. Out of all the plates the one's that I recommend and would order again are:*mac & cheese - really very delicious*shrimp in lemon-garlic butter dish* shrimp, chorizo sausage, and filet mignon skewers*bacon wrapped dates*ham and cheese*firefly friesFor dessert we had the dessert sampler and the bread pudding. The dessert sampler is not too great and I wouldn't recommend it, but the bread pudding was actually pretty nice. This place is JAM PACKED and parking can be hard to find (we lucked out). Highly recommend this place though
5	Everything on the menu is my favorite here! One of my favorites in Vegas. I always recommend firefly on paradise. Try the stuffed dates,patatas bra vas, and sliders with a pitcher of sangriammmmmmmm
4	bacon wrapped dates, so good. I've never had a date and I wasn't sure about the blue cheese, but it's just a smokey-bacony bite. shrimp ceviche- awesomely goodsliders - ugh i could've eaten 4 of these, what do they put in here??ps: we thought that there was some weird sweet butter on the bread plate, but it's actually almond butter! yum
4	I was in Vegas working a show for about a week and hit up Firefly while there. It was a really cool, chill vibe, hard to find in Vegas. I'm vegetarian and it's sometimes a challenge to find good veg friendly food, but I succeeded admirably at Firefly! Things to note:1) It's in a strip mall, which seems weird, but don't let it sway you.2) The patatas bravas were #$*#@#-ing amazing.  Probably the best I've had a a tapas joint.3) The wines are a good pour.The staff was friendly and nice, I was never in want of water.  Of course we were outside and even being 11pm it was balls hot out.  I had a garden salad too which was good.  I tried the veggie empanada which was okay, nothing to write home about.All in all Firefly was swell, I will definitely go there again.  Not too far from the strip, we were at the Riviera and I think our cab ride was about 10 bones.  Check it out if you're in Vegas and sick of the nasty buffet food.
5	I have been here a handful of times- ALWAYS a great place. Yes you need to drive here, not a walk from the strip. But so worth it. This last time I got the Mac 'n cheese, meatballs, dates wrapped in bacon, oh and a mojito....so good! It gets busy and noisy-make sure to call for a reservation!
4	Great little off the strip place to check out. Went here during summer at around 10pm, and didn't want to wait, so just decided to get the first available seat, outside! It was a bit miserable sitting in the heat, but that's when you get a refreshing drink to cool you down!As for food, almost everything we got was delicious. They use manchengo cheese for their mac n cheese that I absolutely love, and have not seen it ever used for mac n cheese. Got the sliders which were delicious, but I had to scoop off some of the cheese cuz I can only have so much blue cheese. Patata bravas were some of the best I've had at a tapas placeI'll definitely be checking this place out again for a delicious off the trip restaurant.
4	I normally don't go off the strip for restaurants so this was the exception. I normally have pretty high expectations for tapas and this place didn't disappoint. We had a ton of different tapas and most were dead on. The tuna tartare was good.The stuffed peppers, albondigas and skewers were all really good. My favorite might have been the artichoke toasts. The sangria was okay and the infused vodka was actually really good. The best part is that I felt like we ate and drank a lot and the final tab was probably 1/2 of what I thought it would be! Great food for great value!
5	Get the sangria!
4	Very tasty-yes; the stuffed dates are a must.  Nice to find a place in Vegas that's not either cheesy or super high end.   Just a good place to have a nice dinner.
5	I am late in finishing this review and can't wait to get back!! As mentioned in other reviews this place is off the strip and you can tell mainly for locals. There was a minimal wait to be seated but okay since we were getting started on our pitcher of Sangria. I have been to Spain and the tapas here are very authentic and the customer service is excellent. What we ate: Red sangria, firefly fish sticks, lamb chops, apple and manchego salad, camarones a la diabla, veggie empanada, chocolate cherry bread pudding, banana nutella sandwich. All delicious!!
3	I'm still a fan of Firefly, but for some reason I think this place is beginning to rub me the wrong way. Maybe it's because when they had their place downtown I really enjoyed going there over going to the Paradise location and now I'm forced to go to the Paradise location because the downtown location closed.I went here last night and shared Sangrias with a group of friends and also ordered some ceviche. My boyfriend had never been here before and he didn't seem too impressed. He (and I) were incredibly annoyed by the very, very loud group of girls to the right of us. We were seated in the front part of the restaurant in the couch area and they were directly to the right of us. At times I couldn't even hear my boyfriend and he was sitting right next to me. Good luck trying to hear the other people in my party.The sangria was good, our waiter was attentive and nice. The atmosphere is the same 'ol. Maybe I'm just ready to move on to a new place...
5	By far on of the best places in town and not to mention there services was phenomenal our server Carlos was amazing explained and answered ever question I had about the menu, and to think that the only reason I ever came to firefly's was for the passion fruit cheesecake, that is out of this world!!!!
5	I have to eat here at least once every time I come to Vegas. I thought it was a hidden gem, but noticed a lot of reviews on Yelp.Either way, the place is the best you can do for the price, and the variety (and huge menu) ensure that everybody is happy.When it comes to suggestions, get the Dates and be sure to drink Red Sangria. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the duck, but that's like one item out of 60.
5	This place was hands down the best restaurant I ate at in Vegas - and I ate everywhere.  The neighborhood is shady and it is a strip mall (which normally means I won't even bother reviewing) but the food - omg the food was out of this world.  The prices were perfect, the portions were ample, and the service was phenomenal.  I can not recommend this place enough, just make sure you make reservations!
4	Good for half off drinks for happy hour! The sangrias are good. only got to try the white sparkling  this is all tapas style food which i love cause it is perfect for sharing.. the price was not bad at all.  $10 or less most are below 7.  Any place where they give complimentary seasoned garlic bread with yummy butter is a yes for me
5	There's only one thing that's bad about this place...  the wait!  This food is as good as it gets and at a fraction of the price you will pay for the big names on the strip.  Its not an elegant dining room, its tight and usually a bit noisy, but the food is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  If you've never eaten here, shame on you.  Come in and order a variety of dishes and you will be BLOWN AWAY by all of them!  Words can't describe the wonderful flavors on the menu.  I moved to Vegas from Orange County just so  I could eat here all the time!
1	After reading the positive reviews, my friend and I were looking forward to tasting everything on their menu.I was a little surprised they brought out the food so quickly because we ordered a lot of plates.  I don't know if it was an off night for them, but everything on our table was very sub par, including the bread which was dry, cold, and bland.Very disappointing to say the least and makes me take more into consideration of other reviewers with a grain of salt.
5	what an off strip find in vegas..i'm not sure if you can call them tapas because their portions are so freaken huge.. usually when u go to tapas places their portions are like 2 bites each.. this place nearly doubles those portions.. we went in a big group and ordered about 3 tapas per couple.. plus a paella to share.. and boy that was ALOT of food.. the server was really nice and chatted with us even thought they were pretty stacked.. i wish he had told us that we were overordering.. but too much of a good thing is never a bad thing. one very cool thing was.. that they forgot to put the seafood into our paella.. i didn't even notice.. until they brought a second one to the table WITH seafood.. that was a sweet doubleup...highlights are the patatas bravas... tierra y mar skewers.. beef shrimp AND chorizo? i'm in heaven... stuffed dates.. camarones diablasdef a must visit in vegas restaurant.
5	I've been hearing about Firefly for 2 years now from a co worker and I finally get to try it.The food was awesome.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, lamb skewers, mussels with red curry, smoked salmon toasts, french fries, mac and cheese, and the tres leches chocolate cake.My favorite were the dates and the chocolate cake. I want to try the paella next time.We came in around late lunch me, the hubby and kiddies.  It wasn't very crowded  yet so we were able to sit at the lounge area with the comfy sofas and tables.We will definitely go back again =)
5	The food is amazing! It's a great place to go with friends and taste a little bit of everything.
4	After reading such good reviews on Yelp, my husband and I came here on Saturday night. What impressed us was that we arrived at probably the busiest time with no reservation, and had a minimal wait for a table. The mango mojito was definitely something I would have again, and the food was, as the other reviewers stated, very good. Not in my top ten, but I could see myself coming back and bringing friends. We ordered the ham & cheese croquettes, ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls w/ cherry sauce, and the dessert plate...no complaints, but next time we will probably order something different off of their expansive menu. Some cons - It was very dark inside, to the point that I thought my ahi tuna was tomatoes because I couldn't see. It was very very loud, but I guess that's expected at prime time on a Saturday. There was almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser.
4	We went here before a crazy night our for a bachelorette party. We organized our reservation through a VIP party package which included transportation, a show, and club access on the strip -- and dinner and drinks at Firefly! So in short - we got a great value.I loved almost everything that was served. My favorites being the veggie empanadas, beet salad, and spicy shrimp.One of our guests cannot have peppers and unfortunately there were peppers in a lot of the foods, but, I suppose this should be expected with Spanish tapas.The sangrias were delish! Restaurant was VERY crowded and a little loud. Ambiance was trendy and romantic - great date spot.
4	FINALLY! Man, after a nightmare dinner last night, I was relieved to find this place for lunch! UH MAZINGGG! Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. We shared the mushroom with puffed pastry, warm spinach salad lightly coated with balsamic and goat cheese, empenadas, and calamari with aioli. Soo soo good! Everything was moderatley priced round 4-5 per tapa, the service was on the money, and an overall great casual dining experience. If you're in Vegas I recommend this place big time!
5	My favorite place in Vegas!! So good.. I love tapas.. so delish.. I love being able to try different things and I haven't had one bad thing from here.I try to go for happy hour and sit at the bar. The bartenders are really nice and quick. Happy hour drinks are half off and you get a free plate of appetizers. It's a small portion of 3-4 items but free! The drinks are so good.. mojitos and sparkling sangria.. must try!Food is amazing.. if you don't like it then you are seriously insane!
5	Firefly serves up consistently gorgeous tapas, it's my favorite place to catch up with friends in town.Fav dishes are the ceviche (OMG!), the stuffed dates (OMG OMG!) and the sliders (m'kay I'm hungry now!). All of the aforementioned should most definately be washed down with the delicious sangria which flows freely at Firefly. If you've never been here, you're seriously missing out!
5	This place was amazing!! I've been trying to find a place like this in San Diego,  Unfortunately, I will have to miss this until I go back to Vegas.  This place is always crowded on the peak times people usually want to eat.  But my friends and I got very lucky having the munchies so late at night and on the weekday.  The most unforgettable tapas for me was the Stuffed Dates!  Bacon wrapped, creamy filling and just a perfect blend of taste all the way around.  Who doesn't like bacon?  Maybe Vegetarians will be transformed to be meat eaters after eating this dish.  They have a pretty good sangria and I love their restaurant set up.  I felt very comfortable especially in their large booths for large groups!  I suggest you come early and make reservations!
3	I had a ho hum experience at Firefly.Our party wanted to have a lighter fare for dinner before hitting the clubs later that night (and the pool the next day) so we though tapas would be a great idea.I tried the sliders, bacon wrapped dates, and macaroni cheese. The sliders I think were the best thing I tried, followed closely by the dates. The mac and cheese was nothing special. I looked around and everything were a decent size and price. Everyone seemed happy with what they got. I also tried the sangria which again, was lackluster in my opinion. It did nothing really to continue my buzz started earlier on in the day.We also had two or three of our tapas "forgotten" so when we checked with the waiter, the explanation was that the order was never written down. Oh well, not a huge loss.Not bad, but again, not compelling enough for me to come back when I am in Vegas again. It is a little out of the way from the strip so plan accordingly, our taxi driver got lost on the way there...
5	Great place to eat tapas (without having to deal w/traffic, parking, reservations, tourists on the Strip).  We liked the following...Sangria (red wine) PitcherBacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates... wonderful Pecan surprise insideShrimp Diablo... sauce is the real winner in this oneHam and Cheese Croquetas... comfort food
4	Wow, what a nice trendy place to get a few bites and drinks before hitting the club! I came on a Thursday night and this place was definitely 'poppin' with people. Myself + two decided to sit at the bar due to the quicker service.  This was only my second time here and it had been years since my first visit. A lot of tapas to choose from, creating a great variety! The prices were also very inexpensive, which already puts this place on my good list. The other 2 weren't too hungry so they opted to order a few drinks while choosing to nibble on calamari. However, I came with an empty stomach so I choose the Thai Beef Salad which sounded very appetizing at the moment. The calamari was pretty standard and would satisfy anyone's craving for this fried seafood appetizer. However, the Thai Beef salad was basically a salad with beef. Nothing in it made it Thai other than the name. Other than the so so salad, definitely a great experience and will be coming here more often with friends before getting our dance on at the club.
3	After reading such good reviews on Yelp, my wife and I came here on a Saturday night. What impressed us was that we arrived at probably the busiest time with no reservation, and had a minimal wait for a table. The food was, as the other reviewers stated, very good. Not in my top ten, but I could see myself coming back and bringing friends. We ordered the ham & cheese croquettes, ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls w/ cherry sauce, and the dessert plate...no complaints, but next time we will probably order something different off of their expansive menu. Some cons - It was very dark inside, to the point that I thought my ahi tuna was tomatoes because I couldn't see. It was very very loud, which I wasn't quite expecting because I was told it would be a nice intimate place to get wine and apps. But there were bachelorette parties and a lot of college kids (not too far from UNLV) making the place really...REALLY...loud. I guess I wasn't expecting this place in a nice little strip mall (next too a few other upscale places like Ruth Chris' Steak House) to be so much like a bar.There was also almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser. It's not too too expensive either, so that's nice.We may go back eventually, but maybe during a less busy time.
4	Really enjoyed the atmosphere, food, & prices. We will definitely go back again.
5	my goodness, what an amazing 'off-the-strip' eat. I echo my fellow colleagues in saying the bacon wrapped dates are heavenly and the red sangira is absolutely delicious. It gets pretty busy so I would go before 7pm if you don't want to wait to get seated. What to orderBacon Wrapped Dates: If you have a party of 4 or more, I would get 2 orders of these. One will only have you itching for more.  They are fantastic; the perfect combination of sweet and saltyTierra y Mar skewers: Each skewer has a distinct flavor and is perfectly seasoned. One order is probably enough because you want to be trying all the other wonderful things on this menu!Lamb Chops: I have died and gone to food heaven. The spices in this dish was incredible and the lamb was so tender.  Even for non-lamb lovers, there is no gamey taste so don't worry!HighlightsFood, food, food, sangira, food, foodIt's SO decently priced!! 4 of us, 7 plates with a pitcher of sangira $100!LowlightsI don't really have any. Well, there can be a wait if you go too late ie. after 7:30pm. Also if you are looking for something romantic and intimate, Firefly may be a little noisy for you. You can still have a conversation but if I whispered sweet nothings to my hunny... he wouldn't be able to hear it :)
4	Great little Tapas bar just off the strip!   Out in Vegas for convention and to escape ACL in Austin lol.Used Yelp to find this place and not disappointed.   Great cozy atmosphere buzzing with life. Dark, with a great pulse, and original art on the wall.   My kind of place.  Table wait was about 45 minutes on a Wednesday but found a spot at the bar in 10 minutes.  Bar tenders were very attentive even whilst making gallons of fresh Sangria. Yum.  Have me two of those please!  Perfect!   Off to a great start so far.Ordered the beacon wrapped dates for starters, very tasty.  Then moved on to a Petit Felit, and Tuna Tart tart.   All good.  In between I through in a perfectly on-point mojito and finished off with some gelato.   All and all a very solid and a fun experience.  Compliments again to the bartenders for great service.  Always nice to find an authentic little spot off strip in Vegas.   Without Yelp I might have missed this one, you shouldn't.
5	I love this place. I discovered it one day walking down paradise blvd cause I was staying off the strip @ the Marriott. It's a Tapas place I have taken almost everyone of my friends to when I go to Vegas with. The prices are so much cheaper then the casino. When you there order the ribs, Mac n cheese, shrimp diablo, Thai beef salad, and the fries. Everything is super tasty and delicious. Its open late but it's perfect food for when you plan to go out to the clubs and party. Stop by and try it.
3	Disappointed.  I had such high expectations for this place and the food was just OK at best.  The bacon wrapped dates was the best item that we had and even then, it was super oily.  Everything was just way too greasy and salty.  On the bright side, the portions and prices were reasonable ($5-15 plate). Parking is easy and service is pleasant.
4	Tasty Ceviche and yummy sliders.
5	I don't know where to start on this place. Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat here once. Happy hour is amazing!  MUST HAVES: chorizo stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, sliders and the 3 day marinated sangrias.I recommend making reservations on thurs-sat nights it gets packed!!
5	Servers were really nice, usually restaurants with reputations like Firefly have snobby servers but everyone was really accommodating and nice. The food was great! We tried the Tuna Tartar, Filet Mignon Sliders, Spicy Shrimp, and clams. Everything came out fresh and at perfect temperatures. All of the dishes were perfectly seasoned and I would definitely recommend this place!
4	Friends had gone on our last trip to LV and I was elsewhere. so I went with them on this next trip.  They loved it and I have to agree..it really was a nice place, cool scene but relaxed.  The food was excellent.  We had like 12 different tapas and sangria.  Really everything was pretty cool.... Definitely hitting it again next time.  With Tapas everyone has their favorite type of food so tough to say whats best.  we ordered all different types and they were all really good
4	OMG~ DELICIOUS!!!!!!!After attending my cousin's White Coat ceremony for  Touro University at Rio Hotel, we ate dinner at Firefly's.  As we waited for our waiter, we were given bread and butter.  I don't know what the butter was made out of but it was so good!  Now,  onto the REALLY GOOD stuff.This is what we ordered:*Apple and Manchego salad - GOODGreen apple, manchego cheese, smoked almonds*Tuna Tartare - If you've tried Wolfgang Puck's Tuna Tartare, Firefly's comes in a close secondMarinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips*Tuna Peppers - DELICIOUSSmoked yellowfin tuna salad, stuffed in marinated peppers*Tomato-Basil Soup - Tomato soup was good but if you dip the brie in the soup, it tastes a little funkyTomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich*Veggie Empanada - OKSpinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese, red pepper aioli*Thai Beef Salad - I've had better at Coconut Bay or PresidenteSeared beef, thai dressing, romaine, tomato, cucumber, giner*Baked Filets of tilapia - SO GOODMarinated with herbs, lemon, garlic*Chicken Skewers - YUMMYMarinated chicken, tomato, roast garlic cream*Crispy Duck Roll - I'm not much of a duck fan so I didn't try but everyone else loved itCherry hoisin sauce*Tierra y Mar Skewers - OK, Meat was kind of hard to pull off the skewerGrilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde*Filet Sliders - DELICIOUSMini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions*Ceviche of ShrimpTiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortillas*Babyback Ribs - GOOD - Meat slides right off the boneMango BBQ sauce*Camarones Ajillo - GOODShrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauceUnfortunately, despite eating all of the glorious food, I had a stomach ache and had diarrhea.  However, I would eat Firefly's and experience diarrhea again.  I think it's worth it.  =)The total amount was $104.32.  Not bad at all.  We split the tapas between five people and we came out stuffed.
5	This place is dynamite son!I had pretty much the whole menu since I came with a big party and everything, I mean everything, was fire.  Best of the best in Las Vegas so far.  I will make this spot a stop in my list for every trip I take to Vegas.  The sangria was also really good.  I have no idea what kind of butter they serve with their side bread but I gained 10lbs just eating that junk.  ooo weeee 5 Stars all the way!  Great service too.
5	Perfect starter to a wild Vegas night.I love tapas joints and this is one the best.  The menu here is excellent with a wide variety of original dishes that wont break the bank.  The ambiance is loungey hip and the service is excellent.  Ive been here several times with large groups and they have catered nicely to us each time.  Place is pretty popular so dinner time usually has a wait but there is a bar for you to pass the time.  Here are some of my favorite plates:Filet Mignon Sliders - Juicy patty full of flavor and deep fried onion strings on top give it a crunch.Firefly Fries - Goes great with the sliders and good item to share.Chorizo Clams - Delicious! Chorizo adds richness and the broth makes a great dip for the bread.Crispy Duck Roll - Kind of a small dish, but if your into duck this thing is bomb.Stuffed Dates - Just a real tasty little concoction with great flavor.  Very good appetizer to start things off.This place is an off the strip secret for some great fine dining and a perfect warm up to some good times.  Parking is a little tough but you'll manage.
4	Great food! The filet mignon sliders were delicious! Mac n cheese was good not great. Love the ambiance.
2	I think we tried about 7 or 8 dishes and only the ribs and calamari stood out. Bacon wrapped figs didn't do anything for me. Joint is cheap and boisterous if that's what you're looking for.
4	I love this place. It's great before going out. For the most part the food is appetizer style, so you won't get too full or have left overs. They have a little bit of eveything. There's fish, chicken, steak or vegetarian. And their drinks are yummy, I recomend the Sangria (they have red and white). Everyone should make this stop on their trip to Las Vegas.
5	Good drink prices even if its not happy hour. Their sangria's are delicious! Amazing food...at least what i ordered was yummy....a Vegas hot spot! Loved it definitely will go again soon!
4	I went here before a night out on the strip to celebrate my birthday and was absolutely impressed.the food was delicious, and we were able to get so much food, and their wonderful sangria, for an incredible price.this was my first tapas experience and I am hooked.  I still get cravings for their delicious truffle fries!!
4	This place has delicious tapas.  It is a great place to go when you want a taste of a little bit of everything.
5	In the words of the effervescent and poorly dress MC Hammer this place is: Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey! Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey!Located in a strip mall near the Las Vegas Convention Center, it would be very easy to overlook Firefly and run off to its more glamorous competitors...but I'm so happy we took a cab to enjoy this local favorite. The atmosphere at Firefly has a friendly and slightly frantic feel to it as it's packed to the brim with a mix of tourists and locals. We waited by the bar and met some really nice people who we chatted with and they offered us some of their food. Wow, how nice is that?!We were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived and were taken outside to another door which opened to the other half of the restaurant. I guess they expanded but didn't knock down the wall in between. We didn't really care, we were just happy to get a table quickly! As other reviewers have written the small plates can get pricey, especially if you've got a YELP sized appetite, but the food is delish! We ordered 10 different dishes and all you have to know is three words: Bacon wrapped dates. Do it, do it right now you fool!Yelp 365 Challenge: #48/365 (The Dates)
5	Rasberry and blood orange mojito and lamb skewers this time. mmmhhh everything was to die for.
4	Cozy restaurant off the beaten Vegas path. Glad we decided to cab it and go outside of the strip. Tapas is not normally my thing, BUT this was quite enjoyable. They were able to accommodate our group of 10 even after we arrived late for our reservation. And yes I would recommend a reservation, this place was pretty packed.The stuffed dates and the mac n cheese REALLY stood out. Definitely a good place to get the night started or even as a chill spot to have tapas and some drinks if you're looking for a mellow night.
5	Firefly is my go to place when I stop my gambling frenzy and realize that all the typical restaurants have already closed and I'm hungry.  So whether you want to load up on a bunch of tapas or are just looking for a place to drink without having to talk over loud club music, this is worth going to.  I had a whole bunch of dishes and can't remember them all so I just wrote a few of the memorable ones:Tuna Tartare:  layers of mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips.  Can you say yum?Ceviche of shrimp:  tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla.  Just the right marinade of flavors mixed together.Stuffed dates:  bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  If you told me to order this, I would decline.  But if someone else is ordering it, of course it's obligatory to try, right?  O-M-G.  What a delightful surprise of deliciousness!  A group of us went and shared a whole bunch of dishes so it was perfect, while we talked and drank.  There was a slight wait, even at 11pm at night but we didn't mind since we could order drinks at the bar.  Enjoy!
5	It's hard not to love this place, the food, atmosphere and service is all very good.Thanks to yelp reviews and some TV time, I found out about this gem and learned it's a locals favorite.Took a 2.6mile walk from the Circus Circus (Thank goodness you can drink on the street), a little long but good exercise.  Got to this place, pretty typical strip mall but could tell this place was popular.Walked in to the lounge area, awesome atmosphere and was seated right away on one of their low couches.  Scanned the menu, ordered some drinks and some food.Bacon Wrapped Dates - Perfect!Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms - DecentChorizo Clams - AmazingAbsolutely great experience, 3 dishes and 3 drinks for the two of us and we got out of there for around $50, wish we had time to go back, this is definitely somewhere you don't want to miss on a visit to Vegas, it's worth going out of your way for.Also because this place is so popular, there are always a taxi or two waiting outside, very convenient.
5	We were a group of 8 and ordered over 20 dishes.  My friend put it most eloquently: amazingestballs.
4	I was pleasantly surprised. Carlos, was great, helping us choose our tapas. We will be back!!
4	My wife and I dined at Firefly on Paradise tonight. We ate an early dinner at 5pm on a Monday. It was also a holiday, but it wasn't as busy as I expected. Happy hour was in full swing though and the outside seating area was packed. My wife and I weren't there for the happy hour so we were seated immediately inside the restaurant. We had the option of choosing a regular table or a table with a couch. We chose the table with the couch. It's nice especially if you're planning on staying to lounge for a while.The service was excellent. The waiter checked up on us frequently and drinks were constantly refilled.Our dinner: Empanada - $4.50, Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms - $5, Filet mignon sliders - $7.50, Paella - $20, and the Dessert platter - $12. After tax $52.97, not including gratuity. Not bad. We were both stuffed and ordered more than enough food. We even had to take some home. The food was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. The best I've had was in NYC, but the food there is always the best in my opinion. However, Firefly is still good. If I were to go again, I wouldn't order the Filet mignon sliders and the dessert platter since they weren't as good as I'd hoped for. The Filet mignon sliders were decent, but I would skip the dessert all together.
5	This was my second time eating here.  Several of us stopped after a party for dinner.  We didn't arrive until around midnight.  I am always a little concerned when ordering food near closing time but we were pleasantly surprised.  The food couldn't have been better.Rodger was our waiter, he had one or two other servers helping and as is often the case, they really helped us enjoy the meal.  We ordered a few items and then asked Rodger to pick a few and surprise us.  He picked the Mac and cheese and bacon wrapped dates.  They were so good we ordered another order of the dates.  We also had a salad and a petit filet.  The salad was crisp and delicious; the filet very tender and cooked perfectly.  The rest of us had the paella - unbelievably good!  The saffron was not overwhelming, the seafood was plentiful and cooked just right.  I hate to admit it, but we ended up ordering another paella because it was so good.  With all that food for 4 of us, we took most of the second paella to go.  It was still good the next day!Great service, great food - love Firefly!  J
4	Oh yelp, you are my favorite travel buddy!  You help me out so much and you help me impress my friends.  We got into Vegas late, and I knew this place served small plates and sangria late into the evening (2 am), which was just what we needed!  We hopped in a cab and were taken not far off the strip for some delicious food to share.  FYI:  from NYNY the cab ride was just under $15.  This place is lit in a gorgeous red hue and it's very romantic!  Their menu has many tapas options.  Here's what we chose:-Beef and mushrooms skewers:  delicious and cooked well with a combination of yummy sauces drizzled over it.-Veggie empanadas:  empanadas are my tapas staple.  These hit the spot!-Stuffed red peppers:  great taste and texture!-Pitcher of sangria:  bold flavors...they let the mixture sit for 3 days!-Stuffed dates:  our friends ordered these and enjoyed them too.4 tapas plates and a pitcher of sangria totaled:  $55, which is pretty decent for Vegas prices!When in Vegas again, we will be back!  There's so much more to try.
5	I'm going to write this review from a different perspective this time, and that is from a large group dining situation.  I was in charge of planning a bachelor party dinner for a group of 25, and that proved to be no small task for Las Vegas.  Most of the places I tried wanted any combination of the following: a very strict prix fixe menu, a signed contract, a minimum of $100/person (not including alcohol, tax, and tip) and a 50% deposit up front.I usually stop by Firefly at least once every Vegas trip so I am well aware of how amazing their food is.  I figured to give them a shot at hosting our group after unsuccessfully booking at Tao, SushiSamba, and a number of other restaurants on the Strip.  Regina was extremely helpful, more so than I could have ever asked for!Firefly required a prix fixe menu, but they let me select 6 dishes + 1 dessert that would be served.  The choices I had were of a large variety so we had everything for literally every taste in the group.  The best part was that the food was all you can eat, so the restaurant brought out one complete round of the 6 dishes, and if anyone wanted any more of any dish, the kitchen would cook it right up and send it out.  Unlimited food and "basic" beverage (i.e. coffee, tea, soda) came out to be $32.50/person before tax and tip.  This was by far the best dinner value I found for a large group!  The next closest value I could find was $75/person at Tao.During the planning phase I must have emailed the restaurant a dozen times and every single time, Regina was very prompt with her response.  This was a great relief because I was so used to not getting a response from some of the restaurants on the Strip.  I don't quite understand why some of those other places would make it so hard for me to book a group reservation, but I am glad Firefly came in and saved the day.  They required a credit card number to hold the reservation, but nothing was charged until the day of the event.  This was very nice because I didn't want to have to front the entire bill for the group before the trip.This was my first large group planning, and I don't envy those of you charged with the same task.  Let me tell you, do yourself a favor and give Firefly a shot.  You can read virtually any of the other reviews to know about their food and atmosphere, but if you need reassurance that they can admirably handle your large group, I hope I have provided that.  Kudos to you, Firefly!
5	Real Tapas!! Delicious tapas! Estrella Galicia lager.  Killer Mojitos!
4	This is a great place to go if you want to get away from the Strip but you still want an upbeat atmosphere. The sangria was delicious and I loved the ceviche. The empanadas were a bit on the greasy side but they weren't terribly disappointing. This is a great place for a date. It has a local feel but it's just artificial enough to feel like the Vegas you know and love. The happy hour is fantastic but I wasn't able to make it in time. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely make another stop.
5	This is bar none the best restaurant we've been to on this vegas trip.  $3 margaritas, $3.5 mojitos, etc at happy hour made us extremely happy.  Great drinks at cheap prices.  Those happy hours on the strip can't compare to their drinks.  The food blew my expectations away.  Stuffed dates, diablo shrimp, paella, skewers were all freakin awesome.  The filet mignon sliders weren't bad either.  To top it all off, the service was great.  What more could you ask for in a restaurant?  Don't waste your money on the strip, save it for here, you won't be disappointed.
5	Excellent food, not too expensive.  Awesome service.  We had a small wait when we walked in without a reservation on a Monday night.It's dark, a little loud, and cozy.I love tapas, and these guys do it well.
5	Really, really liked this place.  Service was very quick.  Came in with 5 min to spare at end of happy hour.  Our server came right over and we managed to squeeze in an order of sangria before happy hour ended.  Diablo shrimp was my favorite.  A little sweet but excellent.  Stuffed dates were also very good.
5	Great place!  Tasty food, fast service, this is a great place to get off the strip for a quality meal.
5	OMG. I'm so in love. Make me wanna say OH OH OH. OMG.I love, love, love this place! It's works well for groups and dates. It's the everything place!Firefly is a tapas restaurant. Tell your friends it's a tapas place and they think it's a titty bar. For reals. I've never ordered anything here and not been pleased. There are a variety of different option: hot tapas, cold tapas, meats, seafood, vegetarian, and desserts. There are entree options, but ordering a variety of everything with a group of 4 or more is the way to go! They also have this plate with bread, olives, and butter that is complimentary. I have no idea what that herby-butter goodness is, but it blows my mind.What really wins me over is Firefly's mojitos (various flavors) and sangria (red, white, or sparkling wine options). They can be ordered by the picture and for a group of 4, everyone will have about 2 glasses a piece and it's a steal at $18. Venture off the Strip and get here people. You will not be disappointed. You will be delighted.The few downsides of this place are the looooong wait times at peak hours and the noise level. It is loud. It's even louder when their is a DJ blasting Spanish music. I deal with it, though. I also prefer to sit out side.
4	Amazing tapas place. And I'm not really a tapas guy. But my fella told me that he'd had a great experience here in the past, and wanted to check it out again.We stopped in and I was instantly enchanted by the aesthetic. Beautiful but understated. Liked it a lot. My dining companion ordered a bunch of things, and we sat back and waited on our drinks to arrive.The sparkling sangria. Oh. My. God. I could have sat and had this all day, were I not driving. It was fruity, fresh, sweet, delicious. One of the best drinks I've ever had.The tapas were a mixed bag, but I think that speaks more to my boy's tastes than to the quality of the food. The anchovies were (shocker) salty, the mussels were (shocker) a bit fishy. But everything else was delicious and I absolutely adored it all. I'll definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. No doubt about it. It was a highlight of the Vegas experience.
2	Friendly staff but concerning the food : VERY disappointed ! Spanish potatoes : still raw. The tuna tartare : too big cutted pieces. The meatballs : fresh made ? The shrimps tempura : 4 shrimps but the rest wasn't tasteful (our advice : delete it asap). The only thing that was good was the lamb : strong & lovely taste. The drinks : red sangria was ok (made with sprankling water) and the normal mojito was only too strong.We love Spanish food, but this was not a reference, sorry. I'm sure we will not return.
4	My friends and I decided to have a late dinner after a night of losing money and dignity - firefly definitely made up for our losses We all ordered three dishes each and shared it, i recommend trying as many things as you can because I have yet to have anything disappointing. Out of the 12 dishes we got only one was just average (the crispy duck roll) but even that was pretty good. My favorite two dishes of the night had to be the Ham/Cheese croquettes and the Filet Mignon sliders...i'm salivating right now thinking of them.
5	must add was there last Tuesday and now the skinny drinks they have added are awesome!! Could sip on them all night. And the Tuna Tar Tar  and mancheco mac n cheese shut the front french doors DELISCIOUS!!!!
5	I am going to steal the opening words from Raymond B's review. Not because he is my friend, but because he is intelligent, and one awesome dude."Life is all about"....great food, fantastic drinks, spent with people you care about. Ladies and gentlemen of Yelp....Firefly is that spot. I've used this spot as a go-to date spot, but most recently, I had two good friends in town from LA.We checked in for our reservation (make one, just in case), and we were promptly seated. Immediately, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (famous here), and a pitcher of Sangria (red). The Sangria marinates for three days, so you know it's legit.Then came out the rest of our food. The Manchego Mac n Cheese, the Chorizo plate, the stuffed mushrooms, the apple manchego salad...the list goes on. We went to down.Tapas at it's best.This is THE best place to eat and drink with those you care about, and with those you want to impress. If you are from out of town, make sure you stop in. 700+ reviews. Vegas knows how to do food. This place lives up to the hype.
5	Went here to eat with my husband and two friends.  Everything was fantastic!  Service, atmosphere, drinks and food.  Can't wait to go back for our birthday!!  Best eats in Vegas, forget the Strip..
5	My favorite place to go in Vegas, I always go back.  Fantastic Sangria, fantastic eats, friendly waitstaff, great atmosphere.  In our small group, we ordered an array of delicious delights, loving the mushroom tarts, the stuffed dates, and really pretty much everything we tried.  Usually there is one dish at a Tapas place that you don't like.  Not here.    Travel over off the strip, and go here.  It's been consistently wonderful for the last 5 years I've gone.
4	Fantastic food at any hour love this place!
5	LOVE this place. LOVE. In the last 3 years, I've been to Vegas at lease 12 times. No joke.  So how (HOW?!) is it possible that I've JUST had the pleasure of dining at Firefly? Shame on me, shame on me. Came here for dinner around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were seated right away (score!).  We ordered a handful of dishes and each dish left our table clean.  Not so much as a kernal of rice.  Everything was so amazing!The order:Stuffed Dates: Ummm...HEAVEN. MUST ORDER.  Dates stuffed with walnuts, wrapped with bacon and topped with crumbled cheese. No, it doesn't get any better. Camarones Al Aljillo: Garlic Butter shrimp.  Large shrimps drowned in decadent butter garlic sauce with toast for dipping. Need I tell you how delicious this was?Crispy Duck Roll: Super tasty--like pecking duck or eggrolls?  You'll love this. Chicken Skewers: Really good, but nothing special. Tuna Tartar: Sooooooooooooooo good!  Seafood Paella: Loaded with seafood! SUPER good...wonderfully seasoned. One of my favorite places in Vegas.  Will definitely be back and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Flan: Delicious! Banana sandwiches with nutella: Ummm...this dish didn't even last a minute.  We devoured it.  We drank all the nutella sauce.  It's that good.
5	Make reservations!  Were in LV for a seminar and had 8 pm reservations.  Walked in at 7:30 with hopes that they could take us in early but there was a mob of people waiting to be seated but lucky us, we had the foresight to make reservations so we were seated at 7:40 before anyone in the mob.Everything was amazing from food to service. I am a lover of great wine so was hesitant to order a sangria (code word for wine cooler) but  I finally had the red sangria and it was delicious.  I will definitely order one in the future.
4	4 1/2 StarsCame here on a Friday night with 2 other people and wait was about a good 20-30 minutes.  We hung out at the bar.  They have refreshing mojitos.The dishes themselves are fairly inexpensive, but they quickly add up.  It was a bit crowded but overall good service and even better food.I was weary about the food/restaurant since I hadn't had tapas before but was quickly impressed.  Must Try:-Mussels-Meatballs-Mac and Cheese-Croquettes-Ribs
1	Salmonella!!!!! Beware! Outbreak on last week of April and restaurant is CLOSED as of 5/1 because of poor health inspection and hospitalizations of patients.--------------------------------------http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2013/04/30/salmonella-the-culprit-in-firefly-outbreak/(Las Vegas, NV) -- Health district officials say salmonella's to blame for an outbreak at one of the most popular restaurants in Las Vegas, although the exact source is still unknown.Southern Nevada Health District officials say more than three dozen patrons reported food poisoning symptoms after dining at Firefly on Paradise Road. The restaurant was shuttered Friday and remains closed while health officials investigate.Salmonella can come from contaminated eggs, poultry, meat or produce, and can be transmitted through poor hygiene. Health district spokeswoman Stephanie Bethel said it's unclear where the bacteria came from.Health district official Amy Irani said Monday that 39 patrons reported symptoms, and 10 said they sought medical attention. Symptoms included diarrhea and vomiting.Results from the food samples may not be known until late in the week.
5	This is always my first recommendation for anyone who is looking for a guaranteed good meal and visiting Las Vegas for the first time. The stuffed dates are a party in my mouth! The ham and cheese croquetas are classic and fantastic.  The service is almost always on point considering they are busy from open to close. You can have an amazing meal here and still walk out with money in your pocket.
5	THIS IS THE BEST SPANISH RESTAURANT PERIOD!!! i have nothing but positive things to say about this place the dish's each time we go cooked to perfection and the atmosphere is great! the Paella(has shellfish shrimp and miscellaneous sea dwelling additives on Spanish rice) is by far my favorite and the mojitos are amazing as well.....if your ever near this place and wanna have a good meal ......look no further because you found it =)
5	I live in Vegas and I always enjoy going to Firefly.  It is my go to place to take people who come to town to visit.  There is a varied menu of tasty tapas with something for everyone.  Get a pitcher of sangria or mojito to really make things fun.  My wife and I have a handful of things that we enjoy, but after coming here many times with various people with different tastes, I have not had a bad dish here.  You can get out with a cheap lunch without drinks, but it is still reasonable for a full night of dinner and drinks.Firefly is packed late night, but if you can manage to get a seat it's a great late night snack.
4	LOVED it!  No doubt we would return.  Everything we had we were a fan of.  I could have skipped the desert platter (I LOVE desert and it wasn't rich enough for me :) )  We were very happy :)
5	Best. Sangria. PERIOD.Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again.
5	OMG this place is amazing!   Overall though - this place is absolutely phenomenal.  Amidst all the Michelin and 5-Star Zagat rated places this is a great local jewel that is excellent.  We shared Tomato-basil soup (served with mini grilled brie sandwich), Camarones a la diabla (its shrimp, served w/ spicy chile sauce, grilled bread), Tuna tartare (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips), and Steamed mussels (red curry, white wine and coconut cream).  The tomato soup was ok - not really anything to write home about - the combination with the grilled brie sand was what made the dish.  If you like grilled cheese its nice to try - and the sandwich was a small portion so perfect true tapas style.  The shrimp was really good - the sweet/spicy tangy sauce made it just amazingly tasty!  Tuna tartare (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips), was good, tuna was really fresh and the chip made a nice contrasting taste.   The mussels were actually really good - and I dont normally eat nor like mussels often, they were made really well with a lot of flavor was different.  Drinks wise, tasted both the (red-wine) Sangria and Raspberry Mojito.  Both were really well-made and I can think of the taste as I am writing this.  If you like red-wine - I agree with other opinions - Sangria is a must try! Couple of things to note - you should definitely try and make reservations - and also this is a $10-15 cab ride from the stip.  Additionally - the food tends to come out very fast so please be aware - they real do a good job at getting tables moving.  This is an excellent place, phenomenal value for money and probably a secret hide-out amidst the glitz and glamor of Vegas!  Looking forward to going back.  Only piece of advice - please please FireFly management have an area of the restaurant where the music is not soo loud and its a bit more mellow.
3	As much as I'd love to give this place four stars (even five), I had an unpleasant experience with a bartender here that ruined the aspect of customer service that's otherwise nice. I was waiting to get change from his register, and apparently the person in front of me was also getting change as well (at the time I didn't realize this). When I was next to get change, the bartender gave me a dirty look and shook his head like I was supposed to give my change to him at the exact moment the other person wanted it, for the convenience of making one trip to the register (which, yes, I could understand, but didn't realize the person in front of me was getting change too). It wasn't like he had to walk far to the register to get it, but he said something that I didn't hear since it was so loud (which probably wasn't good judging from the look on his face), and handed off my change with an attitude. On the plus side, I like the atmosphere for the sake of it always being festive, busy, and lively. There are some choices on the menu that I'd definitely pass up on (just because the portions are too small for the price they ask), but then again most of the items on the menu are delicious and have flavor to them. It's a great place to go for an outing with friends when you want to be festive, but not spend a fortune.
4	Love Love Love this place! One of our favorite spots in Vegas!  We always brought friends and family here when they came to visit! The atmosphere is great, food is great, service isn't the greatest but it won't ruin your experience! Must try the Stuffed Dates, the firefries, and the tapas Yum Yum Yum!! The Sangria's are awesome, and most (but not all) of the Mojitos are amazing! Stay away from the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwhich!Make reservations! It's ALWAYS crouded and there is ALWAYS a wait no matter what day or time!
5	Firefly has the best mojitos North of the Caribbean! My favorite is the their signature Paradise Mojito: coconut rum, pineapple flavor, mint, etc. -- simply delicious! If you're in the mood for a snack, their tapas aren't half bad either. The menu has something for everyone's taste including filet mignon sliders, stuffed peppers, macaroni and cheese, tres leches cake, and so much more! Everything on the menu tickles your taste buds with rich spices and unique flavor combinations.This place is a great setting for a light lunch, a date, or a late night snack. The atmosphere is fun and energetic with a Latin twist. The downside? Everybody agrees -- it can get a bit crowded on nights and weekends. But its worth it, trust me!
4	This is where the locals hang out. The place wasn't crowded and it was off the strip. I know when you go to Vegas you want to go all out and do all the touristy things, but for me... I like to hang out with the locals as well. The food was great and the place has a nice atmosphere. I love tapas style places. Definitely a good place to take a break from all of Vegas glam.
4	A great place for visitors and locals. It's got the local feel but the proximity to the strip makes it a great option for the visiting crowd. I highly recommend a reservation if you don't show up early. It's located in a small strip mall with lots of parking.For three of us, we got out under $60 (not including tip). The food was generally very good. However, there was one foul item - baked tilapia. This came as a recommendation, but the fish didn't taste fresh. It tasted like the frozen filets I get from Walmart.The mushroom tart was a really nice portion. I'm not a fan of cream cheese and since Boursin is like cream cheese, I strayed away from the cheesiest parts. Anything puff pastry and mushrooms is good in my book and it was a hit with my tablemates.The tuna tartare was delicious. The taro chips were a nice addition - texture and flavor-wise. The three chips only lasted through half of the tartare so I would recommend you save your free bread and use that. Frankly, the tartare was seasoned nicely enough that I had no problem eating it alone!The ham a cheese croquetas were like an upscale hot pocket. There are three to an order and it was just good enough for a taste. Good comfort food.The crispy duck roll was a hit with one but I wasn't wowed by it. It just seemed like a shredded pork egg roll with some hoisin sauce and chopped scallions. Solid, but I won't be ordering this next time.The lobster escargots were FANTASTIC. I hope this is a consistently cooked dish because everyone should try this once. The lobster was cooked just enough so it was super tender and had great flavor. A definite repeat for my next visit.I had the paradise mojito based on some other reviews. The flavor was nice, but if you're not a fan of chewing your drink (minced mint), I would steer clear of this. It didn't become much of an issue, but I was careful every time I took a sip that small chunks of mint didn't get caught in my throat.Service was great and food comes out of the kitchen very fast so we were in and out in about an hour. We left when happy hour ended and there were quite a few parties waiting for a table.
5	The food and sparkling sangria are amazing! Stuffed dates, sliders, fries, baked cheese with chorizo, pretty much everything. Small plates so bring other people and order a lot to share. Even the bread and butter they bring out it good. The only thing I had there that I didn't like was a spinach salad. Go figure. The only other downside is the long wait and cramped atmosphere, but it is worth it. Go for happy hour, not as busy and have price drinks, even pitchers.
4	Went here based on the yelp reviews and yes because I saw it on tv.   We pretty much ordered what the other yelpers said were must haves and a couple of things to our tasting. Everything was very flavorful and decent portions considering they are tapas and supposed to be small plates.  We ordered the stuffed dates which was the smallest portion and after one bite you know why, they were really rich and sweet, this was not my favorite thing and probably will not order this again. We also ordered the filet mignon sliders (yummy),the firefly fries (a must), steamed mussels (I think we should have ordered the clams instead), and the calamari ( fresh but the star was the dipping sauce). My only complaint was the sangria, it tasted watered down and didn't include any fruit which I think is a must with sangria. Overall a very cool place to hit away from the strip.
5	There's nothing to say about Firefly that others haven't already said but I'd like to offer up a few thoughts.  For one, it's gotta to be one of my favorite restaurants to be at in Vegas.  The ambiance, the aura, and the sangria/cocktails (definitely a struggling AA members nightmare), are awesome.  Secondly, I love how fast the food comes to the table when you order something.  I like things done lightning fast so I was surprised with the 21-service rating in Zagat.  I'd have thought is would have been around 23-24.  The food rating is where it's at though 24 sounds just about right.  What I love most about Firefly though is how reasonable their prices are.Here's a listing at our recent visit:Pitcher Sangria - $28Boquerones - $5.50Beet Salad - $5.50Dates - $4Pulpo Asado - $7.50Steamed Mussels - $8Empanada - $4.50Crispy Duck Roll - $6Babyback Ribs - $9.50Lamb Chops - $8.50Paella - $20Not all of what we ordered was good.  But, all-in-all, NICE!  My favorites were the Empanada, Steamed Mussels, and Babyback Ribs.  Pretty decent dishes were the Boquerones (anchovies), Crispy Duck Roll (just the duck itself), and the Paella (although I can make a better paella with my eyes closed...paella is the only thing I can cook though).You can't do Vegas without a visit to Firefly for some quality food at reasonable prices!
4	I adore Firefly, but you all have to admit that this location is getting a little worn around the edges.  The place is dark but not so dark that I can't see the holes in the couches.  Still, the tapas and sangria are great.  I think the bacon-wrapped dates taste better at this location, although it could be that I always tend to be drunker at this location.The sangria is a little ice intensive when you get it by the pitcher, which is fine.  But usually I end up with a ton of ice and a tiny bit of sangria.  I take one sip and my glass is empty and my co-workers think I am a lush.  Occasionally, they use a cocktail strainer to pour the sangria from the pitcher but they aren't consistent about that and I really wish they would be.  There is only so much ice I need.I have fond memories from this location and I love the food but I think this location needs a bit of an overhaul.
4	Dined here on a Sunday afternoon on 11/27/11 for my husband's birthday lunch.  He originally was in the mood for burgers and fries and as we were driving down the road I spotted this place and remembered it was the many restaurants I bookmarked on YELP.  :)  Service was pretty fast, and friendly.  They were not busy at all, so it may be best to come here on Sunday afternoons if you want to avoid the crowds.  We ordered the following items:  Firefly fries (my hubby was craving fries), Firefly fish sticks, Filet Mignon sliders and ceviche.  Yes, I know these are weird items to order at a tapas place, but let me tell you everything was really delicious!!!  We really enjoyed the fries and fish sticks and the dipping sauces that came with them.  For dessert we had the passion fruit cheesecake and tres leches chocolate cake.  The passion fruit cheesecake was too tart for my liking, but the tres leches cake was very good.  We will definitely be coming back here again, and trying something new.  :)
4	Great place for dates!  Smooth atmosphere, reasonably priced, and the food is great.  Firefly is the only place I go for Tapas in Vegas.
5	I can't say enough good things about Firefly. I have been there for New Year's Eve, dinners with friends, drinks after work, and nights out.  Everything on the menu is delicious!  I have never had a bad meal. The sangria is the best I have ever had.  My favorite tapa is probably the bacon wrapped dates, but they are all delicious.
3	For what it is, Firefly works. The concept is great, and the quality of their product was high.HOWEVER, If I am hungry, I will probably pass on heading Fireflys way. I absolutely loved the dishes I had. The potatoes were awesome, and the grilled shrimp hit the spot. But ladies and gentlemen, I am 6' 220 lbs. I could easily spend $100 on my own mixing and matching these tiny plates. The service was alright, although my friends who come here often tell me it is sometimes shakey. I will definately be back for some drinks, but never on an empty stomach!!
5	At first I was quite hesitant about this place since I am from California and not familiar with places to eat in Las Vegas.  However, after eating at this place, I am definitely coming back to eat there the next time I visit.  The food was superb!  I ate here in a group of 15 people.  The bill was quite expensive for our group, so that may be something you want to consider if you plan on having more than just a few friends out with you.  Even though it was very pricy, the food was phenomenal.  They serve small portions, but you savor every bite.  The sangria was good as well.  Service was very fast and the environment was so enjoyable we ended up staying there for well over two hours.  The wait to get in since we didn't have reservations was easily thirty minutes, and the waiting area was so packed we had to wait outside (it was around 10 PM).  This place is worth at least one visit if not more than that.
4	I'd say out of the 5 to 6 times I've been here only once have I had a bad experience where both the food and service struggled to shine. Like many incredibly busy restaurants hey begin to falter when the tickets start to roll and stampede in during peak hours, but for the most part I've only had pleasurable memories when dining at Firefly. Its great for those that are on that baller on a budget as well as bringing a group of friends looking to lightly pre-game and/or fill up before a night of revelry. The stuffed dates, live, fun, causal atmosphere always does it for me. I'm due for a visit soon.Don't forget to grab that pitcher of sangria for more laughs and good times.
4	LOVE this place. I always go here when I visit Vegas. Its a very cute place and definitely very happening at all hours. They have plenty of tables and can easily accompany a large party. its dimly lit in the evening which makes it both fun and romantic. They also serve delicious pitchers of sangria. portions are slightly larger than I'm used to for tapas (which is a plus for us anyway). I think every item on the menu is equally delicious. Ok now for the food breakdown, please forgive me if I'm off in titling the food items...-Steamed mussels- one of my favorites here! Its a generous serving of mussels in what seems like a thai like curry sauce. -Lobster escargot- lobster pieces served in a garlic butter sauce, a must try for sure-Charizo clams- serviced in a great and very light sauce, i think its white wine and something else-ham and cheese croquets- i know it sounds boring and lame, but they make it really well!!-lamb skewers- not overly cooked, served on a bed of lentils-Apple and manchego salad- strips of apple and manchego cheese. sounds odd but they go very nicely together-Tuna tartare- diced cubes of raw tuna with avocado served with taro chips. The taro chips are very nice and lightBaked filets of tilapia- good, but doesn't stand out against the other dishes. The sauce is very simpleCamarones a la diabla- grilled shrimp in a nice spicy chile sauce. LOVE this dish
5	Great atmosphere...great meal...there is something for everybody!  Prices are very reasonable, you get a lot of food for the price you pay.  The drinks have a heavy pour...well worth the visit to any of the locations in Vegas!
4	Couple of my friends who lives in Vegas highly this tapa restaurant.So we just flew in late night, I'm thinking this will be a perfect place for late night snack.  So my husband and I went to this very cool restaurant around 11ish pm.  They got some sofa area, very casual plus some latino music.  It's a very nice place for hanging out with friends for dinner or party.My top 2 choices are tuna tartare and stuffed dates.  I usually don't like to eat dates, but they made very decilous.  They use almond to replace the seend which is very neat and the bacon wraped around the sweet dates.  Very nice!I also tried Filet Mignon, Terra y Mare Skewer, Manchego Mac and Cheese.  They are not bad.  I will definitely come back again with my friend.  She said I gotta try the mussels the next time :)
5	For all the fanfare, the location was a little hard for me. Using a map app on my phone, I thought it was a short hop-skip-and-a-jump from UNLV. Boy, was I wrong--those are some huge blocks--and it was cold, windy and rainy. By the time I saw Firefly, it was like a safe haven after trekking in the wilderness of Vegas streets or something. I entered into the dark, reddish lights, seeing mostly couples and small groups of friends, so I sat alone in my corner, ready to feast!Also, when you sit, they bring you a plate of olives, bread, and garlic butter, which is a plus.Red Sangria- 3 1/2-stars- Obviously, I made sure I arrived for Happy Hour. At first sip, the flavor was strong, but not potency in the alcoholic sense. Just the pure strength of red wine was awakening. Digging around in my glass with fruits, I did nibble out pieces of apply.Sparkling Sangria- 5-stars- If it's your first time, I'd surely suggest this first. It's definitely sweeter and lighter in flavor. I nibbled out some blueberry and apple pieces. As this was the second glass, I'm unsure if the effervescence made the alcohol hit faster or harder, but I felt a little happy after this glass.Stuffed Dates- 4 1/2-stars- You receive four dates per plate. The dates are bacon-wrapped, with smoked almonds, a red wine reduction sauce, and crumbled bits of bleu cheese. The bacon explodes with juiciness. Just underneath, the dates crunch lightly with their sweet and creamy texture. I'll admit the dish turned out a bit too oily for me--whenever I can feel a thick oiliness on my lips, I get uncomfortable. The bleu cheese adds a depth of sharp and earthy surprise, which is a good things, because it keeps your senses alive. Definitely a good choice of date or bacon, or just plain flavor lovers.  Lamb Skewers- 4-stars- You receive two skewers per plate. All I can say is that the aroma hits you immediately, which is a potent mix of all the ingredients. Definitely an interesting surprise. Your plate includes leg of lamb, mushrooms, red bell peppers, red wine sauce and lentils. The red peppers add a level of fresh, sweet flavor between each piece of lamb, well marinated with the red wine. Each skewer has about 3-4 huge chunks of juicy, cooked lamb--some pieces very tender, other very chewy. The overall flavor is earthy and delicious, I am definitely a fan of lamb. The bed of lentils is very interesting, as it seems to have captured the drippings and all the flavors and juices. Even if you don't want to eat it, you should taste a spoonful.Atmosphere-- There are more secluded side areas, and then a larger space with windows letting white daylight in. I say this, because the rest of the establishment had a muted red tone to it. There is a beautifully arranged bar in the corner, next to their kitchens. The decor is nice, relaxing, yet artistic, with even a fish tank above the entry way. The music is a little loud, so people are also talking louder to compensate. There is also a television next to the bar for people who have no one to talk to.Service- Although I was greeted by one person and taken to a table, I found myself helped by a half-dozen different people. One person I ordered a sangria from, another person I ordered my meal, and someone else came to deliver my different plates. At least I didn't need to worry about who to ask for help--anyone passing by was fine, because they all asked how I was doing. At least your glass will never be empty here.Conclusion- As a visitor, the location made it almost too 'locals-only', especially since the bus back to the strip was in a deserted business area. I'd definitely eat and run before the sun sets early. The look and feel of the place is great. There are dozens of tapas to pick from, it's just too bad I had eaten a few hours beforehand, and had to meet a friend on the Strip for dinner. The food is also awesome. Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area or have a car, I wouldn't bus it.
4	Great fun with darn good food.  Night crowd is full of eye candy too!  Good drinks.
5	I've been here twice now, and I'll be back again! I love the atmosphere, I love the food, and the service is good too. I like being able to try a little bit of everything, and then washing it down with some sangria! There was not one thing that I would not order again, it's all good! While there may not be a lot of restaurants that feature tapas, this one is definitely on top - and it's good to be #1, even if it's a short list.I feel like a lot of the off-strip places get overlooked in Vegas, but this place deserves some of the spotlight - which is pretty impressive considering it's in one of the food capitals of the world. If you want something in between the super fancy restaurants and the food courts in Vegas, this place is a must-try!
4	I love firefly...Best Tapas in Vegas. Food is reasonably priced and so are the drinks. Don't forget to try the Sangria., and don't let the strip mall fool you either. The vibe inside the restaurant is always fun and hip with a lot of younger crowd. I have probably been to Firefly more than any other restaurant in town.
4	If you want to get off the Vegas strip for some tapas dining, I highly recommend this place. Fun and vibrant place that fills up. All the tapas are great and the Sangria makes is good as well.
5	This is one of the best restaurant that i ever visited in Las Vegas.  The place is not hard to find and the atmosphere is great, came here during Christmas eve and the people is so welcoming.The food was delicious, it is appetizer style and encouraging us to order wine to cope with the food.Pros: great price, great food, great service, and great decorCons: wine is fine but not great, bread is free but is cold upon delivered, table were ruined and bouncy.Another thought: will visit this place again, great for dating or family or friends!
2	Food was ok and service was really bad.We went there for the Christmas Eve dinner. We made the reservation at 11pm via OpenTable which shows that they have reservation available at 11 or 11:30. However after we arrived the waitress said they will close at 12. We decided to just eat very fast which turned out to be a really bad idea because during the dinner the wait staff were really impatient and rude.Most of the food were also not as good as the other yelp reviewers said...although I am not sure if it was because it was the Christmas Eve.
5	There's so many extensive reviews already I don't need to write another, just want to add that this is my favorite place to eat in all of Las Vegas!  You might wait a while to get in but it's worth it.Don't miss the filet sliders or infused vodka martini, but don't try to stand up too quickly after more than one!
5	I made a Yelp account just so I could review this place. I think the food was AMAZING! This place is definitely one of my favorite parts of Las Vegas.I had the Veggie Empanadas, Apple Manchengo Salad and the Tomato Basil Soup and they were all delicious. I also tried my friends' stuffed peppers, veggies and lentils and fish sticks and lentils, and they all tasted so, so good. My favorite dish was probably the Veggie Empanadas, but I loved them all.The service was really good too. The servers came by our table very frequently to make sure everything was going okay. Ours even split our check for us and cracked a few jokes as we ate. The atmosphere was also nice. Good music, dim lighting with candles scattered about, friendly people, a bar, etc. It was all nice.Upon leaving the restaurant, my friends and I made a pact. We will one day eat at Firefly again. Whether or not we visit the Vegas strip again is still uncertain...but we will go to Firefly.If you're in town, you MUST check out Firefly. I loved it! :)
5	Didn't try one thing I didn't love!!!We attempted to eat dinner here for my bday which was a Friday & we waited to go till 9:30 which was a mistake... lol. They were packed. Bar area had tons of people standing all around it. Entrance going in was so packed you could barely get to hostess stand. Very low lighting. Reminded me of nightclub atmosphere, lol. So given all this & us being locals we decided we would come back another day during happy hour because we were way too hungry to wait. So we went the folowing Friday around 4, during Happy Hour. Got seated & served water immediately :) House made White Sangria was tastey although I think I will have  to try the red next time.We tried 5 diff tapas & they were all amazing. Pork empanadas, calamari, chx salad, ham & chz croquotte, filet mignon sliders. LOVED them all.The bread & butter they give you is also very good. The butter is sweet & has some kind of ground up nuts in it I believe.
4	Love this place been going for YEARS and it's always consistent. Great food great drinks and good service. Can never go wrong. Love the stuffed peppers!
4	Very nice food choices! I had their lamp chop, beef, mussels and clams. Clams weren't too great because they were way too small and some had sands in them. Mussel were small too but they were fresh and prefectly cooked.Their "full bar" wasn't full at all, they didn't have my favorite Macallan 12; their red wine selection seemed to be a lot more nicer though - one star off. A very nice place to go if you arriving Las Vegas late, they open till 2am.
5	One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!! The food is always delicious, the atmosphere is always warm, and the Sangria is delicious.
5	This place is delicious! We dined here with a party of six so we were able to sample a lot of of different dishes. The favorites were the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese (need I say more?), the tuna tartare, and flash fried peppers. We also had the filet mignon sliders, the stuffed mushrooms, and grilled shrimp. It was all very good. We also shared a carafe of sangria, although some in our group did not like the sangria, so we also ordered a bottle of wine. We did not have room for dessert, so I will have to go back for that. And the price was right, I think our bill was $200 for 6 of us!
4	Every bite was delicious!  You can't go wrong here.  Servers were friendly and helpful.  They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel on the strip after the meal.  Definitely worth trying if you're visiting the area.  Don't forget to save room for dessert!
5	The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat.
4	This spot is where you bring the ladies to on a first date fellas!!!!  Get them a glass of Sangria and some  bacon wrapped dates and they are all yours! HA! Love this place,,,,,i bring all my ladies here
5	Great experience. We had a group of 25. So, automatically that would be a change for most restaurants. In addition our dinner was the same time as day one of the CES Tradeshow. Consindering this Tradeshow is the largest in Vegas and the close proximaty of the convention center we could have been in for a chalenge. Even with the situation at hand. The restaurant did an amazing job. Service was fast and friendly. Food was great taisting and timely. If you are new to this restaurant then:TAPAS styleHip dark atmosphere $20 to $50 a person pending appetite. Very close to the strip. Most locals and tourists have it in their dining rotation. They are Especially known for their sangria.
5	I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! We come to Firefly at least once a month for tapas and drinks. Firefly is a great spot for HH or a quick glass of sangria as a pre-game before heading out for the night. The food is consistently delicious and the white sangria is my favorite. And if you're craving something sweet the banana and nutella sandwiches hit the spot. Some of my favorite tapas are:-thai beef salad-shrimp diablo-stuffed dates with bacon-lamb skewers-musselsThe paradise location can get super packed and I think I actually prefer the lay out of the bar area of the Sahara location. It's much less cramped.
5	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  The bacon-wrapped dates are a MUST as well as the fruit and cheese plate for dessert.  Awesome sangria (the white is my fave) and a fun, casual atmosphere.  Super friendly staff and a great way to try a bunch of different dishes.  Super reasonable prices and the food comes out insanely quickly!  Love, love love!
5	The most amazing place I have eaten at. It was based on small portions ( tapas), but they didn't skimp you in flavor,amount, or the price. The service was excellent! Except for the hostess's they were a little snotty, but we didn't care our servers were wonderful and the bussers were so efficient and fast! We were visiting Vegas and ate there twice within our stay! Thank you we will be back!
5	Delicious food + excellent service = great experienceVery big selection of various tapas - hot, cold, seafood - lots to chose from. Bacon-wrapped figs, shrimp in spicy sauce, chorizo-chicken stuffed mushrooms, thai-style ginger salad, baby beets salad, stuffed peppers, tetilla cheese fondue - everything was outright delicious. Also don't miss on Sangria - made at a restaurant with red, white and sparkling wines - not too sweet and just with the right balance of fruit and sugar - very tasty. Great prices.Also have to commend the service - our waitress Sandy was very friendly and helpful, all the food came out promptly and at a write temperature. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.Highly recommended.
5	Thanks Yelp!Once again, we have found a restaurant that we would not have visited if we would only have followed the tourist information in an unknown city.When we were in Vegas last week, we checked Yelp for restaurants close to the Hard Rock Hotel, where we stayed. Firefly on Paradise had such exceptionally good reviews that we decided to try it... And we were not disappointed.Greeted by a very friendly waiter with the funkiest hairstyle (a leopard-Mohawk combination that rocks!), we were seated immediately at a very nice table by the window.Following other reviews, we tried the sparkling sangria (usually I always go for red one, but omg, this is delicious!). It had blueberries, apples and pears which we picked out - awesome.We were pretty hungry, so we decided to go with 3 Tapas each. For European standards, that would be the minimum, here you get ore American-sized Tapas, and we were stuffed after 3 per person.We had the Apple Manchego Salad (which I copy at home now, it's so simple yet so good), the veggie empanada (yumm), the pulpo asado (great fresh pulpo with a nice sauce), the Thai beef salad (pretty large tapa, very good), the merguez ( you get two sausages, nicely spicy), and of course we had to try the dates (my family lives in Spain, and we had a lot of bacon-wrapped dates there - Firefly dates are even better!).We decided we had to try the desserts after those tapas, so we went with chocolate cakes tres leches and the bread pudding. Again, the presentation is mouthwatering, and the taste simply exquisite.It's a shame we don't live here, otherwise I'd be a regular. Make sure to try out this tapas restaurant when you're in Vegas, especially if you stay in the Hard Rock Hotel or closeby - it's just a little walk away!
5	Incredible food at great value.  Terrific sangria and a massive selection of tapas that includes some real winners.  Highly recommended.
3	Came here as a group of 4 on a saturday afternoon after finding this place on yelp and looking at the menu.  I must admit that it is one of the cheaper tapas restaurant that I've heard of.Pros: Service was good with waitresses and waters constantly checking on us. Many different tapas to choose from including some unique ones that I had never heard of Cons: Flavor of tapas is nothing special.  I feel like other tapas places may have smaller portions but at least they are more flavorful and authentic...We ordered the paella which was absolutely TERRIBLE!  no hint of saffron, really mushy rice...I felt bad because my friends have never had paella before.  I suppose its good to set the bar lowSangria isnt worth it...there was too much ICE despite the fact that I asked for light ice and the waiter responded "of course" Its $7 a glass and $28 a  pitcher...if a pitcher comes out to ~4 glasses full of ice...why not just order 4 glasses. If you're contemplating ordering the pitcher because its a better deal...don't bother.  its not.The waiter also forgot to put in our beef skewer order which resulted in another 10 minute wait after all the food was cleared off the table....
5	Tapas....appetizers....pupus.....that's the definition.  everything on their menus are like this...tasty small plates and most are between $5-8.  Found out via other Yelpers! recommendations while going to the CES convention.  About a mile or so off the strip; the parking lot is small so car pool, taxi, or good luck trying out the lot....but it's well worth it.  I had the pork ribs, chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped almonds?, beef/mushroom skewers.....If you are a fan of Sangrias....order a pitcher!Make reservations or come early! I got there at 6 PM and a line was starting to form.
2	The food is alright and the service is ok. However , I think this place is over rated. The lighting is dim, which can be romantic, and the decor is quaint. Firefly has good ambiance and it can be nice place to take a date.Just make sure its not on a busy night, because the seating in the dining room is very close together. On a busy Friday night, our set of 3 felt like we were at an awkward dinner party where only small groups were allowed to face each other at a particular time. It was like if we turned our head at any moment we would be part of a different group and/or conversation.  If you dare order a pitcher of Sangria or anything else please say "no ice". I swear I paid $28 for a 2lbs bag of ice in a mug with a splash of Sangria........very disappointing. I would not go as far as to say I won't ever eat there again,...... but I will not be the one paying for the meal or for the wild horses it will take to drag me there either!
4	Good food not overly priced.
4	Great food. Especially the Paella. Everything was just a tad pricey, but the atmosphere was good (lounge-type) and the Sangria was excellent. According to one member of our party, the mojito was amazing. Late night eateries are obviously common in Sin City, but not many are upscale like this.
4	Great place for Tapas.  Try the regular Mojito, it's the Bomb.  No need to get the pitcher as it works out to the same as buying individual mojitos & they have a tendency to knock you on your butt.  The food has never disappointed, the sauce that comes with the Firefly fries is so good I could DRINK it!  The service is good, but not "stellar" which is my criteria for 5 stars.It gets packed on weekends, so beware!Don't pass this one up!
4	3 stars for the taste of food, 4 stars for lively atmosphere.I love small plates of food because you have many options and many different flavors. Although I was eating different items, I could not find a dish that was so stellar that  I yearned for when I lie in bed. My tastebuds weren't on fire but I was OK with that because I was having a lot of fun catching up with my friends who were vacationing from California. We were chatting and picking at food and when we got thirsty we had a gulp of sangria and went back to chatting and picking at food. In the end, we ate and drank everything. I think this is a great place to hang out, eat a little to hold you over for dinner, and loosen up for the night ahead. So don't expect an excellent meal here but do expect to have a good time with your buddies!
5	Every time I roll through Vegas, this place is a MUST visit! The atmosphere is awesome, with a young crowd and good vibes all around.  The food is reasonably priced and everything I have tried is amazing.  I'm especially a fan of the lobster escargot, the filet mignon sliders, the ahi tartar and the stuffed mushrooms.  I can't wait until I come back so I can eat here again!
4	Food was fabulous and the sangria was the best I've ever had!! The ambiance brings it all together :) Wonderful find outside of the strip.Attended March of 2010, 2 years later and I still remember the experience and will definitely return in fact we already have reservations for banquet service for our upcoming trip back to Vegas.Bottom line: highly recommend, you have to definitely try this place out.
3	Came here based on a recommendation from a co-worker and yelp review.  Showed up as a solo on a early Friday night.  Food was excellent, service was just as good.  Both the waitress (Irina) and the supporting staff were friendly and very attentive.  Had such an excellent experience that I decided to go for lunch on Saturday afternoon.  I was seated promptly on one of their couches...and proceeded to sit there unnoticed for five plus minutes.  The hostess who sat me finally noticed that no one had come over to check on me so she promptly brought me a plate of their bread/olives.  Another ten minutes passed still no one to welcome me or take my drink order.  Fifteen plus minutes is more than I can bear.  As great as my experience was on Friday, I definitely experienced the complete opposite Saturday.
5	My whole family went there for 'something different" and we will be back!Gourmet quality tapas, great for sharing!   The plates look small, but you wouldn't believe that it can fill you up!  Almost everything was gourmet quality, enticing presentation, and top notch in flavor.Their signature dish is the stuffed dates, and they were to die for!  One of the best things I've ever eaten in LV.! Our only disappointment was the duck.  It wasn't bad, just not that good.Our group of 4 hungry people was there on a Friday night, and even though we ordered booze and some of the more pricey items on the menu (including lobster), our bill managed to stay @ $110.The only complaint from our table is that they don't have a location in Pasadena (yet), where my family were visiting from..
5	best food ever and great staff had my first meal there on monday  loved it so much went back on wednesday with my friend
5	I love this place! I've come here for tapas for years now and still love it. Bravo!
5	This lil gem is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. It's amazing how tasty and well priced the food is! We ordered many tapas for our dinner.Calamarai-- ok I've had betterChicken Salad- definitely refreshingApple and Manchego Salad- delish!Lamb Chops- AmazingPaella-  THE BEST DISH there (in my opinion), omg, it was soo good!!! Stuffed Dates-- fiance said it was the worse dish all night, I didn't try it. lolThe sparkling sangria was also delicious and refreshing.I've never been to such a well priced, great tasting tapas restaurant. I'm definitely going to come back!!
4	Great food, fast and pleasant service! will definitely be going back! perfect for a date night or a double date
5	I absolutely adored this place. I love the tapas concept because I get to try a little bit of everything. I won't say much because I know it's already been said, but I highly recommend this place. The food was flavorful, creative and fun. The sangria was awesome and the prices were fair. The service was great. My favorite part was the bacon wrapped figs. It was a refreshing combination of flavors. It was like eating bacon candy!
4	I love this place, great food with nice decor.  We ordered probably 10 tapas plus Paella.  The Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Camarones A La Diabla, Mushroom Tart...everything we ordered were  delicious.  Their Sangria was also pretty amazing.  I also feel fresh since it is off the strip, not those typical casino restaurants.  I will definitely go back to try more different dishes.
5	Coming here on a Friday night for dinner is a bad idea if you're hungry cuz the wait is an hour at least. BUT, so worth the wait cuz you can wait in the bar area and drink up their mojitos =) Which I love more than their infamous sangria!By the time you get your name called, you'll be 3 pitchers/canters in of the stuff. Passion fruit is prolly my favorite and Paradise is my least.
4	For our sixth date what an atmosphere :) Lilly and I needed girls night out!! Everything from the music to the food to the table candles was wonderful!! The server was friendly and the food came in great time and tasted great!! :) We would return to firefly before looking for a new hot spot! :) Xo
5	From the outside: unassuming strip mall. From the inside, hip loungey restaurant and bar that looks upscale, but has great prices. Can't say enough good about Firefly - I was very impressed. The food was so incredibly delicious. My boyfriend and I split the following: the apple and manchego salas, the stuffed dates, the artichoke hearts and the tierra y mar skewers, tuna tartar, and cerviche. Tapas were just the right amount of food - not too much, and not too little. Great date night spot, spot to meet with your friends, or just a place to unwind after work. Great service, too.
5	I love Firefly, one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Design: 5/5 the place has dimmed lighting with ruby red lighting, very vintage. Great ambiance*what I USUALLY order & what YOU should order*Camarones Al Ajillo: 5/5 Is shrimp in this lemon butter sauce with slices of bread. When your eating it I suggest dipping the bread and letting it soak in the butter sauce. My favorite dish!Steak and Mushroom Skewers: 5/5 yummm its a roasted filet in a creamy garlic sauce. The sauce is a perfect add on dipping sauce for the steak. Compliments the filet's roasted flavor. Sangria (a pitcher): 5/5 Trust me best Sangria in town, 1 glass won't be enough. Even if your with a group of friends I usually can down 2-3 glasses myself because its so delicious. Its not acidic and it tastes like juice with a hint of EXCITEMENT  Service: 4/5 The hostess are very sweet, there's usually a wait. The door ways kind of small and hard to maneuver around because there's usually a lot people packed in that small area. The servers are really nice and attentive. Happy Hour: 5/5 I absolutely love their happy hour, I definitely take a late lunch when ever possible.  its 50% off All Drinks from 3-6pm mon-thur and fridays 3-5 Can't beat that!
3	Dudes, yall have been letting me down with your soggy fries, lukewarm food and piss poor service the past few visits.. Your sangria, bacon wrapped dates, and sexy, casual vibe is your only saving grace.I need to find a new spot to bring visitors. Thanks.
5	Update Time! Went here for the 3rd time, in as many years. There is always a wait as the secret about these guys has gotten out over the last several years. It is worth the wait! They are still my #1 goto-spot for Vegas. Sneaked out of here under $50 for 2 people! The infused Vodka Martini was the winner of the night. Never had a fruity martini that was so well balanced and not too sweet. Other highlights include the eggplant canneloni & lamb chops. I was sad that we were swayed away from the garlic shrimp which everyone raves about but, I'll be back!
5	I've visited Firefly on a few occasions and am only reviewing now....bad yelper.  Hubby surprised me by taking me here for a quick early dinner before opera rehearsal and it was a welcome diversion.  We shared a red wine sangria, tuna peppers (tuna salad stuffed into wee red peppers; lovely bright flavour), sausage plate, tortilla a la espanola, filet mignon sliders (2 lovely little baby burgers with plenty of cheese), and albondigas (meatballs in a very yummy sherry tomato sauce).  It's so easy to overeat here, because each selection seems so darn small (what?  Only 4 meatballs?? only 2 sliders?), but after trying a few things, your tummy definitely says stop.  Had to have dessert -- i AM a girl -- and chose the chocolate tres leches cake.  Gah, so good.  Delectable.All hot items were hot, all cold items were cold, and service was pretty decent.  This place fills up fast, so don't come here with a strict timeline.  Atmosphere is trendy, young, chic, which can translate as "low lighting and close quarters," but also interpreted as intimate and cozy.  :)
5	I was on a trip from philly to Vegas and we just saw Motley Crue at the Joint. We wanted something to eat, and wanted to hang out for some drinks as well. Firefly did an outstanding job of serving up both items. Had Lamb Skewers, Calamari, Octopus, and some short ribs....everything was killer....i think we had some other dishes which i can't recall, probably due to the awesome pitcher of sangria that we had.  The Sangria is some of the best that i have had, and it's only 25 bucks...thats 2 beers at a club. Back at home I'm wishing that there was a Firefly in Philly.
4	I came to Firefly before the drive back to San Diego on a Sunday evening.  We had a group of 9 but got seated promptly at around 7pm.  There are two rooms to the restaurant so it's larger than you think.I've only had tapas once before, but the general rule seems to be an average of 2 plates per person if you're not big eaters.  With a large group, its always hard to share small dishes so we split into smaller groups for sharing.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for 3 people.  Recap: Sangria was good.  The lobster escargot is presented in the same manner as escargot - extremely buttery and delicious.  Tuna tartare was really average - similar to all other tuna tartare can get at other restaurants, imo.  We had some other dishes too but nothing really stood out in my mind.  My absolute favorite is the manchego mac and cheese.  I love mac and cheese.  I've never had manchego cheese, but now I also love manchego cheese.  This mac and cheese is on the cheesier side compared to most I've had so you really gotta love cheese for this.  The dish is small but it is so rich that each person really only needs a small amount to be satisfied.  The baked crust on top was perfect.Definitely worth giving this place a try, especially if you're sick of eating the overpriced food on the strip or buffets.
4	The gf never been and wanted to try this place and for so long, I kept saying it's overrated as I've been quite a few times and it was very average at best.  So last week, felt like hanging out more than eating so decided to take her to a great hang out spot: yup, Firefly, where there's always a nice crowd.Surprise, surprise. Since I was the veteran, I ordered the mojito, bacon wrapped dates, the lobster escargot, and the Ribeye with Firefly fries. All of it was not bad at all.The knock was for the lobster escargot. When it came out, I thought the server had served us someone's leftover by mistake but to our surprise, that's it. Picture about 6 little lumps the size of m&m's if not smaller served in a garlic plate.  True story, after eating about 2 little lumps, the busser came by and asked if we were done with the dish, and I looked at him and he looked at me and realized that we had just started on the dish. Despite this little awkwardness, the service was excellent. I will be coming back more often.Note: I always hear that Firefly is cheap. It's not. The menu price is deceiving because the portions are SO small that I've never walked out of that place for less than $50 for 2 despite usually not even drinking alcohol.
5	Visiting for the weekend and found I Yelp. This place is off the chart good AND a great value. Sat at the adjacent bar to avoid wait. Greg the bartender saw to our every need, his recommendations were all the best and he makes a mean drink. Not fond of Sangria but theirs is the best. Bacon wrapped dates, skewers of fillet and mushroom, mussels, shrimp, lamb..,.,,,  Will always eat her every time I come to Vegas in the future
4	Pretty great with great prices
4	Firefly has been on my list for a couple years now.  Last night, I finally made it.  I love the intimate decor of this place after dark.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  By the time we left, the place was mobbed!  We ordered several plates.Pulpo Asado:  mm-mm-mm, good!  the octopus was grilled to perfection.Warm Spinach Salad:  Excellent!  I loved the vinaigrette that was tossed with this salad and the pine nuts were crunchy and fresh.  I cannot stand stale nuts.Potatas Bravas:  a bit burnt with a crisp which I loved.Firefly Fries:  I could have eaten several plates of this and could have sipped the aioli with a straw.  My goodness.Baked Tilapia:  a delight.  Tilapia is not my favorite fish, but at FF it is.Meatballs in Tomato Sherry Sauce:  Okay, not a highlight.Gelato Trio:  Chocolate - check, vanilla - check, pistachio - ehhhh.  But that is a personal thing.  I don't like pistachio.Overall, a great first experience at FF.  I'll be back.
5	Whenever I come to Vegas, I always look for good food. Unfortunately, a lot of the food in Vegas are over priced and honestly not worth it at the inflated prices. Fortunately, the food off strip are super affordable and really good. And more and more, I find myself going off the strip for good food. Our weekend Vegas trip was coming to an end and our group wanted some good food but not too much since some of us were still hungover from the night before. We concluded that tapas was a great choice since we can order a lot of them and it came in small portions. Another good thing about eating at these places off the strip is that they aren't full of tourists so there's no hour waits. When we got here during lunch time, we had no line, no nothing. We were immediately seated and started ordering. My friends ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was a cure all for those with a hangover. Overly ambitious, we started ordering the tapas. The price ranged from 6-10$ and the servings for each dish served for 2-3 people. We ordered everything from the shrimp ceviche, firefly fries, filet sliders, grilled octopus, steamed mussels, steak & mushroom skewers and the bacon wrapped dates. Everything was delicious! The shrimp ceviche had the right amount of acid and freshness and the shrimps weren't over cooked. The fries were great and the garlic aioli was PERFECT. And thanks to the other yelper's recommendation of the bacon wrapped dates, those were to die for. The only complaint that I actually had were the grilled octopus. They were kind of overcooked so they were a lot chewier than I would prefer them to be. Overall, the service of this place is great and the setting is perfect for a tapas bar. If you want good, affordable food (especially after a weekend of gambling), you should really check out this local's joint for some GOOD with no wait.
5	I have been a Vegas regular for many years now. Growing a bit tired of my "on the strip" restaurant selections, I've been making it my goal to branch out.  I actually came across Firefly on Yelp and from the reviews was anxious to try it.  We ate here on 2/10/12 and...what can I say....the food was excellent, the prices were fair and the sangria was potent!!  I can't wait to go back and share this place with my family and friends.  One thing to remember - it's not like this place is a secret, you can tell it's a favorite of locals and tourists who ask around will hear about this restaurant.  It's incredibly busy and you will wait for a table - so, be sure to account for that when you are making you after-dinner plans.  Enjoy!
4	Firefly is a tapas restaurant that I'd happily welcome into my own neighborhood.  It serves moderately priced tapas off the strip.  It is obvious that this is a local gem whose value is probably overlooked as people flock to Michelin starred restaurants just blocks away.  We started with the blue cheese, bacon wrapped stuffed dates.  These were very roasty, the bacon was crisped almost too much but they were certainly crunchy.  I liked the added crunch of the smoked almond.  The red wine reduction was interesting.  It was a very thin sauce that struggled to cling onto the food.  Sweet date, rich cheese, crunchy pork fat, smoky almond, acidic sauce - it was nice. The chicken skewers were one of our favorite items.  I would have never ordered them because nothing sounds more boring to me than grilled chicken.  To my surprise, the chicken was well marinated and extremely flavorful.  I really liked the roasted tomato and the garlic cream sauce.  It was also a very generous serving with quite a few skewers. Another favorite was the pulpo asada.  The octopus had been marinated and grilled.  It was tender and smoky with enough chew to make you remember and appreciate what it is. There were some dishes that were less successful.  The manchego macaroni and cheese was not well-received.  It was heavy and greasy with puddles of oil across the top of the baking dish.  The baby back ribs with a mango bbq sauce were boiled tender but otherwise not really memorable.  The mango bbq sauce was not was surprisingly boring as I expected something sweeter, tangier, or more tropical perhaps.  The dessert, a chocolate tres leches had an identity crisis.  Itwas not as creamy and milky as a regular tres leches and not as rich as a normal chocolate dessert leaving it ho hum.  Even though I did not love every single dish, every single dish was solid and tasty.  The greatest selling point was perhaps the price and the value - good food accented by great food.
4	This place is not far at all from the strip, so people without cars can make the lil trek up here, too.Come during hh, when all drinks are half off from 3-5pm. I got the sparkling sangria for $3.50, which was sweet and tasty! The steak and mushroom skewers were super filling, loved how the mac n cheese came out hot and crispy, and those dates were unique. Btw I LOVED the bread with the almond butter (had about 8 or so slices of it!).We all only needed about one dish to get pretty full. Yummm I'll be back!
5	Firefly on Paradise, has the perfect combination when it comes to  food, ambiance and music.  Sitting outside on the patio was great to enjoy the fabulous Spring weather that we have been having.. As we are 'Vegan', Firefly always has a good choice for us. We ordered our favorite dishes.- Warm spinach salad (without feta cheese)- Patatas bravas (aioli sauce replaced with marinara sauce)Firefly is a great place to socialize.. 2 thumbs up!!
5	I love this place. I live right near it and always mean to hit it again. Finally went the other night again, and realized why it rocks! Excellent food the Tapas are amazing, none were bad. Also the bar is very cool and the service and drinks are good to go
5	Eat It OR Beat It?**EAT IT!!**BEST tapas I've tried. The pitcher of sangria (red and white) is very delicious! Normally, people who visit Vegas don't venture off the strip too much, but Firefly is a restaurant you must must visit! The dates wrapped in bacon is my personal favorite!Forget spending 3x the money at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills for snooty subpar tapas... try this place out! CONCLUSION:If you're tired of eating buffets and want to mix it up, I recommend coming to Firefly! The prices are very reasonable and the food is rich and full of flavor! So, I say, EAT IT!!!!!!!!!!
5	Inventive tapas, great drinks, solid service, and a swanky ambiance, make this a must every time I am in vegas.  Bacon wrapped dates that make my nipples hard, crispy duck rolls so good I peed a little bit.  Make reservations, or be ready to wait most nights, but well worth it.  Its one of those places you just cant go wrong with ordering ANYTHING...just try it
5	I've heard so much about Firefly from some locals, so I FINALLY had the opportunity to check this AAAMMAZZING place out. It definitely lives up to the hype and everyone's raving recommendations. I'm starting to think that I need to venture off the strip for better tasting food for cheaper prices.Ambiance:Firefly has an amazing vibe. It's dimly lit, quiet, and chill. I like how you can sit on couches as opposed to chairs. You can sit comfortably on the couches while you sip on some delicious sangrias.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?userid=0f_0XfO2qcgNwSJAHwfR9gFood:1) Filet Mignon Sliders - Sliders are always a safe bet. SOOOO GOOOOOOOODDD. The meat was tender and the caramelized onions, of course, are always welcome on a burgerhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=qUWwQJqRjOxq2kpOnK43hA2) Smoked Salmon Toasts - if you like the fresh salmon taste, this is definitely a must! capers, pickled red onions and dill sour cream were great on the smoked salmon. yummmmhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WCj5SXOvDukxgxMhv4lLVw3) Shrimp Ceviche - very fresh.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=Da3M9N2PDmtRd6QiH9azrQ4) Tuna Tartare - Didn't taste as fresh as the shrimp ceviche or the salmon, but it was still pretty dang good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=UlE5AF8h0VoL7UxC8CO8JQ5) STUFFED DATES were PERFECT! Even after reading all the reviews, I was still skeptical since I hate dates. However, I will ALWAYS order the dates here because they were bacon-wrapped and contained smoked almond, red wine reduction and blue cheese. The bacon combined with the almond, reduction, and reduction masked the flavor of the dates. Whatever they did, it WORKS.6) Firefly Fries - can't go wrong with parmesan, herbs, and garlic aioli on fries. Not too salty, but enough flavor and perfectly fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WLctqbU82YT1yw6nSKfLBQ7) Manchego Mac n' Cheese - I love mac n' cheese and it didn't disappoint here.8) Grilled octopus - FAIL. Overcooked and too chewy.Parking:Plenty of free parking in the strip mall parking lot. Not crazy like the strip.
5	Affordable, fast, and delicious tapas, it's one of my new fave spots to eat at in Vegas! They don't take reservations on weekends and we stopped in at around 5P for an early dinner and were seated right away. The fries, tuna tartar, and empanadas were a few of my faves. It's well worth the visit off the strip!
5	Eat it. Maybe. Skip it.EAT IT! Def.in.ite.ly.As a current resident in Seattle, I lived in the Henderson / Las Vegas area for 4 years. Firefly was my all time favorite place for drinks and tapas in LV. A great place to grab some food and drinks after work and/or to take my guests from that visited me from out of town.The staff was very friendly. The food was plentyful. The drinks were endless.The pitchers of passion fruit mojitos and the white wine sangria are the best thing to ever drink under the shade, alfresco, to beat that warm Las Vegas day heat, trust me. They are 10 out of 10 of the best refreshing drinks in the 702.... and the better yet, the best tapas I've had too date.My only mediocre critique: Firefly used to be a diamond in the rough. A locals paradise. But now I heard that sometimes it gets so busy that you have to make reservations... sad but also great for their business. I highly recommend this place to locals and visitors alike! This place will make you love the LV foodie seen and want to come back for more.
5	Fan.Tas.Tic. My friend who is a Yelp Elitist created a yelp restaurant list for us during our trip to Vegas the past weekend.  Although it is not on the strip, Firefly was still located in restaurant mecca where Lawry's is etc.  Our favorite dish of the evening was the LOBSTER ESCARGOT.  Had a very amazingly familiar taste (mmm, all that butter!).  Better yet, it was lobsters rather than snails!  It was excelo!Granted I had a four month old baby with me, I still had a great time.  There were times my baby cried, but the place was smashed with lots of people and a lot of noise, I or anyone around me couldn't even notice the sound of a crying baby.  Ambiance rocks with a dim pink lighting, reminding me of the atmosphere a firefly brings to a night sky. Fun setting for a group of friends! Maybe not so much for a romantic one on one date.
4	Mac and cheese is very good. Paella was a bit lacking. Firefly Fries were pretty delicious too. Roasted potatoes were a bit raw for my liking. Sweet n spicy shrimp tasted Chinese. I am aware that Rachael Ray has visited here, but despite that fact, the food was actually good. Ill return for mac and cheese from here ANYDAY.
4	As a vegetarian dragging a Spanish boy into a restaurant off the strip I was nervously skeptical. There were 9 of us dining and not one of us had a complaint about food, service, drinks or price. The tapas were larger than you would find in Spain, or so I was told, but aesthetically and pallately pleasing. The wines were delicious featuring popular Spanish, Argentinean, and Californian wines. We had pitchers of strong tasty sangria and mojitos and spent a solid three hours laughing and eating. I highly recommend this place to any one looking for a delish tapas bar in Las Vegas. The patatas bravas were under cooked inside, crispy on the outside and way too oily, but the artichoke appetizer is to DIE for. The service was prompt and friendly but some of our orders went to other tables and some other tables' food came to ours! Is that really a reason to dock them a whole star? No; but that and the lack of tiny tapas (showcasing the American need to have everything "bigger and better") are good reasons. Overall, I loved the experience and would gladly dine there again.
4	Of course, let me just preface this by saying that Firefly has always been and will continue to be my favorite tapas restaurant here in Vegas.  Tonight's experience however, didn't WOW me as others have in the past, for a few reasons:1. The hostess staff was, to say the least, inconsistent and a little rude.  Prior to our arrival, I called this location to possibly get a reservation set for two people, as they are always busy.  The hostess informed me that they aren't accepting reservations, however, there is NO wait and to just come on in.  When we got there 10 minutes later, the same young woman who answered my call informed me that there was a 20 minute wait.  Hungry at this point, I explained that I had called earlier to request a reservation to prevent this situation from happening.  I was rudely interrupted with a "that's correct, we are not taking reservations."  Giving this young lady the benefit of the doubt (and not wanting to make a scene), we then sat down on the chairs in front of the hostess podium.  It was shortly after that, where a group of 4 approach the podium and inform the hostess that they had a reservation tonight.  To my surprise, there was in fact, a reservation set for them!  I'm really glad, though, that my table for 2 was also ready at the very moment...2.  We ordered a lot of different tapas and drinks, as this was the first time my friend has been to Firefly.  Here are the Tapas ordered and my review for each:Red Wine Sangria-The taste is super potent, however, this is why I love their sangria.  What I look forward to, when it comes to their sangria, are the little chopped chunks of fruit floating in this drink.  The only thing floating in our pitcher tonight was ice.  What a disappointment.  Trust me though, that didn't stop us from finishing that pitcher.Stuffed Dates-C'mon!  Who doesn't love a bacon wrapped date, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese over a red wine reduction sauce.  Yum-o.  This dish has always been and always will be "on point" for me.  You get a salty taste, obviously from the bacon and blue cheese, combined with the sweetness from the dates.  This dish is "AH-MAZE-ING!"Firefly Fries-I honestly think I've these same fries at PT's Bar before.  Not as a dig to Firefly, but I think the aioli is what I think they use to distinguish this dish from other competition.  To me however, the aioli is their way of dressing up the word "mayonnaise," as that aioli is nothing but mayo.Comorones A La Diabla-One of my favorite tapas dishes at Firefly.  I think the simplicity of the dish makes it so enjoyable for me.  Shrimp sauteed in a sweet-spicy chile sauce and accompanied with grilled sliced bread to mop up the leftover sauce.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the grilled bread really helped me to clean off that plate.Lobster Escargots-I always love to commend restaurants for thinking outside the box and presenting dishes in a creative way.  Please know that the word escargots is accompanied with quotation marks because you're just eating lobster meat, prepared and presented to look like escargots.  In my personal opinion, I think it was just their way of serving less.  The dish didn't really make an impression.  Lobster meat in butter, garlic and herbs.  You'll get more for your money at Red Lobster.Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms-I love a good mushroom.  This dish really offered that to me, in terms of the mushroom being cooked perfectly.  Not too over cooked, not to undercooked.  What kind of killed the dish for me was the chicken and chorizo combo. It was ball of mushy dryness that ruined the overall dish for me.  Thank goodness the melted cheese on top was there! Crispy Duck Roll-In my eyes, probably the worse dish I've had at Firefly.  The Hoisin sauce was too tart, the duck was SUPER dry and grinded up, causing this really weird texture combination for me.  Not a good dish.  As a suggestion, maybe using chunks of dark meat, not grinded and searing the meat prior to stuffing the roll and deep frying.  Not "on point" at all.Lamb Skewers-Let me just say that when I started coming to Firefly 3 years ago, this has always been my number 1 favorite dish to order.  I love lamb, I love lentils and I love the combination of the two.  Tonight was no different.  This dish really makes my heart sing lol.  The seared, medium rare lamb meat skewered, on a bed of lentils, tomatoes and red wine reduction, really makes this dish soar to new heights.  This dish is truly, the reason why I keep coming back to this restaurant.Overall, my love for this restaurant will always supercede the love I have for other tapas restaurants.  Tonight's experience was mediocre at best, however, the reason for my 4 star rating is that Firefly's ambiance really shows me that this restaurant "gets it."  The vibe is very intimate, very chill, very hip.  It feels trendy, refined and chic.  I have been there many times and will continue to go there for years to come.
4	Every time me and my SO come out to Las Vegas, we try to make it a point to come out to firefly.The food is good and consistent, sangria is delicious, and service is stellar.Difficulty may be be met if you're trying to come here before hitting up the clubs on the strip due to crowds and timing so be sure to plan ahead.  Otherwise, I recommend coming here for lunch when service is a bit more tame and you have time to enjoy yourself without having to worry if you'll get back in time to get in the door somewhere else on the strip.Favorites of ours include the paella, terra y mare skewers, camarones a la diabla and of course the sangria.
4	This place was absolutely delicious! I loved everything I ordered especially the mushroom thing! it was soooo good!! Also, the sparkling sangria is really delicious as well.  My only thing against the place was that every time I go there's a loooooong wait, even when I call ahead. Nonetheless, i'll still continue to go :)
5	Super yummy tapas! Service was awesome and the food was good! Just wish I sampled their famous sangrias! One negative though! Please don't order their ahi tuna skewers! Regret!! Besides that! Stuffed dates live up to the hype and the pork empanadas are a must try! NOM!
5	Dimly lit restaurant and lounge. Couches. Candles. Hot hot sex. Dopest tapas place in Vegas and a well known local spot. Sangrias and Mojitos, fill em up. Have a yourself a good time. Hanging with friends or your lover, you're sure to have an intimate night.Skip the strip, come to Firefly. You'll thank me later.
5	Great local spot.  Filet sliders were great.  Croquetas perfect.  Went with a co-worker, portions were perfect for sharing, not too expensive.
5	We came here for a light lunch during the day , but I imagine the place would look pretty hip for a nighttime hangout with friends. My previous experience with Spanish tapas was pretty unremarkable... until I came to Firefly. I wasn't expecting much from bacon wrapped dates since I'm not a fan of bacon, but I was blown away by the unexpected sweet and crunchy flavor of the ones served here. They were like little bites of candy.  Bacon+ dates+ blue cheese+ almonds=genius! The empanadas were also delicioso but the paella was so-so here.
5	This place is awesome! Expect to come for a great time & delicious food & drinks. Weekends are always packed and there's always a waiting period. I recommend their happy hour in the late afternoon where it's slower and the sangria pitcher is half off!
4	I adore this place. It can be a little bit loud, especially later, but it's fun, it's delicious and it's quality! Order a pitcher of Sangria and dig in! Popular with locals & tourists - I bring all my friends here when they're visiting from out of town...MUST TRY: Banana & Nutella sandwich for dessert. Sooo good!
5	Firefly has definitely earned my business.  I can't wait to come back to Vegas to sample more of their delicious tapas.  The sangria was so tasty, I could have downed the entire pitcher by myself if my friends weren't looking.  The chef uses fresh, quality ingredients; you can see it reflected in the dishes.  The food was so good, we had to order a second order for most of them.  We sat at the bar and the waitress was so attentive and the food didn't take long to come out even though it was a packed house.  I've tried so many other restaurants in Vegas, 3 to 5 stars and all, some costing an arm and a leg and never have I left Vegas thinking about the food... But this time, WOW, Firefly definitely blew my socks off!!!  I was so impressed with the food and the price.  I will definitely be back!!
5	Fantastic food & service! We were in Vegas for my birthday and a co-worker recommended this place. Tapas and sangria were delish! Restaurant was busy when we arrived and our party of four was seated right away. Our sever Jesus greeted us right away and made some fantastic recommendations. We loved the mango barbecue ribs, crispy duck rolls, almond-bleu cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon (MUST TRY), tuna tartar, and some other really wonderful dishes. Prices were very reasonable, the food came out very quickly and our water glasses were never empty! Definitely will be back next time we are in town!
4	Have you ever glanced over a menu and had the urge to order practically everything, but resisted because you otherwise would have a plethora of to-go boxes to take home?  Well, thanks to small plate servings such as dim sum and tapas, adventurous foodies can now have their cake and eat (all of) it too!This past weekend, a few friends and I trekked over to Sin City to celebrate a dear friend's twenty-seventh birthday.  After checking into the Vdara Hotel (which is simply gorgeous in a minimal and contemporary fashion), we taxied off the Strip and arrived at Firefly to meet with some new friends for birthday dinner #1.  Since some of us skipped on breakfast and/or lunch, the ladies and I got a tad carried away with ordering.  But hey, we were planning on sharing.  And you know what they say, sharing is caring!Amongst the extensive tapas offered, our entire group of seven probably ordered about a quarter to a third of the list (there were so many plates in rotation during dinner that I might have forgotten an item or few.)*Tuna Tar tareSmoked Salmon Toast*Stuffed DatesSausage PlateThai Beef SaladStuffed Peppers*Manchego Mac N CheeseFried Calamari*Steamed MusselsLobster 'Escargots'*Ham & Cheese CroquetasSteak & Mushroom SkewersCrispy Duck RollPaella*Flavored Mojitos* = personal favorites Although all the plates were delicious, I had a few noteworthy items that I wanted to spotlight. Stuffed Dates: It's been a few days since our tapas dinner yet I can still taste the delicious flavors of the dates.  The bacon that wrapped around the date & bleu cheese was cooked perfectly - slightly crispy but still chewy enough to enjoy each bite.  The sharpness of bleu cheese was a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the dates, all enhanced with a red wine reduction glaze.Steamed Mussels:  I'm not a huge advocate of mussels, but these were pretty darn tasty.  No, not because of the mussels itself, but because of the aromatic coconut curry sauce that it basked in.  Coming from a Southeast Asian background, I have a strong appreciation for cuisines that infuse coconut into its entrees as well as desserts.  The concoction was so good that we were all dipping our bread into the sauce, long after the mussels cleared out.Ham & Cheese Croquetas:  I absolutely love the chicken croquettes at Portos Bakery (Burbank, CA) and never failed to order some when I'm dining elsewhere.  The smokiness of the Serrano ham and the buttery texture of the melted Manchego cheese was a match made in food heaven.  If we didn't already have a quarter of the menu sprawled out on our table, I would have suggested ordering seconds!I was extremely surprised at the serving portions of each tapas plate.  After my last experience at Viva Madrid (Claremont, CA), I anticipated on having to pick up a snack on the way back to the hotel.  Luckily, that was far from the case at Firefly.  The portions were generous and sufficient to share amongst the seven of us.  Also, if a pitcher of mojitos is on your list, I would suggest the Mango flavored one - delish!Would it be wrong of me to say that I want to come back to LV just for Firefly?
5	Hmm......30 minute wait?  Check.2 hot messes in clothing that was too tight and too young for them?  Double check.Great food?  Check.Hot hostess?  Check.So we got here at around 745pm on a Wednesday, and it was a little crowded, but I think it was worth it.  I grabbed a Jameson rocks and a Vodka cocktail at the bar for me and my buddy and we drank it happily while we waited for our table.  The thing that surprised me was how big and full of liquor my glass was!  I'm used to the glass being smaller and less full, so that was a nice surprise.  I hoped for a table outside since it was a nice warm night, but we got in at one of the lower slung tables near the front.  Comfortable seating at the low table.  A plate of bread and olives appears with waters soon after we got seated, and so did our server who took our order of the following..A pitcher of white sangria. Cold tapas  Apple and Manchego Salad - Surprisingly filling for a salad, and the cheese and almonds provided for a nutty, almost meaty addition to the salad.Artichoke Toasts -  I didn't eat any of them, but they were pretty!Tuna Peppers - Marinated poppadew peppers stuffed with tuna, and seated atop a taro chip, these were perfect morsels of food combining salty sweet and crunchy!Boquerones - I love anchovies and I like vinegar, so I ate most of these, and am biased to salted fish, but these were awesome and I don't usually like red peppers but they make sense on this dish to contrast the brininess of the anchovies and acidity of the vin.Hot tapas Stuffed Dates - Crispy bacon wrapped around a date stuffed with a smoke almond, in a red wine sauce with blue cheese, these were like the Mediterranean Turducken you've never heard of.Patatas Bravas - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli.  Wish we got the sauce on the side, and the potatoes could've been spicier, but overall solid.Fried Calamari - These were done well, not overcooked, crispy batter that stuck to the rings, and they included the heads!  Yes, I love tentacles, don't you?? Me, my wife, her sister and boyfriend split the above.  We were absolutely stuffed to the brim, and in a good way.  And, it didn't break the bank, I was expecting the bill to be much higher, but then, we did only have one pitcher and 2 drinks.  But that's because we were saving room for Luv-It.  Oh yeah.....Go to Firefly!  You go now!
5	Best tapas and best value! 4-9 dollars most of the menu and the portions are larger than at their counterpart in summerlin....two dishes for each person is a great meal! they dont open until 11.30 on weekends though....
5	The standard-bearer for tapas in Las Vegas, and one of my top spots to bring visitors, for good reason. I have never, ever had a bad dish here.Bad service, on the other hand, used to be a hallmark of the Firefly on Paradise experience. I used to tell people that the way to deal with the crap service was to have enough mojitos at the bar that you don't notice how slow and forgetful the staff can be.Fortunately, on my recent visits to Firefly they seem to have gotten their act together. I'm not sure if the restaurant's expansion into the old Dragonfly space took some of the pressure off, or what, but it's a much more dependable meal now.Some of my favorite dishes on the menu here:Ahi tuna tartare with avocado chunks, mango and taro chips - perfect blend of textures, sweet and savory. Delish.Artichoke toasts, with red pepper and garlic aioli - simple, clean flavor.Gazpacho - cool, refreshing, and light.Mushroom tart - smothered puff pastry in boursin and mushroom caps - and I don't even like shrooms.Serrano ham & manchego cheese plate.Manchego mac & cheese. Baby shells smothered in bechamel and manchego - a great grown-up twist on a classic comfort food.Ahi tuna skewer - mango, basil, and a mouth-watering mustard ginger glaze.Chicken and tomato skewers - the garlic cream sauce is ridiculously rich so use it sparingly.As for drinks - the mojitos are where it's at. Blueberry and blood orange are quality if you're looking to broaden your horizons from the original.
5	Wow! Came here twice so far. Both times my group left happy and satisfied.Can't remember everything I've had here but I'll list the standouts from my last visit.Filet mignon sliders: Although small, they were perfectly cooked and savory.Calamari: Very crispy and comes with a delicious dipping sauce.Manchego mac n cheese: Eat it when it's hot! The upper layer can get kind of hard and unappetizing but it's delicious when fresh.Now that i think about it, there are a lot more I would like to mention, but studying for the GMAT awaits. You should experience Firefly at least once when you're taking a break from gambling in Vegas.
5	Firefly is a great place, totally deserving of its Yelp rating in my opinion.  We were in Vegas, needed a good place on short notice for drinks and a late/lunch early dinner.  We got there around 4:30 or five, and later it seemed to get much busier, so short notice for a 7 pm reservation probably wouldn't be on.  But it worked out for us.  It was also happy hour, and we could have drank way more at better savings if we were trying to.  As it was, we had a pitcher of mojitos and another of margaritas, and it was all very good.The food was also really good.  Mac and Cheese was great, as were the ribs, and the lamb skewers (I think thats what it was).  Everything seemed fresh, menu is quite varied, and the food came out really quickly.  It all tasted great.  Ambiance at Firefly was lively, noise was about what you'd expect, but certainly not too noisy.Bottom line, this is not the typical Vegas experience of pricey food catered to ignorant tourists.  We are foodies, and had a great meal.  Great local spot, and I will for sure recommend this to friends on their way to sin city.
5	Love love love this place! It's a great starter place to get your night going!The last time I came here was with a group of girls for a friends birthday. We were all dressed up but didn't feel out of place. You can come dolled up or causal as well. We have come here several times now and ever time we've had good service. The food is very tasty as well. We always get the garlic fries and the Steak Skewers. We also try to order something new each time we visit.The only downfall is that we had to what an hour before being seated the past 2 visit but it was well worth it. We'll continue to bring our visitors here and friends that haven't been here yet. I look forward to the next Firefly visit.
5	We loved everything about Firefly. Stuffed dated and chocolate tres leche cake our favorites.
5	***** Apple monchego salad: amazingly refreshing and nicely balanced***** chocokate and cherry bread pudding: next level of happiness achieved.**** starter bread and butter: holy moly, best free appetizer ever**** steamed mussels: the curry makes it great. Hope u saved some bread*** boquerones: if u like anchovies,  this offers a nice few bites. Goes well with the roasted peppers. *** red wine sangrias: stiff drinks but not mind blowing by any means. Just a solid drink with ur meal*** sliders: really salty, too much bread, but the quality of the meat saves it.** empanada: overdose of sour cream, not impressive.***** service was quick. Food came out in a timely manner. Very pleased.Im freaking well fed and can barely breathe after this meal. Amazing.
3	This place was good, had a date here.. very crowded but still the atmosphere was nice, pretty noisy nonetheless food was really good, took a while to get to us, but very good!
5	Firefly, BEHOLD: a little dance party in your mouth--refreshing, fun, and just the precise amount to enjoy it all.  From the service to the sangria to the tapas, Firefly does it right. 4.5 stars.This place is an absolute delight. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves over white sparkling sangria and a ton of small plates. Good food, good drink, good company = good time. In its entirety, Firefly is the perfect Saturday lunch spot for a group of friends looking to enjoy some downtime.Recommended dishes: Firefly fries, camarones al ajillo, ahi tuna tartare, mushroom and lentils, Serrano ham and manchego cheese, sangria... I could go on but really, I loved everything.
5	As I sit here in the cold of another Chicago spring I have to find a happy place in my mind.  To do this I close my eyes and think back to one week ago today and the warmth of the Las Vegas sun on the Firefly patio.  I can not say enough about this restaurant.  We enjoyed it so much that after going for dinner on Thursday night we went back for lunch on Friday.  We are now on a quest to find something on the menu that we do not like.  I have a feeling that will not be easy.  Stuffed dates awesome....fries awesome....firefly fish sticks awesome.  In two visits in two days we had 10 different tapas....2 different sangria's and a mojito and the fruit infused vodka which I thought was awesome.  Please do not be afraid of the off strip location it is an easy cab ride to some of the best food in Vegas hands down.
4	You have to make a trip to firefly at least once if you live out here. Or if you don't. I'm not a huge fan of the concept of tapas, but these guys sold me on it fairly well. I had several pickings, including a delicious red kabob skewer that really stood out. Some cheesy fry like thing that I can't remember but I do recall was pretty tasty. Even the bread and butter is good here. And you definitely have to order a pitcher of the sangria. To the more budget minded diner, I highly recommend you take advantage of their reasonable happy hour when you have the opportunity. Tasty treats, unique dining experience, cool ambience--there's plenty to love about Firefly.
5	Firefly never disappoints. As a matter of fact I think it keeps getting better. It's like a fine wine. The stuffed dates are probably the single greatest thing I've ever eaten. I've since gone vegetarian, so I can no longer partake in those sweet bacon wrapped dreams, but there are still many great vegetarian option for me to enjoy. I haven't often looked back after going vegetarian, but the stuffed dates are definitely one thing I miss.
4	As in most Tapas bars you can really spend some money here on a meal. The food was pretty good and the dishes were very unique.
5	I absolutely LOVE Firefly. This was my first introduction to Tapas food and I haven't looked back since. There are so many great things to say. Lets start with the Sangria. The servers often say they're famous for their Sangrias, some of course are better than others and i usually recommend the sparkling, it literally drinks like juice! As far as the food goes its a smorgasbord of deliciousness!!! I'm a huge fan of tapas because they offer me a little taste of everything so my taste buds are happy and the prices aren't overly expensive. To any one going to Firefly for the first time I recommend the stuffed dates. They literally make my heart go pitter patter lol !!  Oh and dont forget the Nutella and banana sandwiches... You'll thank me later!
4	I really do love this place. And if I had reviewed them a few years ago, they'd have definitely gotten 5 stars, but I think I've gotten pickier now. It's a great place for a group, so you can try more tapas. Pitchers of sangria always make the mood more festive. They've got an excellent patio for beautiful afternoons or evenings (afternoons are more peaceful- this place gets BUSY at night). And their bacon wrapped dates and potatas bravas are some of my favorites. It does get loud when it's busy, so a tough place to catch up with old friends. And service can be hit or miss. And really, I've easily had better sangria and mojitos... But you're going for the atmosphere, bc this restaurant doesn't feel like it's in Vegas...  and the dates and potatas of course :)
1	This place is soooo off and on to me.  Is the food amazing??  yes, there is no denying that the food and drink of this resturant is amazing!  However the service always leaves something to be desired EVERY SINGLE TIME I come to the Paradise location.  For instance this past week i met up with some girlfriends to have drinks and tapas and my friend had to ask for her drink three different times and litterally 20 minutes later her diet coke showed up AFTER our sangria and mojitos had been on the table for like ten minutes.  I had to practically beg our waiter to give us any attention and to take our order.  The busser had more interaction with our table than our waiter..
5	The dates. All I need to say
3	We came here with friends and I wasn't blown away by it. I had a mediocre experience and didn't feel the food was as great as described. I'll have to admit the restaurant made me reconsider my feelings towards dates, because their stuffed dates with blue cheese was really good. The bread was also good. Other than that though, I didn't think much was special. The tuna tartare was bland, and the mac n' cheese was pretty ordinary. I prefer the steamed mussels on the Strip at Bouchon. However, because everyone has such great reviews for this place, I'll have to come back and try it again!
4	This is such a great little joint.  We hung out with a group for happy hour and the drinks were great as well as their appetizers! It was a great atmosphere! We will be going here when we go to Vegas.
4	Came here last Saturday for an early dinner with the gals. The location of Firefly is a few miles away the strip and near a corporate plaza (which reminded us of Orange County). Since we got there early (before 6 PM), there was no wait but the place was still more than half full. The restaurant has a nice, cozy, intimate feel with dark red interiors.Everyone got a glass of white sangria but I opted for an Amstel light since I'm not a fan of fruity, sweet drinks. We all ordered 2 plates each but I ordered 4 since I was starving and wanted to try a few more plates.From the plates I sample, my favorites were:Ham and Cheese Croquetas - This was a flavor explosion in the mouth! I loved the rich cheese mixed with the tasty ham and the crispy outside batter. There was some sauce drizzled on top but I couldn't make out what it wasCamarones Al Ajillo  - So.Freaking.Good. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was delicious - I wanted to drink it with a spoon. Next time, I will try the Camarones A La Diabla since that one has a spicy kick to it. Petite Filet - Despite the filet being cooked pretty much well done (I asked for medium), it was still very tender. It would've been 10x better if there was some red left in the meat. All in all, this is a great place for a date or a group outting. The atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back but the ambiance is fantastic. We're planning another girl's trip this summer and we're definitely planning on coming back here!
1	Ate there tonight.  45 minutes after I left, I threw it all up in the bathroom of a nearby store.  Instant food poisoning.I had zero to drink - zero!
5	Best tapas place I've ever been to in my whole entire young adult life.  I'll never go to Vegas again without stopping here for some grub.  Take lots of people and share.  Order one of everything, it's worth it.  Service was great - they sat a group of 12 even though we had no reservations at 6pm on a Saturday night (just told us to leave by 8).  Below I'll rate the plates individually:Artichoke Toasts - awesome - 4 starsCeviche of Shrimp - awesome - 4 starsTuna Tartare - good - 3 starsTortilla a la Espanola - not a fan but that's personal - 3 starsPatatas bravas - not the best, get the firefly fries instead - 3 starsManchego Mac N' Cheese - great - 4 starsTierra Y Mar Skewers - chorizo, shrimp and filet minon - hello? - 5 starsPulpo Asado - wish this was better but sadly it was dry - 3 starsChorizo Clams - AfreakinMazing - 5 starsCamarones A La Diabla - awesome - 4 starsTheir bread with garlic is great too.  Everyone shared pitchers of red sangria.  Sadly I couldn't have any but I heard it was good.  The atmosphere, food, portions and service makes this a 5 star place in my book.  Oh and the price.  All the food above times two plus a few other dishes I didn't try, plus tax and 20% tip came out to only $352.
5	I don't live in Vegas, but I would fly back just to eat here again and again. I don't know where to begin but this is one of the best dining experiences I've had. Plus the company I was with was the best too. We waited in the bar and were seated pretty quick considering it was Friday at 8. The bartender was awesome and made me a mean dirty martini complete with blue cheese olives. Great start.There were 6 of us and it was an ordering cluster-f*$k. But our waiter was totally all over it. He got everything down with calm ease and all the food came out so quick and no mistakes. So service was spot on. Ambiance was cozy, low lit and the room just buzzed of chatter. Food was AMAZING. The selection of tapas is vast! And, the portions are large and price is more than fair. I had the ahi poke, ham & cheese croquettes (unforgettable!), mussels and I forget what else. It was an orgy! Everyone sharing and gushing over how good it was. Firefly... I love you.  :-)
5	After almost getting smashed twice in the tight parking lot by circling minivans, we made it into Firefly.I'm a Tapas gal from way back, and El Farol in Santa Fe New Mexico is one of my all time favorite haunts!The ambience here is a bit crushed, but cordial waitstaff showed us to our table, and even allowed us to pick our table.  We chose the window, since this lively lounge is very crowded and noisy.  Enjoyed the colorful version of Guernica on the wall!Fabulous service, but I always find a smile works to break the ice, and the considerate waitress even advised me to order my drinks quick, since Happy Hour was about to end!  Two Sangrias in hand, I then perused the menu.  The white wine with aples and other fruits is light and refreshing and two for one definately made them worthwhile.Thank you fellow yelpers, for helping with decision time!  The bacon wrapped dates are todiefor!  Also the pork empanadas, would brave rampant minivans for one anytime!  Beef sliders went down with  no fuss!  The best ending was the Tres Leches Chocolate cake...like a cool cocoa with whipped  cream!  Hearty and soulful at the same time.
5	luv this place it gets rather busy some nights so its best to sometimes call ahead. Its a laid back joint the meals are cheap but can add up if you get quite a bit of them. I always get the bacon wrapped dates, camarones diabla its shrimp in a spicy sauce really good, tomato soup is good, everythings pretty good. also has pitchers of sangria
5	Please expand to the Phoenix area. Our tapas and sangria options are laughable. If I had my way, I would go on a red sangria and stuffed date diet.
4	A group of about 15 of us had dinner here before a bachelorette night out. The food was fantastic. We had a selection of five tapas that just kept appearing on our table like something out of a dream. The filet medallions and stuffed dates were my favorites. The service was a bit slow at first but once the first round of food came out it got better. The drinks were a little pricey, but the sangria was good and they had a good Spanish beer as well. I go out to Vegas once a year for business and I will definitely be back.
1	Yes their food is good but not worth being bitten time after time by spiders. Me and the girls I ate with were bit many times on our legs, when I told the manager he did nothing about it and just said they try to keep the bugs out but it's "difficult". Then just shrugged me off. Worse experience ever!
4	For sure get the dates wrapped in bacon they are delishhhhhh!!!! I was here with a large group this weekend, we enjoyed every single thing we ordered!! I cant remember the names of everything because we also had pitchers of sangria, but let me try, there were mushrooms stuffed with chorizo and chicken they were so good! And then all the skewers were good, we had chicken and lamb. The bread they serve you before the meal is also yummy! I will definitely eat at Firefly next time I am in Vegas!
4	I'm really kicking myself for not remembering exactly what I got here. It was something like filet mignon sliders and some type of shrimp diablo. Usually, I forget what I order because the food was bland and/or gross. This time I forgot because it was a late, Thursday night after a transcontinental flight, and I was eating with a cousin I see only once every 4-5 years. I was so confused from being both tired and excited that I barely remember eating.What I do remember is this place was packed!! Our food did taste great (whatever it was) and came with nice portions and reasonable prices. This was a much better experience with Spanish/Mexican food than my almost fail with Cabo Wabo on the Vegas strip. The place is literally a few blocks away from The Hard Rock Hotel, and. it's worth a cab ride from the strip there. Also, they have an excellent mojito!
3	Nice place to take a girl to at night.. Very dim and loud with music.  Service is wonderful, food portions are a bit small so don't come here starving.  Had some ahi cubes with chips.  Place is pretty packed at night and open during lunch.  Parking is very tight, small lot shared.
5	How could you find something to complain about this place.  I'm from San Diego and every time I travel to Vegas and I have to make sure I visit this place at least once.   Try this place you won't be disappointed.
5	Love this place, it was a lucky find when on a work trip and I now go everytime I am in town (at least once). This Tapas joint is in a strip-mall off the strip. Likely about a $12 cab ride from where ever you are on the strip and maybe $6 from the Hard Rock.The service has been good to great every time I have been there. This includes mostly lunch but also a few dinner services.The food is inventive and delicious. Some of my favorites are the Artichoke Toast, filet mignon sliders, bacon wrapped dates. Everything is pretty dang good - strangely enough two Tapas classics (Tortilla espanola and the patatas bravas) leave a little to be desired (note if the managers read this I would suggest cutting the patatas a little smaller for the bravas and cooking a little longer so not so "potatoe-y").The sangria is good, they have a nice happy hour, the deserts are solid, prices are fair, and the menu is very diverse and vegetarian friendly. This would be great for a business lunch, romantic/fun dinner, and a big group out.
4	Came here and tried a few things my favorites were the garlic shrimp, stuffed dates, filet mignon sliders and the firefly fries. I also tried the duck, chorizo mussles and the enpanadas those were good but nothing to rave about. The white sangria was okay nothing special.Finished off with flan and nutella sandwich, the flan was to die for.This place its really cozy great for a date or a night out with friends. The service was superb.
4	Awesome food, great people to meet and great sangria!! A gem that isn't far from the strip! One of my favorite places to go in LV!
5	Firefly is simply the best near-strip restaurant.  The only downside: a lot of people now know this, and the relatively small restaurant is now pretty much always packed (and I believe they do not take reservations).  However, the food and service is well worth the wait (or the risk of a wait).The menu is HUGE and is constantly being changed and added to, and I've yet to try something that I didn't like.  I few suggestions that I enjoy: the bacon wrapped stuffed dates are a must try, along with the ham & cheese croquetas.  The firefly fries are amazing, and big enough to share, as are the calamari.  Other suggestions include the Thai beef salad, the tuna tartar and shrimp ceviche, stuffed pepper, mac n cheese, baked talapia, and the mergeuz.  Don't fill up on the entrees too much, because the tres leches cake is probably the best thing on the menu, so save room for dessert.  Firefly is also known for its selections of sangria, infused vodkas (vodka + fresh squeezed juices), and mojitos, all of which are great - my favorites are the infused vodka on the rocks, and the passion fruit and blood orange mojitos.  Go here with a small group and order in small batches, I'd suggest 2 plates per person, per batch.  The food comes out very quick and the table can get very cluttered, very fast.  Most of the dishes here are fairly cheap, but it is very easy to go overboard and run up a large bill, especially if it's you're first visit.Even though I hate how crowded this place has become, the food is well worth the short trip off the strip, and is a must try for anyone who hasn't tried this gem yet.
4	amazing food and prices , the customer service sucks though
4	Went to the Firefly restaurant based upon their menu. The food was really good, good service from Jesus and the people sitting next to us offered us tastes of their food since this was our first Tim at the restaurant. The only issue was the sound level in the restaurant, it was packed (with good reason) and as a result noisy. The Padilla was very good, the sausage plate and the Serrano Jason plates reminded me of Spain. Mainly locals in the restaurant, great food, reasonable prices and good sangria (we had red). If you are in Las Vegas and like tapas' go to Firefly. I would give 5 for food and 3 for ambiance, so a 4.
4	Ask the locals and they'll all tell you to go to Firefly. Great place about a block away from the strip that touches all your senses! Sexy dark ambiance more on the casual-chic side.Service is meh.Food is AMAZEBALLS!Wine, tapas and good company...what more could you want?So 4 girls walk in to this place and had to seat themselves and wave down a waiter after a long wait. Menu has a great selection of items. Bacon wrapped dates are great. Manchego mac and cheeze is to die for, Tuna tartare is ok, Baby beet salad is :), Camarones a la diabla MAS POR FAVOR!, Petite Filet my fav, stuffed mushrooms you can't go wrong, Lamb Skewers bueno, and steamed mussels gotta have em! Four girls left stuffed and ready for a nap. Speechless none the less. You are doing yourself a diservice if you don't try this place! Wish we had one in LA :(
5	I love this place and make it a point to go there at least once when I visit Vegas.Local friends introduced me to it years ago. It's always crowded, but service is still pretty good for the amount of business they handle. I love the Sangrias and Mojitos. Never ever have I left sober from here. :-)This is my favorite tapas place of all tapas places, including the ones in LA, and it's also not as expensive as fanc, wanna-be tapas places in LA are. Such a variety! You can never pick enough plates, there are always a bunch left that you want to try. I just love the fact that I can have 5-6-7 different dishes and not just 2. I can't even pick favorites, although it seems that I always start with the Apple & Manchego salad and I always have at least one order of the fish sticks.I love the fact that even vegetarians or people who don't eat red meat can choose from a lot of stuff. They even made me the blue cheese stuffed dates without the bacon wrapped around it once. I usually have a lot of seafood and veggie tapas and some chicken.Even the music is Spanish speaking (sometimes American songs covered by a Spanish speaking band), so it totally fits the atmosphere. All in all, I can't say enough good things about this place. I love it here.
5	uh.maze.ing. You don't see many restaurants rated at 4.5 stars very often. And a local friend recommended this place as his favorite so we were intrigued. The restaurant is in a little strip mall of a parking lot- nothing too fancy. The dress is nice but casual and you don't need a suit. There are no stuffy white table cloths to be found. I'm sure they appreciate elbows off the table but I love any restaurant where I don't have to be conscious about proper manners. We went early around 7:30/8pm and luckily our group of 6 immediately got a table. The service was great, ambiance was perfect and the food was incredible. Order the pitcher of red sangria ($28). It was delicious!We ordered 3 plates each expecting little servings of tapas. We were surprised with the generous portions (small salad plate style) and was planning on ordering more but couldn't even finish those. I can't decide what was my favorite. All of these dishes woke up our taste buds: bacon wrapped Stuffed Dates, Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Filet Mignon Sliders, Crispy Duck Roll, Babyback Ribs, Fried Calamari, Warm Spinach Salad with strawberries.Trio of Gelato (pistaccio is my fav) and the Dessert Platter were yummy. The dessert platter was just a taste of all the desserts and just enough so we didn't feel like we were missing out. We couldn't have fit any more food in our bellies.I would skip the Fish Sticks (wish they would make them smaller and it was nothing special). And the Artichoke Toasts were the only disappointment. They sounded so hopeful on the menu but were served cold and in a chunk. It couldn't keep up with the rest of the wonderful plates on our table. And best of all, our bill was affordable and didn't break the bank.
5	I love everything about Firefly. The food, the ambiance, the drinks. It's such a great place to go when you're in the mood for drinks. I can't imagine going here and not ordering food though. My favorite tapas are the stuffed dates and the warm spinach salad. For drinks I prefer their red sangria and mango mojito. I've been meaning to try their sparkling sangria since I've heard it's delicious as well. This is a place I am always up for going to. Easily one of my favorite places in town.
5	I love this place. Super yummy and affordable, with a great vibe. The Paradise location is the best. My fav tapas are the bacon wrapped dates, stuffed peppers, ham and cheese croquetas, and the salads. Worth it to wait to sit in the main restaurant rather than the "annex" thing they've got going on.
4	Coming from the east coast to visit, I wanted to get away from the strip to have lunch.  So my friends thought it be a great idea to take me for Tapas and Sangrias. Of course - it did not disappoint!1) We had Chicken salad -chopped breast, grapes, smoked almonds, creamy cider dressing, endive.  This wasn't anything special, just a regular chicken salad if you ask me.2)  Smoked Salmon Toasts - brioche toast, dill sour cream, pickled red onion, capers.  This was okay, I think I expected this to be fresher, it the salmon was colder it would probably be better.3) Stuffed Dates - bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  This was an awesome dish.  who doesn't love bacon wrapped apps?  4)  Padron Peppers - flash-fried, touch of salt; most are mild.  Always a signature tapas dish, can't really go wrong with these.5)  Stuffed Peppers Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce.  I thought this was okay.  6)  Manchego Mac N Cheese baked w/ baby shells.  This was a pretty awesome dish, I would definitely recommend this dish.7) Tierra y Mar skewers grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde.  This was okay, skewered meat. 8)  Chorizo Clams - grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde.  This was not bad, it was a flavorful and the toasts that came with it went great with the sauce.9)  Filet Mignon Sliders - mini burgers w/Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions.  I thought this was only okay, nothing special.And we had a pitcher of Red Sangria.  This was really good and I recommend this with the meal.I would definitely want to come back here again when I come back out to Vegas.
3	Overall the tapas plates we tried were okay.  We got a table in less than 15 min on a Friday which was nice, but that was because we were there around 5:30pm.  We ordered the curry mussels because this was my favorite thing I tried on the east coast and I have been determined to find a suitable replacement on the west coast.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the sauce was a little more coconut, and a lot less curry than what I have been craving.  The patatas bravas were good, I loved the spicy aioli, but I would have preferred a crispier outer layer on the potatoes.  Some of them had it, but most did not.My favorite tapas was the tuna peppers, which was surprising because this was not my pick but I am so happy that we ordered it because the dish is delicious, and they have a perfect little kick to them.And finally, I ordered the tortilla de espanola.  I could eat this all day.  While my husband loved the bell pepper vinaigrette, I was not a fan.
4	Great food, great drinks, great vibe, pretty girls everywhere, and I looked everywhere except the ladies room. I'm guessing there were pretty girls in there too, but I don't like to make assumptions. You won't be disappointed at Firefly
5	Firefly got rave reviews from friends, family members, and the Yelp universe, so we knew we had to give it a try during our Las Vegas visit. We got there right when it opened on a Thursday, and were the first patrons seated. Within fifteen minutes, the place was packed. The waiter recommended the pomegranate martini, so I went with that - my friend ordered the sangria with red wine (you can choose between red, white, or sparkling).When the fresh bread coated with huge pieces of sweet roasted garlic, honey almond butter and olives on the side arrived, I knew this was going to be a good experience. My martini was a little lackluster, so the waiter brought me a side of extra pomegranate juice to add more flavor. My friend's sangria, however, was perfect as presented. The meal (Yes, we ate all of this in one sitting, don't judge):1) Stuffed dates wrapped in bacon with smoked almond, blue cheese, in a red wine reduction - Oh my goodness. These were so good we ordered them twice. The dates were sweet and melted in your mouth, offset by the crunchy bacon and almonds, the sharp blue cheese, and the savory red wine sauce. 2) Artichoke hearts with basil, garlic aioli, and red pepper - Normally, I steer cleer of red peppers, but these had a sweet, mellow flavor that went perfectly with the artichoke. The artichoke hearts are served cold and are absolutely impossible to eat gracefully, but so good that you don't mind.3) Manchego mac n' cheese with sundried tomatoes - the waiter recommended this one, and honestly, it was delicious, but not mind blowing. Pretty standard mac n' cheese, but with a delicious baked crust on top. I would definitely eat it again, but not with the same...smack-your-grandma-for-another-serving-gusto that I felt with the dates.4) Shrimp tempura with ponzu-mandarin orange dipping sauce - crispy, golden, tempura perfection with a superb sweet-salty-tangy dipping sauce. 5) Ahi tuna skewers with mango, basil, and a mustard ginger glaze - This was the only disappointment of the day. The presentation was amazing...and the separate sauces were delicious, but the mango was very underripe, and the tuna was wayyyy overcooked. We probably should have said something, but we had a lot more eating to do, and we didn't want to make the chef mad.6) Lobster "escargots" - this dish was adorable. Little knobs of lobster tail were served on a silver dish swimming in garlic herb butter. There is very little lobster on the plate, but the pieces you get are tender and flavored beautifully with the butter.*Yes...we are STILL eating...*7) Roasted eggplant canneloni with goat cheese and tomato sauce - This dish was super simple and super delicious. The goat cheese lent a tangy, creamy component to the dish, and the sauce was simple, fresh and delicious.8) Crispy duck roll with cherry hoisin sauce - Maybe it was because we were getting a little full, but I thought this dish was delicious, but way too big. The duck roll comes wrapped in a wonton about twice the size of your standard egg roll, and stuffed with duck meat. The meat is a little on the dry side, and the lack of anything else in the roll makes it a little difficult to eat. I would have liked it a lot more with some fresh veggies inside, or at about half the size. It was a LOT of meat.*Are you impressed with our appetites yet?*9) Camarones a la diabla - shrimp in a spicy chile sauce - shrimp was cooked well...the sauce is definitely on the milder side. Nice kick, but no afterburn. *Dessert time! Obviously, we ordered two...*10) Lemon-berry tarts - These were delicious. Lemon curd was served in crisp cookie shells with a raspberry drizzle, fresh blueberries and a mound of whipped cream. 11) Sorbet of the day - Pineapple, Mango, and Cantelope sorbets topped with fresh berries, and Grand Marnier. The perfect light way to end this amazing meal. - Other memorable moments from the meal: An older lady came over specifically to tell us that we "Really did it right" - and my grandmother called...completely convinved that I said I was at a topless restaurant...not a tapas restaurant. Good times.
5	Mojito pitchers and yummy tapas!!!!  One of the best bday dinners EVER!!!!  I recommend the bacon-wrapped dates- I was VERY skeptical, but damn... So good!  Don't forget the grilled potatoes!
4	Everytime I came to Vegas, my cousin would tell me to come here. Never had the chance until this past weekend and it was well worth the visit. The food is really good here. Tapas style so you can just order a whole array of things. Got both the white and red sangria. I liked the red better but I think it's just a matter of preference between a red wine or white wine. Ordered so many things and they were all delicious. Artichoke Toast - the artichoke is cold on warm bread, I prefered the salmon toastSalmon Toast - this was delicious. Smoked salmon, capers, onions on toastTuna Tartare - came with taro chips, I love tuna tartare so it was one of my favoritesBaked Filet of Tilapia - this had some crispy onions on top, simple/clean flavorsFried Calamari - this was just an average dish, you can find it anywhereSteamed Mussels - the sauce that came with this was really good. creamy and delicious. Chorizo Clams - these were recommended, and I really liked them. The chorizo gave a nice kick. Camarones a la Diabla - I loved the sauce that came with this. A little heat and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. Chicken & Chorizo stuffed Mushrooms - One of my favorites. I'm not normally a fan of chicken in anything, but these were delious! Crispy Duck Rolls - this was the only semi asian dish on the menu, it comes with a cherry hoison sauce. It was really good and meatyStuffed Dates - this wasn't a favorite but it's the most popular dish there. Sweet and bacon don't go together in my mindThai Beef Salad - didn't get to try this... but from what I saw it disappeared quick for a reasonParmesean Fries - Love this! The aioli dip that came with it was a perfect matchDefinitely will make a trip back here when I get the chance again!
5	Had to go check it out the Firefly when we went to Vegas last week for my birthday.  After reading the Yelp reviews and recommendation from the VIP hostess at the casino where we were staying..I made reservations for May 7th!  Good thing I did..the place was packed.   My goal was to find a place where we could have some great food and have fun eating!  Upon our arrival we were told it would be about 30 minutes so we went to the bar and got pitchers of their Sangria.  Excellent!  It was a dry red wine with fresh fruit as it should be not the sugary mix at all!  We were seated on the outdoor patio on a smallish round table and there were 5 of us!  We ordered and ordered and ordered...I think in all we had 20 different tapas!  Then the games began, the servers were bringing us plate after plate of tapas and as we devoured them they were there clearing the dirty plates.  It was so much fun!  I think we had a small army waiting on us because there were servers coming and going the entire time!  The tapas were all outstanding!  I would list them but, just get the menu and pick out 20 of them and that should cover it.   We all enjoyed each and every one!  I got so full that I couldn't eat another bite.   All that food and the check was a mere $125!!!The one negative about the Firefly is the noise level!!!! ouch...it is sooo loud!  I know there are lots of people and it is a lively type environment but perhaps some sort of sound proofing to absorb the sound would be helpful?  The Firefly is our new "have-to-go-to restaurant when we go to Vegas" now!  Must warn folks...MAKE a reservation!  We were there on a Monday and it was packed...I'm sure weekends are flat insane.  One thing, that staff can certainly handle all that and then some.  They were rockin' it!
4	I took my two tweenage boys here and we had a wonderful meal. I loved our wait staff, and I loved watching them and the kitchen people making and delivering the food. I had lamb skewers, chix skewers, filet sliders, parmesan fries - so yummy!  We all loved it so much, we are going to buy shirts from the website. It is a cool place. The only drawback was how loud it was - Friday night, early, it was PACKED! A testament to it's goodness! I already want to go back with hubby!!!
5	Firefly is the type of place that fills my heart with warm fuzzies when I think about it. Each time I've visited Vegas, I've dined here, and it has always -- always -- been worth it.On my most recent visit, we made a reservation through Open Table, which worked out perfectly.  Even on a Tuesday evening, the place was hopping.  We were seated immediately and attended to by friendly staff.  We split the red sangria and ordered an assortment of small plates, including the following: Firefly fries, mushroom tart, manchego mac 'n' cheese, fried calamari, and lamb chops.  Per usual, everything was fantastic, especially the mushroom tart.We rounded out our meal with caramel flan and banana-Nutella sandwiches. If you try nothing else here, order. the. banana. nutella. sandwiches. So perfect. And entirely worth it.Overall, I would sing Firefly's praises to the highest heavens.  If you're in Vegas, make sure to include it on your must-see list.
4	Ok so, bumping you back up. My friends dig it and I very much enjoy your sangria, warm vibes and company Firefly. But don't think for a second you can take my love for granted and start slippin' on me again.
5	Aaaammmmmazing as always.. not sure how many times I can update my review but I'm back.. lol.. I have been here at least 8 times now & their is only one thing that I tried that I didn't like... the ribs.. everything else is something special.. Just recently tried the apple & manchego salad.. yum.. also tried their infused vodka, yummy! lamb was good but a little overcooked & fatty. This last time we tried their desserts for the first time.. We got the sample platter & everything was good. nothing over the top like there food though. cna't wait to go back again :)
5	This place was great!wonderful ambiance, everything on the menu sounded awesome and everything we ordered was yummy ;)
3	I am not sure why people swoon over this iteration of Firefly.  It's not bad, but it is not great.  Service was spotty, the food my wife and I ordered was delivered haphazardly and late, and it just was not great.  The garlic fries are always tasty, the bacon wrapped stuffed figs I ordered were burned, and while we wanted this to be our "go to" place, it just wasn't good enough to warrant a return visit.  Maybe we just got the wrong food.  I like the Paradise location better, but maybe it was the trip to Madrid and San Sebastian that spoiled me....this just did not deliver the authentic tapas experience I was hoping for.....
5	One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!if i could have my way, i would always be able to order 50 small dishes and nibble on everything while sipping yummy white wine sangria.... i nibble and mix food all the time.  When it comes to food i like options and choices, so while buffets aren't my thing... tapas is always a good idea to me!This place is always packed and I truly believe it's worth the wait.  The food is good and the service is speedy.  The environment is dark, perfect for hanging out with friends, a date... enjoying good spirits and great food.  There are two parts of this joint.  i think there was a bar or something that went out of business and Firefly bought the place out but never knocked down the wall.  Either side is great and both offer full service bars.There's a lot of items to choose from on the menu and everything is delicious!Some of my favorite  items: smoked salmon toasttuna tartarestuffed datesahi tuna skewersfirefy friesthe mac and cheese.... etc.,there's so much more but.... i'll list the entire menu out if i keep going.the best thing to do would be to go and try everythng!  bring friends, family, a date... and enjoy the red and white sangia too.... expect a wait!  its a very popular and hip place.
5	For When you've got some friends in town and you want them to have a fun interactive social dining experience with amazing food that they will talk about with their friends when they go back home this is the place. Also awesome for dates when you want to take turns picking what to order and sampling each others food.  I always LOVE coming to this place. the food isn't crazy expensive, its delicious and its fun! Its always packed here so you really should call ahead and make reservations. I would possibly take away 1/2 a star because sometimes its a little too loud which takes away from the social aspect...since it can be hard to hear your friends. Tips:Make reservationsGet a pitcher of sangria. Try the bacon wrapped stuffed dates.
5	Love, love, love this place!!! It is "a must" if you like tapas! I am obsessed with the blood orange mojitos! Some tasty plates we order: sliders, abondigas, tortilla espanola, skewers, and tres leches... just to name a few. This is the culinary highlight of my Vegas trips!
5	Tapas party of 1.  Everything was spectacular: Apple/manchego salad is a really great little salad.  The shrimp ceviche was plentiful and fresh.  The tilapia fried fish with spicy tarter sauch fulfills your fix for fish n' chips.  I can't wait to go back there with a group for HH.
5	Sangria, savory meatballs, chicken on a stick smothered in creamy garlic sauce, cute little fish sticks, empanadas, and some of the most interesting dishes I have ever seen. I have never had tapas before and I actually love it! Instead of one big meal, you can try different little meals and still reach the point of sitting back, smiling, sometimes groaning with joy at how much delicious food was consumed. When I say groaning with joy, I am saying that you cannot possibly complain that you ate too much in a negative way because your taste buds were jumping with joy when you ordered that second round of meatballs, but know you probably should not have. It is so worth it! Some might say that this place is a bit small, but I think that is what makes the atmosphere in this place fit in with the bite sized treats. I love the lighting in this place so much! I hate places that are so bright you feel like 8pm is really 2pm. The dimness and the outside string lights are just perfect for me. I think I love sitting outside more than inside. I sat outside and was just in love with the weather, the scenery, I was really just in love with evening here. We did go around 6 or 7, but as we were finishing up, the place started getting packed! It was a Monday night. So, I would advise when reading some of the other reviews when they say make reservations or get their early, because it does get busy. That is a good thing though, because I definitely plan to go back MANY times!Now I know where to go if a date asks me what I want rather than surprising me. :)
5	Buen Provecho! Deelicious and super busy! Came here with my sister and got in a corner table at the peak of Happy hour. The hostesses were very friendly and quick to seat us. The meat skewers, bread and cheese, fried (sauteed?) green peppers, parmesean fries and even the mini bread with garlic butter came out quickly. The kitchen was turning it out! The servers and bussers didn't skip a beat with refilling water or even bringing the check. Go early if you can. Can be a bit of a wait if you have a party of 4 or more, as we saw when heading out after 630pm. All I can say is the food and ambiance was full of life and quite noisy! It's in a small complex with other businesses, parking can also be a bit of a challenge.
5	I learned about this restaurant from my sister who said we just had to try this place  when we vacation in Vegas. I'm so glad we did! My husband who was hesitant to try tapas, thinking portions would be super small, was pleasantly surprised!We got seated instantly at around 7PM when they had a crowded dinner hour. Quick service. Had to try the sangria! Loved it! We had chorizo stuffed mushrooms, thai beef salad, mussels, and calamari. Our plates were totally cleaned off. The flan is also excellent here. Great atmosphere and hang out spot. We even had our 2 year old daughter with us and she loved the place. It's loud enough in here for kids and not totally formal. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas.
3	Food is good. The service improves, but staggers to fill their customers needs due to understaffed for the volume of customers. Try the sangria !
4	Why oh why does Firefly have to be located 2,082 miles away from my home?This place was flat out awesome; almost everything about it was perfectThe atmosphere is nice; looks can be deceiving because Firefly is located in a small strip mall and on the outside does not look impressive but the inside is surprisingly cozy and relaxing.  The outside patio is where you want to be as long as it isn't too hot, sitting outside was a very cool experience, even though there isn't much to look at, it's always nice to enjoy a good meal and quality drink in the open air.The drinks were delicious, well at least the sangria that I enjoyed as well as the Riesling that my friend enjoyed were.  Some of the best sangria that I have had in my entire life, sweet and savory.The food was awesome, we ordered 5 plates and the food was not only good but surprising filing, most tapa places you need 5 or 6 plates per individual but 5 plates were actually enough for a party of 2 to get full.  We had the smoked salmon toast, delicious, the Thai beef salad, delicious, shrimp tempura, delicious, fried calamari, delicious and the steak and mushroom skewers, delicious.  Not one part of the food was a miss; all 5 plates were flavorful and utterly enjoyable. My only issue was with the service, the main waiter we had wasn't very attentive and also messed up on part of the order. I asked for lobster "escargot" but instead was served lamb skewers which I sent back.  I mean I guess it's an honest mistake; both do start with the letter L but come on now you can't mix up lobster and lamb.  Even with that said, overall service was pretty good, the guy in charge of refilling my water glass and clearing my plates was excellent and really likeable; if only he could teach the main waiter something all would be good.Firefly is a must visit if you are in Vegas, I don't care if it's off the strip or in a little strip mall, the food, drinks and overall experience was awesome! Definitely worth a return visit, if only it weren't so far away from where I currently am.
3	Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the food at Firefly. Everything is extremely tasty and it really is one of the best tapas restaurants around. Everything from the starter plate of toasted bread, olives, and almond butter to the dessert of rum soaked bananas and nutella sandwiches is perfect. I really don't think I've had a dish there that I didn't like! My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, macaroni and cheese, stuffed mushrooms, and paella.  BUT minus a few stars because I was trying to pay for the meal sneakily so I handed off my credit card to the waitress as I "went to the restroom". She brought it back to me at the table saying that my card was declined...which was embarrassing. I didn't think it was possible so I asked another waiter to try it again and then I was told it's actually their SYSTEM that was down. Honestly in that kind of situation I would have appreciated if they handled it a little more appropriately or at least pulled me to the side to let me know instead of stating it in front of the entire party. Luckily I was with two of my closest friends so it wasn't THAT big of an embarrassment..
4	Seriously, this has to be one of my favorite spots when I come to Vegas. The drinks, the tapas, the ambiance is all fabulous.One warning. If you book a large group, have the first person check in when they arrive. I brought a group of students here and we didn't check in until everyone arrived and then despite being 15 minutes early for our reservation, we waited over an hour after our reservation time to be seated (with pre-made reservations guaranteed with a credit card). Once we were seated, everything was fine. However making 20+ people wait while one table sits (and doesn't order anything else) is ridiculous.However, if you aren't bringing a large group, this place is awesome. The dishes are priced right. The drinks are pricey but no more pricey than the nearby strip!You have to try the dates. Seriously. No really. Has anyone mentioned those dates yet in a review? Other must tries: Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Padron Peppers, and Crispy Duck RollsVegetarian? Some of the favorites of my vegetarian friends (including the Padron Peppers) are the Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Tart, and Nutella Sandwiches
3	I think with this place having SUCH high reviews, I expected more. instead, the popular dishes listed on yelp really were kind of a letdown minus a few shining starsSTARS!!!-the RED SANGRIA! prob one of the yummiest sangrias i've had in awhile-the stuffed dates. I don't even normally like dates, but it was wrapped in amazing bacon goodness AND it didn't taste liek a date! haha-tuna tartare, this was my favorite........just light, refreshing, fresh tuna and perfect amount of avocado and the chips that came with it were delicious!- the service. amazing service. everyone here is very friendly and sweet.average:artichoke toasts. They were good, but not great.crispy duck roll was a little dry and only ok, but still flavorful and yes, filled with lots of ducksome downfalls :(all the other dishes we ate.-the shrimp ceviche was sooo sour, they basically just threw in lemon juice into a bowl and threw some shrimp in it-the famed filet mignon sliders had terrible bread and the steak was chewythe "manchego mac n' cheese" lacked flavor and was really blandI've definitely been to better tapas spots and if I'm back in vegas, unfortunately, will most likely not be back.
5	HOLY SHIZNIT! THIS PLACE IS EFFIN GOOD! I came one night last year with the fellaz during a night of drunken stupor and I thought it was good. Of course I had to second guess myself and make sure it wasn't just the alcohol in my system that was doing the tasting. So when I came back this year with my wife, I had to be sure.  We landed in Vegas at around noon and decided to head straight for Firefly. It was a nice day, the sun was out and the wind was blowing a little so we decided to sit outside. The service was very attentive and the red sangria quenched our thirst. Here's what we ordered:Stuffed Dates wrapped with bacon - There's something about stuffing a date that's exciting(in every sense of the word). Crunchy on the outside moist on the in. Blue cheese compliments the flavor. One of my favorite items. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TDQQuCXIqJHFP8Ts5YtTzw&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYAStuffed Peppers -  For some reason I like things that are stuffed with other things. These were not as good as the dates, but good enough.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pRmb8_tAP5y4YPt_viL07g&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYASteamed Mussels -  Moist, tender, succulent. And they came with garlic bread to sop up the sauce they came in. Two thumbs up.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x52o2wmZ4n0IkslttyemMA&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYACrispy Duck roll - Crispy and full of duck, topped with hoisin sauce and green onions. Finger-licking good.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SRf8mX8LTkTJNr3ZX9sCCA&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYAPadron Peppers - Green like the Hulk, but not overwhelmingly strong. The have a nice subtle flavor and are complemented nicely with sea salt and lemon. Very tasty.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W8-Bsk_hHg5pxbt4EhmPWQ&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYATierra y Mar Skewers - It's like having steak and lobster on a skewer. And topped with salsa verde! DAYAMN!!!! So good.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zjGBgrgyJLzHSeKsVE7L3w&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYAI've been to other Spanish Tapas places in other cities and this is by far the best that I have tasted. Maybe they drug their food with some kind of min-altering substance. I don't know. But this place has awesome food, great service and a sexy atmosphere. I wish we had one just like it in DC.
5	Have always been passing by this place whenever I'm in town. But I'm so glad we finally gave it a try. The place is packed even on a Monday night! My cousins who live in Vegas said that they always had to wait to be seated most of the time. So I was surprised that they had room for 5 of us in no time. Considering that they are busy, service was still very fast and efficient. The lighting was dimmed but the place was very well decorated. Here are some of the things we ordered:-watermelon mojito: be warned. The yummieness hides the true power of the rum.. After 2 pitchers we had to stop before we all become too drunk to go home -sausage plate:came with 3 kinda of meats with Dijon mustard spread. It was good because the meats were sliced thinly enough so you can enjoy the flavors-tuna tartare: came with taro chips. Sooooo gooooooddddd!!! Perfectly seasoned an balanced out with some avocado chunks-calamari: it was good. It came in a bigger plate too.. Best for sharing!-chorizo and cheese fondue: I forgot the name of the dish but it was very rich!! If you like cheese and spicy sausage then this one's for you!-tuna stuffed peppers- has a medium spicy kick which reminds me of spicy sardines-lamb skewers: tasted like a smokey savory lamb BBQ so good!!-chorizo stuffed mushrooms: again, cheesy gooey and meaty all in one bite -smoked salmon crostini: tasted good, but it's the usual cream cheese,dill and salmon in toasted bread. -stuffed peppers: not a big fan of cream cheese but this was surprisingly not creamy. The peppers were baked to perfection and came out tender and sweet-lamb chops: 2 lamb chops $10. I think that's a pretty good deal. And the flavor? Omg perfectly grilled and seasoned in a bed of peppers and lentils. This for me was the best out of all of them.The prices range from $4.50-12.00 so if you're pretty adventurous with food and want a little bit of everything, grab a few friends and head on over the fire fly. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
4	Tried this place on a friends suggestion, and I was hooked. Love the ambiance, and the food is amazing. The wait staff at this location are usually fairly attentive, genuine,  quick, and also they make good eye candy. Some of my personal favorites:Shrimp ceviche- the ONLY place I will eat ceviche. Very acidic and refreshingStuffed Dates- I didn't think I was going to enjoy it, but it was a semi foodgasm. Warning, there are smoked almonds in this dishFirefly fries- I know, its fries but they are amazing fries, complete with a killer aioli, and covered in parmesanHam and cheese croquetas- creamy, slightly smoky, salty. Only complaint is the size, but it is a tapas jointFilet mignon sliders- talk about heaven. Order it medium rare for max juiciness. Comes topped with serrano ham, cabrales cheese (a cheese from the north of Spain, similar to gorgonzola I think), and caramalized onions.Albondigas- Spanish style meatballs in a sherry tomato sauce. Meatballs are nice, unctuous, succulent, a perfect mouthful when paired with that sauce Caramel flan- Now I'm puerto rican, lived with puerto ricans and mexicans that made authentic flan, and this flan was sinful. perfect amount of sweet, the custard was really eggy with that beautiful caramelized taste.Desserts in general- Order the desert platter and get the trio of gelato on the side. The desert platter comes with the flan, a lemon and berry tart, choclate tres leche, passion fruit cheesecake. Surprisingly so, the tres leche was the consensual least favorite.Items that were not so great:Crispy Duck roll- Disappointing, because I love duck. But the duck was lost in the cherry hoisin sauce. It was cloyingly sweet.Empanada- Hopefully my table just got a bad batch, because the pork inside the pastry was overcooked and dry.That's pretty much it. Oh, the red wine Sangria, delicious. Order a whole pitcher, probably the best sangria I've ever had
4	The filet mignon sliders are the best!The atmosphere was a little too busy and noisy for the couple we were dining with, but to be expected in this little hot spot not far from the strip. Shaded outdoor seating is available as well although we chose to dine indoors (our friends visiting from the SF Bay Area thought 85 degrees was much too hot to be eating outside!) The food is good and reasonably priced. I've been here for lunch several times, and it is not as crowded as the dinner group, but still quite busy. Our server was attentive and knew the menu well enough to make some good suggestions. He was also happy to take a couple of pictures of us at our table before we dug into the tapas which began arriving quite quickly once our order was placed :-)
5	Loved it!went there for late dinner with my husband on Monday night,it wasnt too busy,so we didn't have to wait for a table.service was great,our waitress was nice and very attentive.We tried 5 different dishes:-dates wrapped in bacon!A must!im not a big fan of bacon,but it was so gooooood!i still can taste on my tongue-ceviche was okay,I felt it needs a bit more flavor-ahi poke with taro chips,it was good!big pieces of tuna,just loved it-lamb skewers was yummy too,my husband is a big fan of lamb,he knows when its good,he loved these one!-beef sliders was great as well,it was melting in my mouth!We also got a pitcher of red wine sangria by recommendation our server,it was good,with apple pieces,has a nice flavor.but we couldn't even finish it!their pitchers are big!you have to share it with 3-4 ppl!Looking forward to come back and I will bring more people!
5	First coming here was such an amazing experience.  From the stuffed dates, mango spare ribs, thai beef salad, and the mussels, man! what amazing food.  The service is always on the top of their toes, i hardly ever have to ask them to refill my drink or have to call them to come to the table.  They always check up on you whether if it is busy or not.  My personal favorites are:stuffed dates (i always order at least 2)tres leches (dessert)thai beef saladmac & cheesemango spare ribsjust recently lobster escargotI love this spot and my favorite firefly location :) cant go wrong with this place.
4	This place is great! The atmosphere is so chill, and the decor is awesome. Food and service was great! Will defiantly be coming back!
4	Great food and atmosphere! I love this place!
5	When I retired from the Air Force, we had my retirement dinner here.  This is where I bring my out of town friends when I want to impress them.  Casual atmosphere, great food, 3-day marinated sangria, great prices. Just take your time and enjoy. Make reservations through Urbanspoon for dining points.
4	Loved it. Great food and nice staff. Very noicy.
5	This place was definitely a highlight on our Vegas trip, and worth the trip off the strip!Any place thats packed at 10pm on a weeknight has got to be good. Of course we weren't expecting to have to wait a half hour that late, but it was worth it.Sparkling Sangria was great, my sister didn't like her mojito too much, but I have a feeling she doesn't like mojitos at all haha.We ordered about 6 small plates, most I cant remember. They bring you a small plate of bread, olives and some kind of delicious flavored whipped buttery stuff as soon as you sit down. It was small, but enough to keep us from eating our napkins we were so hungry.The food was AMAZING and inexpensive too. Our favorite dish by far was the chorizo stuffed clams. O.M.G. i would seriously eat this as my last dish before I die. Heavenly. I would drive 10 hours back to vegas just for this. I think with drinks and however many plates we ordered it only came out to about 50 bucks!
1	horrible not tolerable waiting period.The waiter selects and profiles who he will handle first.We came in and sat down. The waiter never not once came to me butTook care of TWO other older customers that were seated AFTER me. Theywere next to me.Waitresses have prissy attitude problems that ownershould be aware of.We just got up and left.
5	On our last night in Vegas, we had a work dinner at Firefly. My boss actually scouted this place on Yelp and made a reservation. Good job, bossman! Needless to say, I was excited about this place all week due to the raving Yelp reviews, and my fellow Yelpers did not lead us astray!We started with the Sparkling Sangria, which was delicious! Then I sat back and watched my two coworkers, who I lovingly refer to as "Woodchipper 1.0," and "Woodchipper 2.0" literally suck down plate after plate after plate of delicious food. I wish I would have videotaped this scene, it was epic. The bacon wrapped dates were probably the most amazing thing I have I ever tasted in my entire life. Seriously! I think the "Woodchippers" had at least 25 of those each. All in all, we had the best time. Great laughs, great food, and great times! I highly recommend this joint. It is straight awesome sauce. :)
5	Another 6 star if I could!! No this is not my first time at Firefly so I can write a well rounded review. However, every single time I go to Vegas I make sure that I stop at Firefly for some of their stuffed dates, mar y tierra skewers, their sangria (fave is red) and calamari. This is ohhh so good and it's not uber expensive if you were eating on the strip or a buffet. This last time was for a bachlorette fiesta and we had 13 guests. The drinks were flowing and the food was coming and the bill was less than $400 (with tip). AND we order desert. Not bad if you ask me especially since we had at least 8 pitchers of sangria. Hit up Firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks.
4	Love this place!!!!  They have the best Mojitos & Sangria.  And every visit the must have items on menu are the Stuffed Dates & Lamb Chops!!!!  Till my next visit......
5	Was in Vegas to celebrate my friend's graduation.  We were highly recommended this restaurant, so my husband and I thought we would give it a try.  The place was busy on the Friday night we went.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated indoors.  The ambiance was fabulous.  We ordered several small plates because we wanted to try everything.  While we were waiting for our food, they brought us this appetizer with olives, bread, and an almond spread.  It was very good!  We also ordered a sangria, which was delicious.  Our waiter was fabulous, always checking in on us and making sure our drinks were always filled.  She also timed our food just right, so our plates came out in groups, and we didn't have too much on the table at one time.  Definitely well worth the 30 minute wait.  We loved the food so much that our friends ending up coming too because we talked so highly of the place.  They also had a great experience. Will definitely come back when we are in town again!
4	Went here with 3 friends for a night of tapas and sangria....It did not disappoint!Everything we ordered was excellent and reasonably priced.  I tried red and white sangria and enjoyed both, but I have to say I liked the red better (probably just a personal preference.)  What makes this place special is that there is something for everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian. I tried the anchovy dish cause a friend ordered it, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Not fishy at all like I expected.  My favorite dish I tried was the Tuna Peppers.  I found that they used the a lot of the same ingredients in different dishes, so you could stick with one flavor profile, or you could totally mix it up.  There's a lot to choose from so I suggest that everyone at the table orders two dishes to start, then you take it from there.  We saved room for dessert and ordered the sampler.  I'm glad we did, cause it had a little bit of everything.  Overall, its not a bad cab ride from the strip, and a great place to come with friends!
4	With 991 other reviews written, I'm probably not going to tell you something you couldn't already read, but here goes.  Came here at Midnight on a Thursday night/Friday morning, gathering friends from poker tables across the city via text and hoping they were hungry (or thirsty) enough to join us.   No problem getting a table for seven inside when we walked in.  We ordered about 30% or so of the full menu and a couple of pitchers of the red sangria and took our time.  Standouts of the night were the bacon-wrapped dates (mmm sweet and savory to boot!), the pork empanada, manchego mac n' cheese, and albondigas.  The sangria was not very strong, which is probably a good thing or else we would have been in trouble.  Considering we were going to enjoy Julian Serrano (Aria) or Jaleo, two of the more upscale tapas restaurants in Las Vegas I was pleasantly surprised by Firefly.  Definitely having exceptional luck with off-the-strip dining experiences in Las Vegas this year (see previous review of Mint Indian Bistro, as well).
5	It took me a year to finally try this spot out! Ended up going here because wicked spoon is lame and closes at 2p n reopens at 5p -_- still love wicked spoon tho, but my sister told me over a year ago to eat at firefly. From the time she told me about it to the time I actually went I had been to vegas SIX times.  I thought by the time I actually tried Firefly I would be like "ehh its ok" coz I have been anticipating it for so long, but boy was I wrong. I ordered 4 tapas for myself. I got the ham and cheese croquette, firefly fries, sirloin burgers, and bacon wrapped dates. All were delicious. Apparently bacon wrapped dates are supposed to be the sh.t but when I tried, it was OK, kinda salty. If you want to try it share with 2 or 3 other people. Firefly is not too far away from the strip so you dont have to be concerned about sky high taxi fare. I really wish we had a fire fly in the bay but it gives me another reason to fly out to vegas!
5	The stuffed dates are really good! The desserts are good too and so is the service
5	I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner.
5	Excellent tapas.  Went with my wife, and were unexpectedly surprised with the quality of the food and service.  The wait was a little long, but worth it in the end.  Would definitely recommend, whether you're a local, or a tourist tired of the buffets and casinos.  We were only two, so it was hard to sample everything - but we will be back for more!
4	Our group of  6 came here on a Saturday night without making reservations so the wait was about 30 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad considering the place was really packed.  Our server was very attentive, as soon as we got seated  we ordered a couple pitchers of Sangria to start off with. The Sangria was good but it wasn't very strong.  while we waited they brought us a plate of bread with butter and some olives. We ordered about 5 or 6 plates off the menu to try.  We only waited about 20 minutes for the food to come out, was very impressed with how smoothly everything ran.  Now for the food, everything I tried was delicious! I ordered the manchego mac n' cheese which was a pretty small plate but it really delivered.  The paella was looking tempting and I immediately had to have more after a few bites of that.  I think the best thing I tried was the lamb, very tasty and it was so tender,   I feel like that was cooked to perfection.  I was very full after all of that but as Louis C.K. once said "I don't stop eating when I'm full, I stop eating when I hate myself" so the group was in full agreement we needed some desert to top the great meal off and someone was craving the nutella sandwiches so we ordered that and I'm glad we did. The bread was fluffy but  was also heated so it had a little crunch on the outside that I really loved and then you add on the smoothness of the nutella and you have me saying "I think my mouth is having an orgasm" The bill actually wasn't that large for everything we ordered, it's perfect for a small group or date. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that comes out to Vegas
1	I have heard so many great reviews about Firefly and ever since we moved here we wanted to try it. My wife and I watched one of those "stake out" reality shows that had Firefly on it and thought, oh we should go there and see how the guy changed the place.  What a let down.  I walk in and there are hostesses massaging bus boys and servers shoulders. We ask for a seat outside because the summer heat cooled a bit , we were given our menus and left out there for 7 minutes without even a drink order.  I went back inside to see what the hold up was and there were the hostesses and servers massaging each other and 4 servers just standing around. I asked if I could get a server to our table outside and everyone just raised their shoulders as to say, "I don't know". We went back outside and waited another 5 minutes... still no one.  So we left. Obviously all the problems that were supposed to be fixed on the TV show weren't.
5	Great place to eat. Trend setter, just behind the casino's on the east side, I like to take my friends here to eat and drink and to have a good time.
5	Wow!  My new obsession is trying new cuisine, and was not sure what to expect.   We tried a few things off the menu to maximize our experience.  The food was incredible!  So flavorful, the ambiance was just perfect, and the staff was wonderful.We started with their signature appetizer of bread and almond spread.  Then followed with the following:  Stuffed Dates, Crispy Duck Roll, Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and finished with the Banana Nutella Dessert.  I am sad that I live 3000 miles away, as this would be a weekly visit!   When in Vegas, check it out!  Recommended!
5	A party of four goes to Firefly on a Saturday evening to enjoy Tapas and Mojito's without reservations. Typically, this story would end in anger or disappointment; this story ends in pure joy.Firefly is by far the best Tapas I have had outside of Spain and one place in Seattle.The wait staff was perfect. Dishes were brought to the table and cleared away with expertise. Drinks and mojito pitchers were refilled quickly. The food, oh the food, was fabulous. There was only one dish out of about twenty (I wish that was an exaggeration) that we didn't love. We ate and drank until we were completely uncomfortable which is hard to do at a tapas restaurant. For us, this was the best food we had in Vegas.
5	Filet Mignon sliders and ceviche is to die for. We also love the fries with crumbles of cheese on them.  Always packed but for good reason.  Sangria pitchers make for a great meal.
4	Keep in mind that tapas are small dishes. But oh boy, waited too long to write this review (again). We have friends in Vegas this weekend (hot!) and I just reminded them to check out the Firefly on Paradise - can't vouch for any others!We had a group of 8 and ordered a different plate for each of us and ate them family style. Then we ordered more, ended up ordering 16 plates, which was too much food. All of them were OK, but a few were simply outstanding. I reluctantly tried a stuffed date - I usually don't like bacon on sweets - but that was one we ordered 2x! Also a shrimp dish. The mac and cheese and sausage plates were OK, but only ordered once. I'm getting old and waited too long to remember the rest. But just order a few and see what you like before ordering the additional plates.
5	Ay Caramba!!!!I Love This Place!!!!On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! Then came our drinks and tapas!I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.Now onto the tapas...Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!Happy Eats!
4	More like 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.  The service was great.  The food was alright, not amazing, but for sure a solid choice.  I am very thankful for this oasis that was still walking distance from The Strip.  Much better value for money!
5	Some of the best tapas I've ever eaten. Great prices, large menu, wonderful staff, etc. LOVED IT!!!!!!
5	Honestly the best place to eat in Vegas... and The best part ... it's NOT on the strip.  Whatever you order you will be impressed.  The wait for this place is sometimes one hr. and there's a reason for it.  Tuna Tar Tar, Steak Sliders and Dates and the apple salad.  I can go on for ever.  This is a LAS VEGAS Must Eat.
5	I don't know if you could even call this place a local secret anymore! If you haven't heard about it, GO TRY IT. You won't be disappointed. I used to live in Vegas years ago and the quality and consistency of the food hasn't changed at all. Yelp makes it easy for you too, order what everyone is raving about. There's a reason for that.It's Spanish tapas style food so bring your friends and order a bunch! I personally like the Manchego Mac n' Cheese, Filet Mignon Sliders, Duck rolls, Mussels, and the Tuna Tartare. BUT...If there is one thing that you MUST ORDER, get a pitcher (regardless of how thirsty you are) of the RED SANGRIA. You're welcome.They have their own parking lot but cab it if you're going to drink, use yelp to make reservations through Open Table, be hungry, blah blah blah whatever, just do the red sangria.
4	The secret is out, Firefly is a must go to place if you're living in Vegas or just visiting. If you're looking for a tapas place that is fun, hip and great for get togethers, you can't go wrong with Firefly. I've been here so many times, despite what my check in says, I'm a regular. At one point, I think I was obsess with this place. Anyway, I've been here for lunch-ish (2pm), dinner and late nights. I love, love, love that I can come here after work and have a great meal and some drinks. Everything on their menu is pretty much amazing. But here's my go to list. You can try them yourself or be adventurous and try something new. The top of the list is what I order every time I'm there and the bottom ones are ones I've tried and thought it was fantastic as well.Apple/manchego salad: Apple and cheese, a winer's delight. Crispy granny smith apples cut up like matchsticks paired with a nutty and salty flavorful manchego cheese. If you don't know what manchego cheese is, it's the spanish version of a parmesan cheese. It's nutty, definitely a little salty and often firm but not hard like a parm. Delicious is all you need to know. This is a salad that I have to have every time.Boquerones: Ahhhhhhhhhh, white anchovies, basil, bread, lemon, what else is there? Unlike regular anchovies, the white ones are milder in flavor, not salty and wonderfully yummy. Served on sliced baguette with basil and I think chili oil. Whatever, it's a reminder of tapas can be so fun and mouth watering. Great to dish to share, but I don't recommend it.Steamed mussel: Talk about calories. You're going to need to save the room for these. The broth that it comes in, make sure you save some bread because you're going to want to soak it up with it. It's creamy, buttery and a little bit curried. Veggie empanadas: Deep fired and packed with flavors. The meat ones are good, but I think the veggie ones are better.Big bowl of spinach salad: There's spinach, so it's healthy, right? Yes! you literally get a big bowl of this fresh salad that has obviously spinach and these roasted peppers, artichokes and fried onions and the dressing that just ties is all together.Bacon wrapped dates: Sweet and salty and topped with a little bleu cheese is all I need to say. But you need to eat them as soon as they arrive because they're not as good when they're cold and the bacon gets hard.Patron peppers: Great little peppers to have on the side. Most of the are mild but if you get lucky or unlucky to some, you'll get one that really packs some heat. There's too much to say here. Just get out and try it because it's a must try spot for everyone. And don't forget to get a drink with that, especially the sangria. Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)
5	I've tried to keep this my little secret since 2010.. This is the one and only mandatory restaurant when I'm in the area, mainly for 3 things: sparking sangria, paella, and the creamy dip and olives with garlic bread you get when you are seated. RECOMMENDATIONS (why I give this place 5 stars):Sparkling sangria- heaven's gift for sangria lovers who like a fruitier, fizzier and lighter version of the drink. $7 a glass or $28 a pitcher. Paella- the best I've had up to date (and I've tried many in SF). The amount of saffron is usually perfect, very savory with a bit of sour, and there is always a generous amount of seafood, chicken and sausage. The rice is soft, chewy and well-spiced. Filet mignon sliders- the boyfriend's favorite. These are mini burgers with medium-rare beef and the most amazing cheese sauce, Fried caramelized onions on the side.Steamed mussels- a big plate of mussels bathed in a delicious wine sauce.Garden variety salad- so fresh and bursting with flavors of feta cheese, orange and dried cherries with vinaigrette. The baby beet salad and warm spinach salad are really good as well. OTHER NOTES:Baked filets of tilapia- way too sour but if you like a heavy lemon taste with several slices of healthy fish, go for it. Crispy duck roll- not recommended, super salty. Leave the "hoisin" sauce to Asian places.Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms- five cute little bite-size mushrooms that don't particularly wow me, but the boyfriend likes the taste combination. I have heard that the stuffed dates are well-liked.. will try next time.I love that Firefly is consistent in its service, presentation and quality for the items I like to order. Also, this place is completely reasonably-priced for what it offers.
5	In Vegas for the weekend, and decided to get off the strip for dinner Saturday night.  Best.  Choice.  Ever.  We weren't super-hungry coming in, but I wish we had been!  Next time I know to fast for a day or two so I can try more than 3 dishes!We ordered:Gazpacho - solid dish, great croutons/avocado on top, nice texture and flavor.  At most other restaurants, this would have blown me out of the water (and it did, until I tried the other 2 dishes....)Ceviche - YUM. YUM. YUM.  Great lime-iness, nice texture on the shrimp.  I used the bread to soak up the rest of the broth.  Heaven!Thai Beef Salad - I will order this again and again and again (assuming I make it back to Vegas).  This salad was perfection!  The beef was tender and flavorful, and the other salad ingredients were so perfectly balanced.  The dressing was soy/salsa verde-based and I also soaked this up with bread.  I can't stop thinking about it.Service was great, food came out fast (probably helped that we ordered 2 cold dishes and a salad) but we didn't feel rushed in the least.  Arrived around 8 pm on Saturday, put out names in for what we were told would be a 45 minute wait, came back 30 minutes later and were seated immediately.  Fun & funky atmosphere without it feeling like they were trying too hard.  Basically, I was impressed as soon as I walked in and the food only increased my opinion of this place.  Check it out, for sure.The 3 dishes above, plus the complimentary bread/olives/spread (WHAT WAS IN THAT??  It was sooo yummy), plus 2 beers only set us back $30 + tip.
5	So I went on a Yelp'ing frenzy on my last Vegas trip since I did more eating out than I did partying and sleeping. It's usually hard to find tapas bars in Orange County, or at least ones I like eating at. So when I came upon this one in Vegas, I debated on writing to the owner and having them consider getting one out in Orange County...like really. I highly recommend you come here, bring a couple friends, grab a couple glasses of sangria, order a couple of dishes, order a couple of more, and then have yourself a darn good time. Bacon wrapped dates...very few places have these, only one other place (in Whittier, CA...) ties with this place on this dish. This is currently my newest addiction...I have no idea what it is about this savory-sweet combo that gets me every time, but it does...Also get the firefly fries and the tierra y mar skewers...flavors that'll leave you wanting more, like a good strip tease. Next Vegas trip, I'm heading straight for this place for more yummy!
4	My girl friends and I must have ate Firefly's kitchen out.  We had 10 tapas and a pan of paella for lunch before, of course, dropping our guts at Encore Beach Club.  Sexy! The paella is an absolute must-have for $20 (Toto, I've a feeling we're not in San Francisco anymore!).  It was chock-full of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, and chorizo--I couldn't believe there was more seafood than saffron rice.  My favorite small plates were the camarones a la diabla (shrimp in spicy chile sauce), stuffed dates, and chorizo clams.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked in a delectable sauce--after we had all the shrimp, we hung on to the sauce and smothered anything and everything with it.  The dates were small, though tasty and complex.   The clams were in a lighter sauce than the shrimp but also delicious simmered in chorizo and white wine. I would skip the roasted baby beet salad, tortilla a la Espanola (Spanish omelette), and the lobster escargots.  There were barely any beets in the salad; the tortilla not only looked but tasted unappetizing; and the lobster escargots were so small I can't even remember their taste.I've had paella and tapas in Spain and at many memorable restaurants in the US.  Firefly doesn't come close to the top, but the prices are so reasonable (for Vegas!) and the selection is so vast (even the pickiest of eaters can't whine!) that I have to bump this 3-star tapas bar to 4 stars.  Plus, it's nice to leave the Strip for a meal!
5	I was here on a Friday night July 13th with my hubby and another couple.  This place was BUSY, but our 30 minute wait wasn't bad.  When they seated us, we had to walk out of the restaurant and went next door, the 2 rooms didn't connect.  Parking here was easy, it has a decent parking lot since it's inside a retail strip.  The service was good, our food and drinks were brought our accordingly, no long wait.  The food (small plates) was excellent, some of the plates were actually bigger than what I thought it would be. The salads are definitely a decent size for small plates.  Anything shrimp was awesome.  We had a lot, I don't remember exactly what we ordered. The stuff dates were good but a little on the sweet side.  The shrimp tempura was excellent, not like the ones you get from the sushi restaurants. It's lightly battered and had a wonderful taste, included fried green onions and potatoes I think.  The claims were good, season just right.  The thai beef salad had almost a bland taste to it but then you hit a hot chilli pepper and the spice kicked right in. I didn't try their tapas, what it's known for but the others said it's good.  We ordered so much more  and most of the items we ordered are good.  There is one octopus dish that was ok, wasn't the greatest.  Overall, price wise (about $200 including many many drinks) was decent for 4 people.  I would go back here again and again when I go to Vegas, this is my must hit place.
3	So I should start off with saying that my husband and I could not afford the 3 to 4 thousand minimums on the strip for our wedding reception. I had been to the firefly before and liked the food enough and the vibe enough. So the good, I live in Seattle and I am privilege to really amazing food. If you live in Seattle and you make a decent living a month you also know what good food is and likely don't even realize how good you are eating because you take for granted how fresh and local everything is. So yeah, we chose tapas. It was good. They had some really great and delicious items but it was not amazing by any means but then again nothing I ate in Vegas was amazing. I am convinced that amazing food is very difficult to come by in a desert.  So the food was better than anything we had eaten in Vegas but by no means amazing. The service was o.k. People waited  longer for drinks than I would have liked them too considering we booked this six months in advance. Our space was cramped, at the back of the restaurant in a corner. A bit more space even two or three inches between tables would have made moving about easier. They did however allow us to bring in an Elvis impersonator at no additional charge. That was awesome. We had ordered a lovely cake from a local bakery that we were charged per head for yet when the cake was brought out it was obviously straight from the walk in and the frosting was cold and hard. We brought the remaining cake back to the hotel with us and were able to fully appreciate how delicious it was once it was at a warmer temp the next day. Firefly was an ok pick for being on a budget, however if we would have had a few extra K to spend for a reception we would have taken the party elsewhere. It was not great neither bad. It is close to the strip.
3	Solid tapas, great service and amazing prices!  We liked the food but did not have anything that knocked us over (anchovies, grilled octopus, baby beet salad, meatballs, Tiera y Mar skewers).  Good sangria.  Good option if you want to get away from all the chains filling Vegas.
5	We listen to fellow Yelpers and I'm glad we did!!! This place was SO GOOD!!! I don't know if it's because I got 12 different dishes but every single plate I got was tasty hot and fresh!!! This is what we ordered and 4-6 steak and mushrooms!! So please try steak and mushroom when you try this place.. We will def be back. The service was fast so that always was a plus. Always had a server by our table if we ever needed anything. Refilled out drinks consistently.... Thanks Yelpers for the great recommendation !!! U def made up for some of the past ones.. Ha
5	Finally tried this place for the first time, missed happy hour by about 10 minutes and really wanted to kick myself in the butt for that, but the tapas selection and variety were delicious. Tried some of the seafood, beef skewers, lamb, and bacon wrapped dates. Everything came out delicious and very quick. The sangria is very tasty as well, although the only fruit pieces in it were diced apples. Next time I will have to make sure to get here for happy hour.
4	Firefly was very good and some dishes were great.   A fun dining experience off the Strip. Ambiance - 4 starsHipster.  But, very noisy and ice-cold AC inside.  So, we opted to sit outside, which was fine at 10pm Service - 3 starsThe server was very timely initially, but then they seemed to forget about us as the meal progressed.Drinks - 2 starsThe Mojito & Margaritas were far too sweet and took forever to arrive.Food - Menu Variety - 5 starsAmazing choices (perhaps too many!)  ;-)Stuffed dates - 5 stars"Dance Party" in your mouth with bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  Amazing!Ham & Cheese Croquetas - 3 starsWhile good (and recommended by the server), it was just too rich & creamy to fully appreciate the Serrano Ham & Manchego CheeseSteak & Mushroom Skewers - 4 starsGrilled filet, roast garlic cream & red wine reduction.  There was quite a lot of meat, which was tender & tasty.  The sauce, while good, was a bit bland.Beet Salad - 3 starsIt had all the proper components, beets, tender greens, nuts & feta cheese.  But, it was also somewhat bland.Overall, Firefly was good and we might try it again with another group of friends.
4	Yummy tapas for sure! My hubby and I really really like this place. We have been there 3 times in the past month to just have some drinks away from the kids and enjoy a snack while chatting. It is always a pleasure to come here and we get treated well each time by a friendly staff. The table however was not really clean that well the last time we came but that is my only issue.
4	I have been to firefly probably about 10 times in the past few years.  Usually its for the pitchers of sangria and the company of some good friends.  I rarely go there to serve my palate with a delectable array of dishes.  HOWEVER!  This happened, and below is my experience.First of all, dumb me, did not realize that there was a huge other section of this restaurant.  I only ever sat in the tiny -ass room with the bar.  Yeah, dumb me.  Anyway the main room is nice!Things you should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order at firefly: bacon-wrapped dates, and the sangria.  White or red doesnt matter, you NEED to get the sangria.  It's the best sangria I've ever had.  A pitcher of it will run you $28 or similar.  get it.  Anyway, also get the mushroom and steak skewers, super juicy and well-flavored.Things to not get:  They have this dish called patatas flavas.  It's diced potatoes covered with some sort of sauce.  I wasn't a fan, it was greasy and the sauce was weird.I don't think I would go here for an actual meal again, just because those potatoes left a horrible taste in my mouth. I'll probably go to just munch on some delicious dates and drink the...what was it?  Sangria.  OH! I almost forgot that our waiter forgot us.  At least that's what it felt like.  But this place gets poppin' (I can't believe I just typed that) on the weekends so he did get super busy.
4	Again, one of my favorite meals in vegas.  We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table for two on friday night to get a seat, which is to be expected.  We got about 7 tapas for the two of us.  As many others have stated, get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates, they are very good.  I've been here before and I think I liked the food this time around better.  The other thing with tapas places, I've felt that I'm not getting value for my money typically, but this was $62 including tip for two, and 7 plates and 1 dessert, no drinks (just water).  I thought this was pretty good.  As far as service, it was ok.  I am picky about making sure my drinks are refilled consistently.  I waited a while the first time, and then just asked the server to leave a pitcher of water, so I really didn't have to wait the rest of the meal. Overall, I would recommend checking this place out.
3	Tried this place last night. It was packed and although my friends and I enjoyed all the food overall, there were some serious service snafus. Our server was hurried and not at all on top of it. He should have had some help, as he made a couple of serious mistakes. I ordered a glass of cabernet and my partner asked for chardonnay. Almost every restaurant automatically serve the 'house' or lowest price wine when someone orders a glass of cab etc. Our server did not. He took it upon himself to substitute a glass that was 3 times the price of the house wine (the portion of wine was also very small, like 4 ounces). When the check arrived I tried to find the manager, and a hostess finally foind him outside. He was nice enough  and said he would fix the check. He reduced the  wine portion from $48 to $24, still $4 more than it should have been. Our server managed a poor apology and told me he was too busy and simply made a mistake. Hmmmm. Not buying it. Another note, get rid of the crappy, loud piped in Spanish music and add  some air conditioning,thr restaurant atmosphete made us all want to leave asap. So food 4 stars, service 2 stars.
5	Best tapas place in Las Vegas and probably in most places I've been to.  Love the seafood paella (I had them put the sausage and beef bits on the side).  The tilapia was good if you like it lemony.  If you don't like it to be too zesty, you can always ask them to put less lemon slices, or have them on the side.  My friend raved about his mac and cheese, which disappeared in his mouth in less than 3 minutes.  It's also opened late too which was a plus!
5	i cant say anything different than anyone else has besides oh god i miss those dates like my cross country grandmother.and the sangria was nice but i knew better than to drink too much...sweet!by far the most inspired and worthwhile meal i had while in las vegas.
5	Amazing! Artichoke Toast was my favorite!
4	Really good, of course we just got in town and avis didn't have the compact car we requested so we got a 2013 mustang at the same rate, so this might be exagerated. Bacon almond dates are amazing. Pulpa is cooked well but needs a sauce. Lamb was tasty. If anything, do yourself a favor and order a pitcher of sangria. Gonna have to go to the one in LA to compare. Looked like their happy hour is where it's at and any time you can get of the strip its well worth it.
5	I think I've been here twice in the past month and I am ready to come back to nom again very soon.  For a big guy like me, I usually prefer "healthy" sized meals in comparison to a plethora of small entrees to pick from.  But, Firefly seems to get me every time.  From the Camarones a la Diabla to the Tuna Tartare, all of the dishes ordered at Firefly seem to continually hit the spot.  Plus, they have a nice malbec on the menu at a nice price.  What more can I ask for??  Actually, I would ask for a decrease in the hustle-n-bustle and a little more of a quieter atmosphere.. but when everyone else is enjoying it just as much as I am.. well, I can't do too much about that now can I?Definitely coming back to grub here soon.. make sure to try out the Camarones a la Diabla (the sauce is bangin'!) and the Passionfruit Cheesecake when you stop by!
5	Loved the food and service.- Bacon wrapped dates are a must have! - Same for the Kobe beef sliders that come with that delish chipotle aioli. - The garlic butter and bread were a cherry on top. Our server was kind enough to replace our drinks which weren't on par with our expectations and the replacements were amazing! Great spot right off the strip if you want to have great food and alcohol for a reasonable price.
5	My favorite go to place for tapas when in Las Vegas.......Bacon wrapped dates (as many mention) are the best...So many great tapas - We love to get some drinks; enjoy looking at the menu; and then deciding on what great tapas to have this go around....Too bad the place is so far from home for me - but when in the area its our go to place for tapas....Firefly is the best! And I like the sangria -  just writing this makes me happy!Next trip already planned - Firefly I'll see you soon!
5	Hands down best tapas I've ever had !!
3	All the tapas I've had are good.  The sangria is also good.  The place can be very noisy so don't go if you're looking for an intimate dinner.
5	Who would of known that there is an AMAZING Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas? Firely is located off the strip but well worth the trip. As we enter, it was dark and social with latin jams blasting in the background.  I was starting to dig this place!To get the party started, I order the sangria and mojito. Both drinks were TERRIFIC! Don't judge me it's VEGAS! There were so many tapa dishes to choose from. The bacon wrapped figs, tierra y mar skewer, crispy duck rolls and tuna tartar were incredible. The filet mignon sliders and mac n cheese was outstanding. Each tapas dish ranges from $4-$8. I would definitely be back here on my next trip to Vegas!
5	This place is mmm mmm good. This was my first tapas experience and I loved it. I came here with a couple other people so we were able to order a few things and share them. We got the Mac n cheese, calamari, parmesan fries, and a baked pepper. I didn't try the calamari because I'm not a big seafood person, but everything else was very good, especially the fries. We came in at the beginning of happy hour so we were able to participate in the drink specials which we were also delicious. This place is definitely worth a try, and I can't wait to go back.
5	I love this place....there is nothing better than getting to try lots of different items for a great price
5	I absolutely love this place!!  I have experienced both sitting inside at the bar as well as eating outside in the summer. Today I sat at the bar and they had three bartenders on staff. I ordered the warm spinach salad, bacon wrapped dates and the mini filet sliders. All very good :) I will be back.
5	If you're in Vegas with a party of 4 or more, you've got to check this place out.I've made it a point to try and eat at least once off of the strip on each Vegas trip.  Located about 1 mile East of the strip by Sands Blvd (By Palazzo).  The prices are a bit more reasonable, and you'll find some real gems like this Firefly joint.  Tell your cabbie "Firefly on Paradise" and they'll know where to go.I don't think they take reservations for weekends, so we arrived early for dinner and had no wait being seated for 6 + a baby.  Also great for lunch I'm sure.Here's the menu: http://www.fireflylv.com/menu.htmlBesides one dish that was a bit sweet for my palate (I think it was the duck in cherry hoisin), I pretty much loved every dish.  I recommend trying the foreign things because they'r likely really good and that's the fun of foodie adventures.The must trys are:-Paella... good volume, generous seafood portions, and the goodness absorbed into the rice (plus, paella is the epitome of tapas)-Chorizo Clams... the white wine chorizo sauce for dipping bread is magic!-Sparking sangria (fruit-infused for 3-days)-Pulpo Asado (marinated and grilled ocotpus)The forego your first trip are:-Tortilla Espanola (potatoes seemed a bit underdone)The GF thought the flavors had a recurring theme of tomatoes and garlic, but I thought each dish was pretty dynamic.The ambiance isn't very intimate, but there was no rush and the service was attentive and knowledgeable.  This is a great place to catch up with friends or family and share small plates of good Spanish tapas with a cold sangria or red wine.
5	Love love love firefly....bacon wrapped dates...has been amazing food everytime i have been there.... The service was ok...will definately go back...always great for a party!!!
5	THIS IS A MUST GO! It is worth the drive off the strip. The food is DELICIOUS and the prices are really reasonable. The bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese are a MUST and the baby back ribs are also AMAZING. The white Sangria is also to die for! I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.
5	Firefly catered my Husband's birthday party at an off site location. Great quality for the price. Everyone was pleased. Regina was very helpful and Sandy was great too.
5	If you haven't tried this place you must!  Everything is good, but I had the bacon wrapped dates which were amazing!  Happy hour at the bar is fun as they give you little appetizers.  Totally recommend it but it does get busy.
4	Eating at Firefly was one of the highlights of my Vegas trip! We went on a Wednesday night around 8pm without a reservation and were seated at the bar while we waited. In general I'm a huge fan of food that's easy to share, so I was predisposed to love the restaurant. Ambient lighting that wasn't so dim you couldn't see the other members of your party, and the noise level was decent.My friend and I had:- stuffed dates: as many have mentioned, these bacon-wrapped things are beyond delicious! I'm iffy on dates and love bacon, and found the dish to be just the right amount of sweet- firefly fries: we were hungry and wanted something more filling. These fries seem like a much classier (and possibly marginally healthier) version of your standard cheese fries. They tasted great, but I might have ordered something different if I was less desperately hungry while ordering. - mushroom tart: pastry was fluffy and crisp, mushrooms and sauce were well-made. Felt more like a breakfast food than a dinner dish, but I didn't mind.- chorizo clams: unexpected combination, but delicious! My friend's favorite dish of the night. I think it came with around a dozen clams and a heaping pile of sausage-y sauce.I wish we had come with more people so we could have tried more dishes!
4	It has been quite awhile since I've been to Firefly.. Usually there is a long wait for dinner seating, especially on a weekend, but today I went with a girlfriend for lunch.  Ah, this is the way to do it! No wait, seated right away near the window.  Instead of getting tapas, today I finally tried the paella.  I'm really glad that I did!!! It was absolutely delicious- filled with all kinds of meats, saffron rice, and a huge (dinner sized) portion.  It was $20, which is a little high for lunch, but would have easily cost double that at a restaurant on the Strip.I had a decent mango mojito (very heavy on the mint), and service was pleasant and brisk.The AC seemed to be struggling a bit, especially with the bright sunlight streaming through the windows, but the staff lowered the blinds, which helped quite a bit.I do prefer the W. Sahara location aesthetically, but the original Firefly still is a good choice!
4	You know I do love tapas. Ever since Cha Cha Cha in SF, I've been crazy for tapas. After the many good reviews from Firefly, I came here with two friends to try it out. We wanted to order everything but tried to limit it to what we could eat. So we ordered:Lobster Escargot. A little on the mushy side. Portion is small. I'm warning you now so that you don't have a shock face like I did when I saw it. There's about five pieces. Good start to the food though.Filet Mignon Sliders. This was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Slight pink on the inside and juicy. There was also crispy onions on the side and along with two sliders. The aioli in the slider was a definite ingredient that separated Firefly's sliders from other places. Stuffed Mushroom. Chicken was a bit dry but I like mushrooms so I'm getting it anyways. Came in four pieces.Camarones Al Ajillo. About 6 medium sized shrimps and one hell of an amazing sauce. The shrimps were not mushy. The sauce went perfect with the bread given. Got to impress me with sauce when I go to tapas eateries.Along with our $30 pitcher of watermelon mojito which had Bacardi rum in it yet did not taste as strong as I thought it would, My friends and I were still a bit hungry. So we went and order the Paella. Not the best I've had. The rice a bit overcooked but the ingredients in here is absolutely worth your money. The seafood were plentiful and more than the average selection at other restaurants. Our total bill was about $90. We were full after for our party of 3. The restaurant is not too big and it's off the strip of Las Vegas. However, very much worth coming. Service was attentive, had no problem with it. It's located in a plaza so there is also lots of parking.
5	Let me start off with MY only complaint: it was a little loud for my taste. My wife said its just cause I'm getting old as we were celebrating my 35th this past Friday in Vegas. But I'm a talker, and I like to talk and hear myself talk and the people I'm talking with talk, and the music playing made that a little difficult. With that being said, there is nothing else to complain about. So if you like a more quiet, intimate vibe, this isn't gonna be a spot you'll like.So for those of you that don't know, tapas are small appetizer plates. In fact, most of the plates are no bigger than the size of the bowls most Mexican restaurants put salsa in. Don't expect big portions. These bite-sized Spanish appetizer plates are only a mere fraction of the size of a typical American app. Thus, if you are a big eater, you might want to order more than a couple. Or, go in decent group and share, as our party of 8 did.When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be a 40-minute wait. We didn't complain because they had misters outside, which was very refreshing in the Las Vegas heat. We decided to go to the bar while we waited instead so that we could try the sangria everyone keeps talking about here on Yelp. Hands down, the best sangria I've had in a while. Better than the sangria they serve at Buca di Beppo, which was my favorite until I tasted the deliciousness of this red wine and fruity goodness! Twenty minutes into our wait, we were seated and expertly attended to. Service here is impeccable. We didn't have to ask for anything and they were quick with all our orders.Moving on to our food, this is what we ordered and shared:Stuffed dates- date wrapped in bacon, smoked almond, blue cheese and served in a red wine reduction. Winner all around. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese and I loved these! Portion size is about 4 or 5 dates. I'd highly recommend them.Chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms- no explanation needed. Smokey chorizo flavor enhanced the earthiness of the mushroom and was nice on the chicken too.Filet mignon sliders- moist, juicy, tender and if that flavor could be duplicated in a normal size burger, they'd run out of it everyday!Lobster escargot- don't let the name fool you. No snails here. Just little balls of lobster tail meat in a garlic herb butter, and perfectly grilled.Camarones a la diabla- just like the Mexican version, not as spicy. Very flavorful.Baked filets of tilapia- herbs, lemon and garlic. Melt in your mouth white fish. Shrimp temura- beer battered, very crispy.Tierra y Mar skewers- grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo and salsa Verde. All cooked to perfection, all compliment each other.Ribeye steak entree- 14 oz. ribeye in a red wine sauce, topped with cabrales cheese. Outstanding steak on its own. Tender, tasty, no A-1 needed.Overall, make room for eating here while in Vegas. Unanimously vote on as being g a place to come back to on our next trip.
5	Amazing food and Sangria. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, lamb chops, and the garlic shrimp. Make reservations if you want to get seated quickly.
5	I rate this place 4/5, but my husband gives it a 5/5. For starters, the complimentary bread is addictive! For the entrees, my husband ordered the stuffed dates and the filet mignon sliders and thought both were fabulous. The food was hot, tasteful, and the presentation was nice. I ordered the the only entree salad on the menu (with avocado), and loved it. It was heavily tossed in dressing, so request lightly tossed if you don't like your lettuce drenched. This place isn't known for its salad, so I won't complain. The energy level and ambiance are super nice, and the service was top notch. Full of locals - I think we were the only tourists, so that tells me they have a round of regulars. Good sign. Great place.
5	I loved this place!!!  My girls and I came here when we were in Vegas.  We had a group of 13 and they were sooooo accommodating.  We got our table on time, we got the food quickly, and we had a ton of fun!  The waiters were extremely friendly and interacted with us--which made dinner a lot more fun.  All of the tapas were flavorful, and my favorite part, it was not expensive at all!  I highly recommend.
5	We opted to get off the strip for our reception on Saturday.  My best friend, who just moved to North Las Vegas, suggested this place and I'm so glad she did.  We booked a private room and had the two hour open bar.  Everything was just amazing.  They brought out the white and red sangria (sadly I didn't get to try the white) as well as a couple of different mojitos.  The blood orange mojito was amazing.  And at the risk of sounding like a broken record, everything was amazing.  We opted for the bacon wrapped dates (of course), chicken and beef skewers (the beef were the better of the two...super tender), spicy potatoes (good but there was almost too many of them), the albondigas.  The chocolate tres leches cake at the end was the perfect cap.  They also brought the entire party of 16 shots of their infused vodka.  And the service all around was just amazing.  They kept asking us if there was anything we needed and they were not stingy with the drinks in the least, even bringing out extra glasses so people could start double fisting!  :)I wish they would open up a spot in Denver or Colorado Springs...this place is amazing!
5	cant say enough LOVE this place a little packed on the weekends wish the would take reservations...but worth the wait from the food to the sangria NO complaints located near the strip
5	Everything we tried was deeeeeeelish ! And everything else on the menu sounded equally as yummy.Service was friendly, although a tad unattentive. But they were so busy, it's understandable.Definitely coming back next time we're in town! Totally worth going that mile off the strip. (;
3	It's a fun place to go. I love sharing my food family style so this place is great for me. The dishes we chose were hit and miss, though. An eggplant and goat cheese dish had the eggplant so thin, it was overwhelmed by the 90% cheese portion. An egg/potato/something else dish was very... potatoey, though what was I expecting from it huh? Filet mignon and Thai beef salad were delicious though. Glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't return.
5	Delicious food! Awesome service! Nice atmosphere!
4	Paella, pitcher of legit sangria, a few other small plates (all of which were good) and it was the best end to our Vegas vacay.
5	I am not going to BS with the review, if you are giving this place anything less than a 5 star you are hating.  Unless you can find me a place that provides the same quality food and cheaper or higher quality with the same price.  This place deserve to be the only place I know with 1000+reviews with a solid 5 stars.  Quick tip you can impress girls here, tell her you will take her off the strip and then take her back to your hotel....
4	Food was outstanding.Wine glass was dirty, but service was superb. I will return ASAP
5	One of the best tapas restuarants I've been to.  My second favorite is the Firefly in Summerlin.I like the overall ambience here.  Everyone mingling and everyone having a good time. This place can bring you at ease. You almost feel like you're in a club in this location.  This location get's pretty busy compared to the Summerlin location. So, expect a lot of people, but don't expect to wait. I've never had to wait to be seated at this place. Whether you're visiting or local, you have to try Firefly at least once. This a great place to hang out with friends, take a date or significant other, mistress, and even some co-workers to relieve some work related stress.  But I wouldn't suggest this place if you're taking the family out or if you're by yourself.  I've been to this location about 4 times and the Summerlin location 2 times.  Almost everytime, there's a group or single person not handling their liquor well.  My Suggestions:Artichoke ToastMac N CheeseThe Skewers: Forgot the name but has shrimp, filet mignon, and some porkFried Calamari:  Not uncommon for us to order extraChicken SkewersPetite FiletStuff MushroomsAll the portions are small and very inexpensive.  You can come out of here spending very little.  The drinks will cost you more than the food. The experience...priceless.
5	cant wait to go again while in Vegas!!!!!!!! then we went to .Wait i cant tell you becasue what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!!1
5	Everything was so delicious, and my mouth waters as I think about the shrimp in garlic sauce! Everything sounded soo enticing on the menu, though I know from experience that I shouldn't order more than I know I could eat. In addition to the shrimp (I can't remember the name, sorry!), the tuna tartare was amazing! To accompany the tuna, were some taro chips which perfectly complimented the tuna and avocado. The only thing that I felt was a little "meh" was the filet mignon sliders. Don't get me wrong, it was really good. However, it was just ok compared to everything else that we ordered.
4	try the wrapped dates!! sooooooo good. a bit pricey, but worth it.
5	great food.  great service.Red sangria pitcher and tuna skewers!
5	The best Tapas restaurant I have ever been to. I make it a point to come here every trip to Vegas. Oct 26th can't come soon enough!!
1	This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. The 45 minute wait to be seated to eat didnt bother me until I understood why. We (a group or five people-average) saw our waiter maybe two times while we were seated. The waiter was so unorganized he skipped taking my wife's order and she had to wait until the food that was previously ordered was all gone to place her order (with the missing waiter). After my wife received her order and she finished eating, we then had to wait well over 20 minutes for the check. We all walked out assuming the check was paid, but to my surprise it wasn't, they chased me down in the parking lot and the first thing that was said out of the servers mouth was, "I'm going to call the police if you dont give me your ID", what happened to "Sir, I'm sorry but the check was not paid". I spoke to the manager about the lack there of attention of his server, and his response was, "oh".For a restaurant with so many positive reviews, I find it hard to believe that we were the lucky or unlucky people to enjoy the wonderful food and experience (based on other reviews on yelp) the Las Vegas Firefly.As far as the food, I was sick shortly after leaving this location; but next time if I want to wait in line and be sick after eating I'll venture to the the Mc Donald's at the local Walmart for fried food.
5	One of the best Tapas restaurants I've ever been to. Was visiting and was recommended this place by multiple locals and am glad we took the trip off the Strip to come here.Prices were great, especially when compared against any place on the Strip and the ambience was phenomenal, this would be a great place to bring a date. Food was outstanding as well I would highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates (what they are known for) as well as the merguez, but honestly everything we tried was great.Sangria (we had the red) was good, but not outstanding. Overall, I would highly recommend Firefly to anyone living or visiting Vegas.
4	Great off the strip tapas restaurant.  Waited over an hour on an early Saturday night but the food was worth it!  Everything we ordered was good (and we practically ordered everything on the menu for a group of 7). Note:  the portions are bigger than traditional tapas servings...we ordered 2 of everything all at once PLUS paella, and we had WAY WAY too much food.  I suggest you order a few at a time.  Unanimous group favorite was the Ahi Tuna Skewers. Ordered a pitcher of Blood Orange Mojito (meh) and a pitcher of Red Sangria (yum).  This is a great place for a fun group outing (as long as you're willing to wait) but don't go here on a first date unless you want to shout at each other the whole night!We'll be back for sure!!!
5	I am a huge fan of Firefly and have yet to have a bad experience. I tried the tomato bisque soup for the first time, and DAMN i have been missing out! It was delicious!! Bacon wrapped dates, ham and cheese croquetas are a must! All the sangrias are yummy too. The service is fast and attentive. Even when the restaurant is packed and there is a line out the door, the servers are attentive and don't rush you to eat and leave. Both locations are amazing!
4	So I was drunk when we were hear, and memory is an issue, but I really think I judged the food well :) haha!! I loved the bacon dates, the achovies on bread, the steak kabobs, the lamb kabobs, oh crap, I can't remember what else, but I liked everything (a lot), the only thing I didn't love was the apple salad.. it was ok... coulda used a little dressing or honey... The atmosphere was nice, the waiter was very cool, the food came fast... GREAT price for such good food, I will be back for sure!!
5	In a town where people want to rip you off... Firefly consistently undercharges and overdelivers.  Just go.  Don't think twice.  It's a super super awesome good time.
5	Yum!  kinda divey but the food was excellent.  I was in town for a conference and I met up with a friend whom I haven't seen in almost 8 years.  So it was cool to catch up and after spending some time at Red Rock Canyon, we decided to grub it up here.It's a tapas place, and damn I love tapas.  I am all about variety.  Variety is the spice of life as I'm sure you've heard.  I like tapas and small plates in general because you get to try a little bit of everything.  If you really like something, then order more!Better than buffets, generally, since  the food is made to order.I specifically remember the ahi tuna dish.  The anchovy bread was also tasty.  Honestly I don't remember everything cause I tend to just order like I'm shooting flies in a barrel.  Is that the correct reference?  I don't remember.Anyway, if I go back to LV, I'll go back here.  For sure.
4	This was probably the best food I had over my 4 day stay in Vegas. We eat on the strip and off. We ordered 6 different dishes and only one did not impress us. That was the Papatas Bravas (roasted potatoes). They were bland and needed some kind of sauce. As a vegetarian my favorite dish was the Veggies and Lentils while my boy's favorite dish was a tie between the ribs and the bacon wrapped dates. We will definitely be back to explore more of the menu! Ps... sit on the patio!
5	I have had tapas only twice in my life, and both of those times have been in this restaurant. It's SO GOOD! Come in with a group and order lots of little plates to share, along with a pitcher of sangria or two :) I don't remember all the dishes I've had here, but I would recommend ANYTHING on their menu. I seriously think the second time I went here, I just randomly pointed at things on the menu that sounded good, and they all exceeded my high expectations (from the first visit). So yeah, I can't recommend specific dishes because I like them ALL.
5	I love this place! This is the thrid time I have been to this location and it has yet to disappoint me. The one in summerlin just doesn't compare to this one, but I never get anything here that I don't like. Love the bacon wrapped dates and the mac and cheese really surprised me too. Can't ever go wrong with the red wine sangria either. Great atmosphere, good service, will continue to keep this as a top fIve on my list.
3	first tappas bar experience but Ive known about them for a while and had high expectations for this place after seeing the reviews.  However of our 4 different dishes, none impressed :(Lobster bites was good (how can you mess up lobster lol) but nothing spectacular and not worth the price in our opinion)exact same feelings for the Shrimp tempura, which was more crispy strings than shrimp.Chicken chorizo was a disappointment, we made bootleg stuffed mushrooms mixing in whatever we had in the fridge that came out better than these.I couldnt really eat the slidders since they had a sauce on it that Im picky about but wife said they were good, not special.
4	Off the strip and to my recollection, the first time I've eaten at a LV restaurant with a very diverse crowd ( ie Gay, Straight). The atmosphere is drak, colorful, salsa music playing loudly- its a great place. The food makes it really cool. Bacon wrapped dates, savory chicken skewers and a delicious even cooked calamari. Fries were spot on, the sangria was good. Good place
5	This place is always packed for good reason!  The plates might be small, but the flavors are gargantuan.  Their best selling dish is the stuffed dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese), in fact they're so popular the kitchen never stops preparing them during operating hours.  They practically arrive before you can finish saying the word dates.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if there is some unique baseball-esque eye/hand signal that the servers flash the kitchen to notify another order of dates has been placed.One of my other staples is the granny smith apple & manchego salad (green apples, manchego cheese, smoked almonds, lightly dressed).  We tried the roasted eggplant cannelloni for the first time and oh my, this is an instant favorite; it's thin slices of eggplant stuffed with generous amounts of goat cheese in a light tomato sauce.  The best values are: 1) the large portion of Firefly fries for $6, which come generously spiced with parmesan and herbs & a delectable aioli dipping sauce and 2) the steamed mussels @ $8 are swimming in a giant bowl of red curry, white wine, coconut cream broth Their drinks are bangin!!  I love the house-infused vodka (with berries and lychee), which makes for an absolutely amazing martini, but watch out because it packs a strong punch despite the deceptively delicious flavor.  The pear-ginger martini is another winner, as well as the sangria pitchers with fresh fruit afloat.  The don't accept reservations during high traffic times.  Even when they tell you that there is a wait, it is never long.  This is one hot spot that you can believe ALL of the hype.  It's all that and then some.  The only word of caution is that it is easy to get carried away with ordering and tasting, and before you know it you can accrue a thriving tab!
3	I give it 3.5 stars only because I have been to lots of tapas places and have had better food.Maybe in Vegas this is the best place for Tapas?It was ok. Good food. Nothing great. If I lived here would probably not come back.
5	Firefly is a tapas restaurant; I had no idea what that meant the first time I was there.  Upon arrival I realized it was just a punch of small dishes you could order in order to make your perfect meal; Wikipedia has it described as "are a wide variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine"  to make it even more simple let me describe it as delicious! Ok so the restaurant itself is a very popular hot spot and parking is tight in their lot. Cross your fingers you get a sport there as you may be in for a walk; inside is just as crowded with the wait staff having to fight through the standing room only bar to bring your food out (bad design in my opinion but allows you to see the delicious food before you order); my 2nd time there the bar was less crowded but was still packed.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their dishes and drinks and were helpful in making suggestions to compliment everything I ordered (I asked them to do this they weren't pushing specials) The food was top notch; even though they are small dishes they still have enough to share between two people.  My first trip had a party of 15 people and our total bill was around $170 (minus drinks) so everything is reasonably priced. On my 2nd trip my GF and I discovered they have a 2nd dining area in an adjacent store; not sure if that is why the bar wasn't crowded or if we just happened to miss a happy hour but there was virtually no difference between the two buildings and don't think you are being downgraded by being asked to walk next door to sit down;
4	I've been here several times and it's a great place with a large group. It's a tapas restaurant so order a variety from the menu and share. I haven't been here with a small group but assuming there's still a bit of a wait since the place is always packed. The times I've been here was with a group of 17-23 girls and both times our group was split up to 2-3  different tables so just expect that...which is fine if that means it'll be a shorter wait, about an hour w/out reservations. Make reservations!!Favorites: CEVICHE OF SHRIMP, TUNA TARTARE, FIREFLY FRIES, MUSHROOM TART, MANCHAEGO MAC 'N' CHEESE, FIRED CALAMARI, STEAMED CREAMY SAUCE MUSSELS, EMPANADA. I heard the FILET MIGNON SLIDERS and BABYBACK RIBS are good...trying that next time! It's a reasonable price here so worth the wait. While you're waiting for the food to come out...try their Sangria too!
5	Oh my god! If you like Spanish/Mexican than this is the place for you! Sangria, Tapas, Paella!
5	My parents and I dined at Firefly over labor day weekend. We called to make a reservation, but learned they do not take reservations on weekends. We decided we better arrive early so we wouldn't have to wait. We showed up right at 5 and were seated immediately, but by 6 the restaurant was full! The three of us split the following menu items: Artichoke Toasts, Stuffed Dates, Roasted Eggplant Cannoli, Pork Empanadas, Shrimp Tempura, Filet Mignon Sliders, Passion Fruit Cheesecake, Gelato, and Caramel Flan. We loved everything! Our favorite item was the Stuffed Dates, definitely give those a try! My parents enjoyed the Sangria and I had a delicious cappuccino (it's ok if it's after 10am in the states, right?). The service was wonderful and fast, and our waiter was very informative. The prices are very reasonable. I would return to this restaurant.
3	We were 50/50 with drinks and food. Some of them were done so poorly they went right back to the kitchen. Others were outstanding.A little quality control is in order here. Get to work Dave!PS Not at ALL the same vibe as on the strip. This was Chevy's Fresh Mex-ish and suitable for Hank to sit on the table.
5	This place is fantastic. I've been there at least a dozen times and have never had a bad thing to say.The food is delicious, the service is great, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, and the kitchen is fast. What more could you want?You can go in and order basically anything on the menu at random and it will all be good. Everything is fresh and well-seasoned and the food combinations are clever. Stuffed dates with bacon? Brilliant!The servers are attentive, they get your order right, and they seem to always be there when you need them. As an added bonus, they are cheerful and pleasant and make you feel welcome.The kitchen is also fast. Your food will start coming out soon after you order, so you are not sitting, miserably, waiting for food to come. The wait to be seated can get long on Friday and Saturday nights, but they are efficient and pretty good about getting you a seat as soon as they can.
5	One of my favorite spots in Vegas.  Whenever someone comes into town this is the first place I take them to eat! Try the steak and mushroom skewers, AMAZING!
5	Best food ever...Best staff, Best Atmosphere...Great if you are alone Great for a date....:))) Try anything you will not be disappointed!
5	We stopped at Firefly on our way out of town.  We always recommend getting off the strip and this is definitely a place to do it!  They must be doing something right b/c the place was packed by the time we left, and on a Tues afternoon, too.  It has a very charming decor.  It's very welcoming as soon as you walk in.  The dishes we had were the bacon wrapped dates (of course), shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare and the lamp chops.  Everything was very good but the lamb chops probably beat everything else out (followed by the dates).  My wife had a sangria she enjoyed.Service was attentive and helpful.  I thought the prices were very reasonable!Just a really nice special place if you want to get off the strip!
4	I honestly thought I had done a review for Firefly, but I guess I hadn't, so here goes.The food is very good, I can not think of a bad dish, we have our staples, the dates, the fries and then pretty much just shotgun the menu, order 4-5 other dishes depending on what our mood is.If there could be one complaint, for some reason they seem to like the lighting set low and the music high...Ok combination for a club, not so good when you are trying to do something silly like, oh read a menu and tell the wait staff what you would like....
5	I've had this restaurant on my Vegas Places to Eat List for a very long time! We're so happy to finally make it out on our last trip last month.It's dark, loud, intimately-cozy, lots of great food to share with our friends. Everything from the pitcher of the yummy white sangria to the bacon wrapped stuffed dates and lobster escargots were awesome!  It was a fun tapas style dinner before a long night ahead. Our waiter was spot on and terrific. We'll be back again.....Thank you! Cheers!TIP: Make a reservation! It gets packed for dinner. We used the Yelp Open Table link and got right in.
3	My first Firefly experience was A-OK. I went with a vegan friend and I was super excited to see that the menu is easily vegan friendly with a couple little tweaks.The bread they brought in the beginning was awesomely tasty. I was extremely grateful that they brought us that bread after I got my main plate.  I totally felt my inner fat kid come out when the waitress brought me my Tierra Y Mar Skewers (aka Skewers with shrimp, sausage, and filet minion.. yummmyyyy) and there were only 3 little skewers. My best advice for someone that is going for the first time? If you want to feel super full, order 2 or 3 main dishes or go to town on the bread and order a pitcher of the sangria. I would totally go back if one of my friends asked me to go with them. This is not a good restaurant if you are ready to pig out. This is a great restaurant if you like unique food that is made with a little TLC.
4	Excellent food for an excellent price. First trip and first Yelp, but highly impressed. Drinks are priced to recupe for the food, but definitely give it a shot.  If you see an open seat, you're lucky - take it. Four stars for great food but slightly overpriced drinks off of the strip.
5	This place was so much fun and the food was delicious...the restaurant was included in a bachelorette package I booked that included 2 hours of unlimited food and drinks. Great deal for 6 of us. Service was good too, the gentleman was actually from Spain. Started with pitchers of sangrias, mojitos, and margaritas. The sangria was the best and later we tried all the different flavors they offered, all were amazing. Our server sent out the house favorites, we ate so much I honestly couldnt tell you what we had but I know we loved 95% of it.  Always recommend to any guest staying Vegas.
5	Awesome! Be sure to go with a group so more plate can be ordered & tried. My group thoroughly enjoyed all our dishes, especially the bacon wrapped dates!
4	Great date place, great place to hang with friends.  A good chance to experience a variety of flavors without stuffing yourself silly.The food was excellent, across the board.  Good beer selection, but the wine selection was a bit limited, at least by the glass.We called for a reservation and they said they were booked solid, but if we came over, we could walk in and they would take us.  We arrived to find about 6-8 open tables, and were seated immediately.  Weird.Firefly is among the better, reasonably priced places I've tried in Vegas.
4	Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love their food and sangria SOO MUCH. I haven't really tried anything from their menu that I dislike and I love it! Favorite dishes: stuffed dates, tuna tartare, baked tetilla, manchego mac 'n' cheese, lobster escargot, camerones a la diabla, croquetas, the filet sliders... basically everything.  But I have to give this location one star off because it's near the strip so it's SUPER CROWDED and as a result the service can be a little slow. Also there are a number of sketchy characters in the parking lot (one guy came up to my car to ask me for money, another one yelled at my husband and called him a heathen??!).BUT they are open later than the other locations which is good for me and my late night tendencies! And it's Firefly so still super yummy.
4	This was my second time there.  It was pretty good.  I went with a big group of people.  It was pretty busy, so they escorted us to their other lounge location.  Most of the party ordered tapas.  Their fries and stuffed jalepenos were pretty good.  My friend got a pitcher of White Sangria which was really good.  I liked it a lot better than the one from Marbellas.  The White Sangria has pears, wine and brandy.  They marinate the sangria for a minimum of 3 days.  I'm not a fan of alcohol, but this one tasted pretty good.  It was a little bit bitter from the alcohol.  I'm still fairly new to drinking, so I can taste alcohol really easily.  My other friends said it was good. I tried sips of the paradise mojito and the blood orange mojito.  The paradise one was really really good.  I could taste coconut in it while the blood orange was tartier and too strong for my taste.  I want to go again and try more appetizers and different drinks.  :D
5	This is the second time I've been here while visiting Vegas and I would come back hands down.The food is amazing and unlike the rest of Vegas, NOT over priced. We had our fill of dinner and cocktails for less than $50 TIP INCLUDED! My wife (who can be very critical of dining experiences) loved it and wanted to come back the next night.
5	Funny to see the last person who reviewed Firefly is my brother! Hahaha. My hubby and I went to Firefly two nights in a row. It's a less than $10 cab ride from Renaissance Hotel on this last vacay in Vegas. We discovered Firefly back in 2005. ALWAYS enjoy their tapas, love the stuffed dates and red sangria!!! Been telling friends & family for years about this fun place! They now have misters to keep you cool on the outside patio & have opened up next door to accomadate more patrons. Incidentally, the previous review was made the weekend before we came for Mr Olympia. We both live in California.
5	As a local, this was one of my favorite places to go with friends or to take visitors. There is something for everyone on the menu. Everything from fries to bacon wrapped dates to skewers to empanadas to escargot. The cocktails are refreshing - a variety of different types of sangria and mojitos and so on. And the atmosphere is great. Fun place to go on a hot Vegas night. Makes me miss living there just thinking about it.
5	What a great little restaurant.  It was so worth going off strip to eat here.  Our group of 8 visited last Saturday night and the wait was only about 25 minutes at 9 at night.  The menu is pretty extensive and the drinks did not disappoint.  The favorite drinks at the table were the infused vodka, which hubby enjoyed 3 of, raspberry mojito, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and the sangria, which was a crowd pleaser.Highlights: bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartare, petite filet, empanada, ceviche, spicy shrimp, lemon tarts and chocolate tres leches cakeLowlights: lobster escargot (too mushy), sorbet (flavors were not very good)We also tried the chorizo stuffed clams, ribs, potatoes, tilapia filets and a few other things that I can't remember.  These were just OK and not that memorable.Service wasn't very attentive ... it took longer than it should have to clear plates and bring drinks, but that was pretty minor compared to the food.This place is great for groups and the prices are amazing compared to the other places we ate in Vegas.  Total bill was approximately $300, which is pretty damn good.  Definitely a must try place if you want to get off the Strip.
5	Nicely nestled in a small plaza off the Vegas strip is a place that, if not for sites like Yelp, might be regretfully overlooked by Las Vegas visitors. However, it is no secret to residents like me!Although you will find this gem tightly packed even on any given weekday, it is more than worth it to squeeze your way in to the warmly decorated ambiance that is this little Vegas treasure. Try to get there with time to spare so you can sit outside and admire the lights and energy that make this city great. Not only are you welcomed immediately by the intoxicating smells of the kitchen, but as soon as you get the menu you are reassured that you have come to the right place! Extensive options include the must-try-at-least-once or twice the bacon-wrapped dates, the avocado gazpacho, roasted beet salad w/sherry vinaigrette, mushroom tart (gotta love mushies for this one), and last but not least, the veggie empanada! Do not leave this place without trying the empanada, meat or veggie, either will delight your taste-buds. Fast service, pleasant smiles on the servers faces even with a full house of hungry patrons, delicious veggie, meat and seafood options, and an affordable staple (at around $4-$9 a dish) to put on your list for any day of the week. There is no doubt that this is the place to take friends when they come and visit! Enjoy!
4	This place is always our first stop whenever we fly into Sin City. The menu is extensive. The servers are on the ball. You can't go wrong ordering the sangria, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, the mushroom tart and the Firefries!
5	One of those spots that have been there forever and you still don't get tired of it. Pretty much having the same same menu for years but that's what makes it awesome. Why fix what is not broken right? that principle works like a charm with this fellasMost plates are tapas style which means they are small, however its a good thing that they are because you can start exploring the menu. The paella however, is big enough to share.Try the pulpo asado if you feel a little risky and willing to experience its amazing flavor. Tetilla cheese for the cheese lovers or camaron a la diabla for those who like  it hot.A must try is their filet Mignon sliders with cheese and the garlic fries Don't kiss a vampire after them fries though. Actually don't kiss anything .and not because your newly uber stinky breath ..but because you don't want to share all that awesome garlic flavor left inside your mouthWaiting time can get crazy. specially on the weekends this place tends to get packed and loud..not because of the music but the people around you. The decor is great and the music is very good and goes perfect with the ambiance. Red is a predominant color so if you are a bull please dont be hitting the walls.Before leaving try their well known signature drinks. Their mojitos are delicious!! And the sangria is refreshing and super tasty. A whole pitcher of the sangria and 3 mojitos might make you stand up on a table..get a red napkin and cry to the Madrid and Barcelona gods as loud as you can : "OLE OLE!!!..Yes it was fun..dont judge me..well at least until security came in...Viva espana y hasta manana!!
4	amazing food,  this location it is always pretty packed so plan accordingly. Great atmosphere, the food is extra tasty, service sometimes can get slow but that it.  Great music, they restaurant is dimly lit so it great for both date nights and social gathering.i would recommend................the empanadasthe pulpo asadothe bacon wrapped datesand buy a pitcher of sangria its so worth
5	Thank you fellow Yelpers, you did good!Loved everything about this place. Great food, excellent prices and a happening ambiance. Five of us ate so many tapas, some favorites were the Mac n Cheese (2 orders) Filet, Mushroom Tart, Tuna Tartar, Sausages, Tortilla (egg, potato, onion) 5 different desserts and drinks for a really great price. SHOCKING, especially since my husband kept trying to talk me into another high end tapas restaurant. I will definitely be back. I recommended this place to a friend the next night (both of us were in town for a trade show) and he loved it as well.
5	I'm so glad we got off of the strip for dinner! Though I saw all the stellar reviews by those I know and trust, I was still a little skeptical (or perhaps it was residual grumpiness from not being able to get a table at Mesa Grill..).Our party of 5 snagged a table easily at about 7:30 on a Saturday night. I think it was sheer luck and great timing because thereafter I could see groups waiting outside and as we were leaving lines of people (lots of feathers, wigs, bunny ears, sequins - you name it! Vegas is so crazy) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#pcF2Ql6hcUzQ3Oey_mX-zAI love LOVE LOVE LOVE tapas bars!  Firefly truly embodied the style I became accustomed to in other major cities, extensive menu, contemporary twist on latin-inspired cuisine, priced to order multiple and share and tasty cocktails. The ambiance was cozy, loud and exciting - the smells of delicious food, glasses and plates clinking and excited chatter was a nice background to the awesome dinner we enjoyed.  Remembering our dinner almost a month ago, I've got to echo the hundreds of other reviewers in saying GET THE BACON-WRAPPED DATES!!!!  We did and loved them so much we ordered them twice!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#iv_9yqEHI5K5FFmBR2FYZAI'd also highly recommend you save a tiny bit of room in your tummy for the dessert platter!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#AatAVzAxwN6YmxCozEAMcQThe house-made infused vodka drink was also really good, It could have been a tad stronger so I recommend ordering a extra shot of vodka on the side to amp it up :)
3	Cool, hip place off the strip. Read all the great yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot while visiting my parents. They are pretty straightforward eaters so they were pretty critical. I thought some of the dishes were very good and some were not executed too well. The best was the tuna tartare and the signature dates wrapped in bacon.The beet salad hardly had any beets. Mainly lettuce. The empanadas were mostly pastry, and the fillings (had a vegetable and meat) needed more seasoning.  The filet sliders could have better better if the steak was not cooked wekk done. Meat was tender, just way overcooked.We had 4-5 other plates. Just nothing to make to come back when I am in town with all the other great dining choices.On a plus note, prices were very reasonable and service was quick and friendly. Just don't get all the raves about the food.
4	With over a thousand reviews and a 4.5 rating, Firefly was on my list of places to try in Vegas! We had a party of five and we were pretty hungry! I love tapas because it gives us the opportunity to try multiple dishes and share rather than chowing down one large plate of burger and fries. I love trying different dishes!The dishes we had were good. Some dishes were better than others. Here's what we ordered (between $4-$9 a plate):- Apple and manchego salad. So fresh and so good! This plate was rather larger than the others. The apples were super crunchy and sweet!- Roasted baby beet salad. YUM!- Stuffed dates. Super yummy! Love the crumbled blue cheese.- Veggie empanada. This was just ok. Too doughy for me and not enough veggies and cheese!- Firefly fries. It was good but I thought it could use more herbs and aioli.- Manchego mac and cheese. Yum! Thank goodness we shared otherwise I would have felt super guilty eating the whole plate!- Baked tilapia. Thumbs up!- Ahi tuna skewer. Super fresh and flavorful.- Ham and cheese croquets. Super good! - Camarones a la diabla. The BEST! The diabla sauce was well made. I used my break and fries to soak up the sauce. It was THAT good!Let's not forget the bread, olives and butter they bring out to you when you are seated. So good! The butter is some herb/spicy butter. I've never loved butter before until now, lol.Everyone raved about the Sangria. It was nothing special to be honest. I've had better sangria elsewhere but I'm glad we tried it.The restaurant is super close to Harrahs. We could have walked here but it was raining and way dark out since we came late. It's really dark inside but most tapas are. We didn't even have to wait, walked in and they immediately sat us. The staff were all super friendly and nice. Service was quick, thank goodness since I was starving!I will definitely come back to Firefly and try the other items. I won't be ordering the sangria though!
4	Such a gem off the strip; this place is awesome! We started off with some ceviche and then we each ordered the lobster escargots which was the best part of the meal! The mussels in coconut sauce was a pleasant surprise. We also shared the huge serving of paella. Although I've definitely had better, it was great for the price. Overall great experience-- we will definitely be back!
5	WooHoo! This place is a must when in LV!!  Food is awesome and affordable for LV. Great place to have a few drinks and enjoy some Great food with friends, Everytime we've gone to Vegas.... Firefly is definitely on the list of places to go. Love this place
5	Amazing!!!!  Artichoke toasts are one of my favorites..stuffed dates,mushroom tarte..so good!!  We were so stuffed but had too get the nutella and banana dessert..it was great!!  I was so shocked it was so cheap..everything was about  $35 for two of us!It is loud but I don't mind it and there is usually a wait but you can make reservations. A great place!!!
5	Great place to have a good small portioned meal with a Lady.   Its fancy but casual.  Very inviting.  :)
5	I came here wanting to try a really good tapas restaurant and ever since , trying to find one to compare has been difficult back home. Their Manchego Mac n' Cheese is a must because something about that cheese gives it that extra "mmph" in your mouth. You should definitely try their patatas bravas as well, they are different from your regular french fries because they are cut into cubes or thicker pieces and then cooked until the potatoes are crispy on the edges and soft on the insides, spiced with good seasoning and drizzled in creamy aioli. Service was great as well. I'm just hoping my visit to Vegas will be very soon so that I could update my review for this place.
1	This place opened about 6 months ago and it was WONDERFUL.....it went down hill soooo fast....it is BAD.  Even the recipes have changed...portions smaller too...the place is DIRTY and smells bad.  Our wait staff has always been nice except the bartender who is non describably un bartender-ish and makes us feel that we are unwelcome.  They have 3 locations...this one is on Eastern Ave.
5	I went to a tapas place once before but nothing can compare to the Firefly restaurant. Some friends brought us here because they've been going to this place literally forever. I can see why they love this place so much. We went Friday night and it was really busy. Even with reservations we had to wait a good half hour to forty minutes. But the wait was completely worth it once they serve you the food. We ordered Bacon-wrapped dates (delish), lobster escargot (OMG), Macaroni and Cheese (better than what mom can make), and sooooo much more. The food was unbelievable and so good. Some friends had sangrias and we all had a really good time.Service was fantastic as well, as our waiter kept check up on us and offering refills on my soda. The only (and I mean only) disadvantage with this place is if you come by taxi in a large group. It's easy to get there but it is much more difficult with 5 or more people trying to get back by taxi. My friends and I spent a half hour afterwards trying to hail taxis of Paradise Boulevard to no avail. Eventually, a private driver picked us up for double the price because we had no other options.But if that's not a big deal, then definitely this place is soooo much better than anything you can find on the strip.
5	Skyler the bartender was outstanding. Should be nominated bartender of the year!!!! Great drinks and service.
4	I've come here a few times, and each time, the service is great.  Presuming you have done tapas before, you order a small amount, and you continue ordering small amounts until everyone is tapped...so the wait staff is usually hovering around, checking on you and asking if you want/need anything.Atmosphere is cool...very trendy/date night appropriate, but still very casual.On to the food...I have tried a little bit of everything here.  Dishes go from relatively inexpensive to about $10...but a lot of the good ones are $10 and you will have to order a few, so it does add up fast.Can't go wrong with the fries...large basket, big enough to share and sit on the table to snack on between plates.  We also like the chorizo clams and lobster here....lots of flavor.  The ceviche is also top notch, one of the best I have had, and the tuna tartare is very good.I really like the stuffed dates...these are an interesting taste, so you might not, but I would still recommend trying them.  Mac and cheese is also very good, as is the fish and chips, calamari and crab corn dogs.  We also like the sliders and skewers.Best part about the experience, is trying a bunch of everything.  If you come here expecting to get full off 2-3 dishes, it is not going to happen.  You will have to try a bunch of little things, but it is almost like a small tasting menu, that you get control!Have fun
4	food is 3.5 stars. special drinks are so-so,,, not so special. however the price is very reasonable - so, i give 4 stars. atmosphere,,, really loud - music and these people talking too loud. what is the matter with these restaurants with dim lighting??? do they think it is sexy or something? wrong! for these reasons, i like to visit here for lunch when it is not too loud, not too dark,,, having lunch with wine at the patio right now (October) is just perfect!
4	Sitting in a fairly unassuming and cookie-cutter shopping center east of the Strip is this gem of a tapas restaurant. I hate the fact that every place uses the term "tapas" to mean small dishes when they aren't serving spanish food. Okay, so I'm being somewhat picky about the terminology, but it bugs me when I see a japanese izakaya that advertises itself as japanese tapas; an izakaya implies small dishes and pub food! Will dimsum be thrown to the curb to ape a more trendy term as well?! Okay, okay, that was probably out of line. Let's move on, shall we?Showed up with a group of six for a late sunday night dinner. No problem, we get seated right away a few feet from romancing couples and a table of near naked people celebrating halloween.  Off to a good start as far as I'm concerned.Here's the low down on what we got:Ceviche - tasty, there were larger and smaller pieces of shrimp and the bright citrus flavor was better than the salty watered down salsa versions I've had elsewhere.Stuffed Dates - wow, so good. The dates aren't that sweet and you mostly get the smokey bacon flavor with a hint of sweetness and a crunch almond surprise on the inside. The blue cheese goes really nice with it.Patatas Bravas - probably my least favorite out of everything we got that night. Tastes like big chunks of red potato. Meh.Thai Beef Salad - I'm not really sure what that thai beef was, but it seemed like a pancake made of protein with things mixed in. Tasted okay, but I wasn't in a salad mood which might explain why I didn't love this one either.Fried Calamari - Pretty straight up dish with nothing either outstanding about it nor bad. If you like fried calamari elsewhere, you'll probably like it here.  I'd probably save my stomach for something you can't find at every Italian restaurant on earth.Beef Empanada - These were really good if you like a flaky pastry with meat filling. The only bad thing was that there's two pieces to an order.Paella - Wow, by far my favorite! Order 2 per person so you'll never have to share. The chorizo was really good and I kept ignoring the seafood to snag some. I want a plate of this in front of me right now and I wouldn't hesitate to shoot a deer in the face to have it.What I'd want to try next time:Chicken and Chorizo Stuff MushroomsCrabclaw Corn DogsTuna TartareSausage PlateGreat place. Really dark inside (a table near us used their phones to read the menu) with an overabundance of those crappy paintings of spanish dancers shown from behind wearing a red dress that you see being sold on every cruise art auction.  Stop buying those paintings, people! They're pumped out of a kinko's printer in Cincinnati onto canvas!TL;DR: Don't buy crappy art; eat at Firefly now.
4	This is another staple spot for me in Las Vegas. As I am usually here on business, my company has me stay close to the convention center. Not that I wouldn't make the journey across town to Firefly in any other case, but it is convenient that it is right down Paradise. Here's what's up:Food: This is a tapas bar. We usually just order like crazy and sample sample sample everything that ends up on the table. Here's the thing: you could throw 10 darts at the menu, order whatever you hit, and you'll be happy. Don't get me wrong there are some things that are better than others but seriously everything is legit. My biggest suggestion are the sliders. Beverages: Like most places in Vegas, there's no good beer. It's a harsh reality that I have come to except. They have some in between beers and a few good cocktails, but certainly do not come here for the flow of quality liquid.Environment: It makes sense that Firefly has a very Spanish feel to it. It's a tapas bar after all. I'm a fan of how communal the layout is. In the tradition of everyone sharing food, Firefly has a very intimate feel where you are not necessarily 'packed in', but the feeling of being close to everyone promotes the idea of being 'one' and encouraging the idea of sharing. Sort of like most Ethiopian restaurants- where you're all eating from the same plate and the conversations occur in a very raw, intimate setting.Certainly an 'off strip' gem that is worth checking out. Be prepared to eat lots!Salud!
4	We came here for hubby's Las Vegas birthday bash.  We'd been wanting to come here for a few years now but just never made it.  Boy, we were glad we came!!This place was bumpin'....we showed up and the restaurant was already full.  We were promptly seated and quickly served. We were a big party so we all ordered what we wanted which meant a lot of food on the table.  At first, they were slow in clearing the plates but eventually this little lady came by and basically patrolled our table, picking up empty plates as soon as the last bite came off of it.  That lady was on top of it, filling waters, clearing plates, getting everything we wanted.  At one point, we saw someone from a departing party hand her a tip on their way out.  Doesn't surprise me!  She was awesome! (We tipped her separately too)Food time!!I have to admit, there were some hits and some misses.  But the hits very much out shadowed the misses.  Misses: Tomato Bread - I was hoping for the simple version we had all over Barcelona but it turned out to be over-vinegary and the bread wasn't nearly substantial enough to sustain the topping so it became soggy very fast.Lobster Escargot - This dish was overcooked so that the lobster was mushy and not fresh tasting at all.  The seasoning was not enough to make the sauce bread-dipping worthyHIts:Pulpo Asado - Roasted octopus...nice portion and the octopus was perfectly cooked and tender to the bitePaella - I haven't had a good history with paella but I daresay this was my favorite version so far.  The rice was well cooked and the ingredients were perfectly balanced with each other.Ribeye - This was topped with a blue cheese butter, one of my favorite treatments of steak.  I asked for it medium rare and it was served to me that way, perfect!!Mushroom Tart - Mushroom gravy-ish thing topping a square of puff pastry. Not exactly a "tart" but delicious nonetheless.All in all, it was a great time.  We had the sparkling sangria to drink.  Don't expect high octane stuff but it was a great palate refresher.
4	A very good low key Tapas place in Vegas. The good thing is that its not on the strip, which makes parking easy and its not that crowded if you go early. They have a very good variety of tapas. We had the ceviche - which was almost perfect, the only complaint was it was an only shrimp ceviche. I usually prefer the whole sea in the ceviche!! The Gazpacho was average. The octopus was very well done, but the star of the meal were the different skewers we ordered. The surf and turn one - with filet, shrimp and chorizo which was excellent. and the Ahi tuna one was even better. The tuna was perfectly grilled and the mix of mango and pineapple with it just hit the spot. There are two seating areas and there is also some seating outside which was full. The main area was a little loud especially because of the loud music playing inside. The side section which had the bar was quieter, we just sat at the bar which was probably the ideal thing to do.Oh almost forgot to mention the Sangria's, we tried the red and sparkling and both were well made. Maybe a little on the fruity side which is why we balanced it with some Vodka shots :)
5	Love it! Come every time I'm in Vegas!
4	Great fun, & great food. Usually crowded so get there early. Our group tried 4 different entries, and they were all good.
5	Wow.  Blown away.  After spending $150-$200 for dinner for two on the strip we went to this place.  On a Monday night, it was quite crowded.  My wife and I each had 3 plates, she had a high end martini, me a Pyrat rum drink and a Grand Marnier for dessert... and the bill was $74!!  AMAZING food, the Tuna Tartar and stuffed mushrooms in particular.  Only 2 blocks off the strip, this place is a GEM.  I am not easily impressed and dine out a LOT, but this place blew me away.  No complaints with noise, seating or service either......
5	best food ever in Vegas. You can waste 150USD in a average steakhouse or come 3 times here for delicious food.
5	I have never been to a TapasGrill, but WOW!!!!  I'm a fan now!!!
2	I was in Vegas for a conference and handsome and I enjoy trying new places that they don't have in LA. We pulled up Yelp and noted all the great reviews for this place and decided to try it out.Here's what I thought: - Service was good - garlic bread was tough  - almond butter was ok - Bacon wrapped dates not bad, but not great - shrimp with garlic was ok - ceviche was fare - chicken, chorizo and cheese stuffed mushrooms was good until it got cold - sardines were average - prosciutto and cheese plate was meh - wine list was weak and had no dates - the lobster "escargot" was TERRIBLE! Glad the server took it off our bill.As you can see, we did not particularly enjoy our experience at Firefly. Sorry guys...
4	Yummy food and tasty Sangria!!
5	Go here! The food is just perfect! They made me love fish and I don't even like fish! After being surrounded with neon and that Steve Wynn advert that plays when you get into any cab in Vegas, I was feeling like a moment of fresh air off the strip. Firefly is tucked away just far enough where you can catch a cheap cab, or even walk if you're feeling particularly adventurous (or if you indulge in a pitcher of their sparkling sangria like we did). The place is incredibly romantic. Everything has a warm red glow, tables are cozy, and although it's a popular spot, we were able to get in at prime time with only a twenty minute wait. I was totally full after splitting 5 tapas in total - the patatas bravas are heavenly and spicy (ask for them spicy - it's not overwhelming, but it adds so much flavor). Prices are fairly normal, but after eating on the strip a few days, you'll feel like some kind of coupon queen (or king). Seriously a great find - perfect food, just the right atmosphere, and sangria to write home about.
5	this place is great!!! i love the food it has alot of flavor to it , the waitress are nice the whole experience was very nice i will definitely come back when im in VEGAS!
5	If I learned I was going to die tomorrow, I would eat my last meal at Firefly.Food and drinks are amazing!I always have to get the Manchengo Mac N Cheese and Chicken Skewers with either a Flavored Mojito or Sangria!Love the food. Love the atmosphere. if you've never stopped to eat here make sure you put it on your To Do list!
5	Amazing Sangria. Try the bacon wrapped dates. They are the best.
4	The food and drinks here at the Paradise location is terrific!! Every time we go to Vegas, Firefly is part of our agenda. IMO - Tapas or small dishes is the best way to eat and share food. I have seen tasting menus at other restaurants that are twice the price with less variety. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they changed the Firefly Fries from shoe-string potatoes to regular french fries. The taste and texture is totally different. and not worthy of 5 stars. Hopefully they will change the fries back.
5	This is by far one of the best Tapas place we have ever been to!  This place stomps all of the fancy and expensive tapas restaurant.  Firefly  is bustling!  Located about 10 min away from the Strip of Las Vegas, is a gem.  When we arrived, this place was PACKED!  We were very impressed with the service, considering the amount of people they were serving, they were cranking out small dishes very very efficiently.  We noticed a small kitchen with only a few workers, but their efficiency was equivalent to about 10 cooks.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy, dark, yet very inviting.  We were very happy with the prices, everything we ordered was $10 or less, but you are definitely getting loads of flavor and ingredients that is worth more than $10.We started out with what we thought was the best dish of the night...Anchovy Toast!  The anchovies were delicious...very good quality.  Slightly salty and perfectly paired with creamy avocado, fresh parsley, chewy baguette, and drizzled with a mildly spicy olive oil.Skewers of spicy chorizo, shrimp, and tender steak.  These skewers were delicious!  All the components were cooked well and nothing was overdone.  This is actually pretty difficult when you have things on a skewer that cooks at different rate.  Kudos to Firefly for doing it right!Grilled octopus with potatoes were quite tasty.  The octopus was so tender and seasoned well but it didn't cover the sweetness that came from the octopus. This was actually surprisingly good!  A chorizo fondue ..wow YUMMY!  This came out pipping hot...the flavor was spicy yet creamy and gooey at the same time.  This was pretty addictive. The lamb chops were excellent!  Probably one of the best dish of the night and so affordable.  For $10, we got 2 thick cuts of lamb chops, it cost that much usually just to buy the ingredient if not more.  The lamb had a very good lamb flavor, cooked to medium rare, tender, and very juicy!  We wish we had room to eat another plate =)This last dish was the lobster escargot.  So this dish is basically a new creation of garlic butter escargot, but instead of the meats being escargot, they made this with lobster nuggets.  This was just as you would imagine...buttery, tantalizing garlic flavor, and savory goodness of the lobster meat.  How can you possibly go wrong?Overall this was a great FIND!  This is one of the places we would hands down come back for a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th meal.  Firefly has a big menu so you could probably order different dishes every time   This place had speedy and efficient service.  I would say it's not as comfortable to sit in just because this place is always packed and there is not very much elbow room.  The food is amazing and much better than any of the highly priced Tapas places we have eaten before.  We would rate this place a 9 for service, flavor, creative dishes, and affordability.
5	Such a lovely little restaurant with a patio, the food is great and fair price. If I go to Vegas I will defiantly go have lunch here if you like tapas.
5	Immediate outdoor seating with heat lamps, casual atmosphere, friendly prompt service (with rapid water refills), ample parking, dim suburban lounge atmosphere. Would not have found this place without Yelp! The icing on the cake was the affordable small-plates with a Spanish "influence" (although, that may be a bit far fetched):Patatas Bravas: huge plate of roasted potatoes with aioli sauce. Very filling.Stuffed dates with bacon, easily the best tapas we had. Four dates total.Lentils with vegetables: Just OK; prepped very "clean" without much oil.Warm spinach salad: again, just OK; tastes exactly how it sounds.Tomato soup with brie sandwich: not bad, the sandwich was rather plain but the soup was just right for a cool November evening. Sangria: surprisingly good; sparkling white wine with blueberries and mangoes. Starter: crusty baguette with garlic and honey butter. The honey butter really complimented; the baguette was just OK.Total bill, $48 + tip.If you care to venture off the strip, this place is definitely worth checking out.
3	Firefly is a great place, but I've had a couple of not so great experiences with their seafood, which is a shame cause I love ze fishies.
5	Delish!  This was a really fun place. We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates and they were wonderful, even though we were really unsure about them. We also order the empanadas, which I thought were pretty good, but my wife thought were excellent. Finally, the filet mignon was absolutely delicious. I loved it. We will be back again (if we ever go to Vegas again; not a big fan if Vegas).
3	Great service and alright food.
3	This place is HYPE.  Sorry to all my fellow yelpers who gave them solid 4's and 5 but the dishes sound A WHOLE LOT better on paper than executed!  So we were on our way to Capriottis and I told PIC to make a U-turn and please lets go to Firefly LOL.  So we came in before the lunch rush. Place is cute nothing toooo special. Service was good. Scaled the menu and again I want it all LOL! So we order a few things. The goat cheese stuffed peppers. They were ok but not even close to Jaleos version of it. The empanadas were for the PIC, they were good but I wasn't focused on that. The albondias wasn't a soup but a plate of meatballs in some red sauce. The came out lukewarm not even hot. I hate that shit because I rarely get borderline cold food! But that ruined my favorite latin dish! The mushroom puff pastry dish was HUGE, way to big. I wish they detailed that on the menu! It was AOK Just to large and didn't go with the theme of the eatery to me! The favorite dish of the lunch was the shrimp tempura. The veggies that were also tempura were BOMB. The carrots so damn good. I could eat a whole plate of those carrots!  I might comeback here if I was with a bunch of gfs in Vegas wanting something off the grid a bit!  But yea this is hype to me. SOWEE
2	Something going on with Yelp review situation and this restaurant.  We got snowed by it.  Don't let it happen to you.  Normally this rating at 1100+ reviews says astonishing awesome.  This place is just...fine.We went with 7 ppl and ordered a bunch of tapas.  The menu and descriptions are amazing.  First, food was delivered entirely in a span of 5 minutes.  It was like a race from the kitchen.  It was overwhelming, and we felt like it was a race to eat, b/c salads came with hot tapas...all tapas were served on dinner plates so there was very little room to even accommodate the food.  Zero sensitivity from staff in making this work.  Felt like fast food service. Yuck.Second, food is average...at best.  Spicy beef salad is one of my favorite dishes.  Beef was overcooked and leathery and the salad had iceberg lettuce with zero flavor, no spice...bizarre actually.  Fries should have been great but were mushy and underdone.  Apple and manchego salad -- a real winner from Jaleo in DC fame--was just that...no zing from garlic or anything acidic to add punch.  There were some winners.  Stuffed eggplant and meatballs were good.  Sauce for beef skewers was good.  So, go here if you want a decent dinner.  Do not go here thinking you're getting a great dinner.  Food quality is average at best  Preparation completely uneven.  Service is like a high school cafeteria.This will be my last visit.  I was at the LV Strip adjacent location.
3	We saw this place for the first time in 12/11 but could not get in because it was packed with a wait time of almost 2 hours. Then we saw it on TV on a food channel, maybe Restaurant Stakeout, where it was profiled for horrible service. During this trip to Vegas we stopped by in late afternoon and were seated immediately, although we were warned that the computers were down so the service may be slow.The experience was mixed. The wife loved her beet salad, and I got smoked salmon on toasts that was very good. We also split a vegie empanada that was good, although the wife liked it better than I. Our "main" courses consisted of lamb skewers for the wife and serrano sliders for me. Her lamb was tough and chewy. The toughest lamb she ever had at any restaurant in her life. She actually just spit it out in a napkin. My sliders were not very good. There was no serrano ham. I asked the waitress if they forgot to add the ham and she said it was in the beef patty. That was a lie, because the patty was pure beef, unless the ham was microscopic and flavorless. Another problem is that the sliders were dry and overcooked. And I mean way overcooked, as in hockey pucks. Overall, the flavors did not come together with the aioli and it just did not taste good. I could barely finish the two sliders, and frankly, I did not want to. On the  positive side, the food came out in a timely manner, despite problems with the computer. The service was substandard. Our waitress Fernanda disappeared after taking our order. I had to ask random waiters for another drink and for the bill. Mind you, this was 4:30pm and the place was not busy. Where she was or what she was doing, I have no idea. Groups of waiters/waitresses were congregating and talking, hugging, laughing, etc. Apparently, the Restaurant Stakeout effect has worn off. On the positive side, we arrived during happy hour so drinks were half price. I wanted to try the filet mignon sliders but they were not on the menu.My wife wants to give this place a 4, my experience was a 2, so I am compromising on a 3, as in average, not "A-ok". I would never return and would never choose to spend my money at this place again.
5	Delicious tapas and great for a quick, relatively inexpensive lunch. My wife and I shared four tapas:Manchego mac & cheeseBacon wrapped satesChorizo stuff mushroomsTuna tartareAll were delicious and it was about $35 with tip. That's great, in my opinion, for food of this caliber in Las Vegas. The service was fast and always attentive with the refills. My brother says the sparking sangria is awesome, but we didn't try it.This is located in the strip mall right across the street from Del Friscos Double Eagle Steakhouse.
4	mexican people are work hard and they were very attentive nice. good quik food and tasty
5	So glad that I gave this joint a go. The food was off the sheezy, awesome and filling paella that would give the ones in Spain a run for its money. Noteworthy dishes included: mac n' cheese, empanadas,  dates wrapped in bacon, and lamb chops. Everything came out fast and the sangria was also delicious, a pitcher to share is a must if dining as a group. This place was a huge hit for our party of 15.
5	Simply put this place is AMAZING!  Probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had in my life.  The food here is on a whole other level & the attention to detail is superb. These folks are turning out world class tapas dishes that taste & appear like something you would see on a "Food & Wine" cover.  I went with a few friends and we shared a ton of different dishes & 2 pitchers of Sangria for a total bill of less than $100.00. My only advice would be to get there early, on a Monday night the wait was easily over an hour & on weekends I'm told the waits exceed 2+ hours quickly.
2	I DON'T GET IT!!Everyone at my table of 6 found this place absolutely disappointing and unspectacular. 3 of us ordered the following dishes to share:1. Smoked salmon toast- Thinly sliced smoked salmon with dill sour cream and capers. It was a'ight. The taste was nothing noteworthy.2. Tuna tartare- Raw, cubed tuna with avocado in sesame oil. This was perhaps my favorite dish, with a great savory flavor.3. Stuffed dates- Bacon-wrapped date stuffed with an almond and goat cheese. I commend them for the flavor matching of the sweet fig and the savory bacon. I can appreciate the different textures- soft fig with crunchy almond and creamy goat cheese. The favors were perhaps too bold for me that I could only eat one.4. Roasted eggplant cannelloni- The eggplant was mushy, with a thick layer of mushy goat cheese. The textures did not bode well with me. The tastes were unremarkable.5. Pulpo asado- Grilled octopus with potatoes. This is actually the best octopus I've tasted, simply because it was not chewy like other dishes I've had before. 6. Petit filet-  This was a'ight. I think I meant to get the sliders, but instead ordered the filet. I've definitely had better steaks.7. Merguez- Lamb sausage was dry and not particularly tasty.8. Sparkling sangria- Delicious and bubbly sangria.Total price ~$30/ personI do admit that my expectations were high upon entering. However, I do believe I've tasted much better tapas before. Firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table.
5	This place is awesome! The food was spectacular and the service was above average. Our food started coming within a few minutes. I have been wanting to try a Tapas place but there are none where I live. So if you're in Vegas this place is a must go....I tried 6 different things and all were great. Our waiter was Danny and he was very helpful and knew the menu thoroughly.
5	WOA!! Super close to strip. AMAZING food. Good prices. Locals like.
4	Ambiance was hip.  Definitely good for the younger crowd.  But the food was also really good!  Loved the ceviche, chorizo clam, and stuffed dates was also pretty interesting.  I would've given 5 stars, but a couple of the steamed mussels were slightly off.  Price was reasonable, too!
4	I think the one on the westside is much better. We went for lunch on a Sunday to the Paradise location and it wasn't too busy. We had somewhat slow service but the stuffed dates and apple and manchego salad didn't disappoint.  Some to the fried plates were a bit cold and the last item we ordered took way too much time to come out. When it did, it was so hot as to approach a meltdown and so we waited nearly 15 minutes for it to be safe to eat.I still like this place and it is the best Tapas restaurant in town.
5	Every time we come to Las Vegas, my family and I try a different local restaurant. We finally got around to trying this place, and boy was I impressed.First, I noticed a chic atmosphere with lots of fun lighting and good music, including some fantastic hits from the 80s to Mexican polka gone pop. The hostess and servers were very friendly and accomodating.I had a pitcher of sangria to myself (wife just hit her third trimester, so I'm drinking for two) and it was incredibly delicious. Less ice, more wine is my only complaint. But still plenty to drink, and considering it was happy hour, it was only $14 and the pitcher was ginormous.We had the ham and cheese croquettes, veggie empanadas, ceviche, spanish tortilla and firefly fries. Every dish was wonderfully rich and tasted amazing. These fries? Just as good as the truffle fries at Bacchi Burger, and everything that Red Robin WISHES it could serve.The total was $48 and that included five different tapas and a pitcher of incredible sangria (which soaks for a minimum of three days). Not bad at all considering the amazing experience I had here. Hell, even the free bread was wonderful. And if you sit at the bar during happy hour? Free appetizers!Bottom line: Don't miss your chance. Eat here. I promise you will not regret it.
3	Let me first begin with 5 stars on service! The most friendly staff ever! Very professional, doting, and incredibly familiar with the menu. But the food was seriously lacking compared to what I was prepared for. We had the ceviche, tune tartare, stuffed dates, octopus, spicy shrimp, and beet salad. Everything was good, but nothing was great or memorable. The words that come to mind are flat and boring. Mind you the ambiance is not included in this discription. The ambiance is very lively and drinking in moderation is not recommended. In a world filled with tapas restaurants this is not the top of my list.
2	Food was so-so. Not sure what the big deal is with Tapas.
5	Tapas!!! One of my favorite things in the world. I love variety. I'm not the person to order a pasta plate with one sauce and one type of noodle with some toasted bread in the side. I love different things in 1 meal. With firefly you can have multiple things in 1 meal therefor satisfying all your hearts wants and desires. Beet salad-amazingCeviche- spectacularSpinach salad- divineWe probably had about 8 other plates of different stuff that made my tummy happy! They are kinda famous for their different flavored mojitos. I tried my husbands watermelon one, it was good. I tried my father in laws blueberry one, it was good, but I got just a plain lime and mint mojito that was by far the best. Stick to the original. Tapas places are not for everyone but they make my knees weak and I will totally go back here the next time I'm in Vegas!
5	Packed on a Monday evening!! I think we waited about a half hour.  Sangria!!! Firefly is a tapas bar located off the strip but absolutely worth the drive or taxi ride for those who enjoy awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. Sometimes it's nice to get off the strip away from all the gambling and tourists.Food and service were also great!-Ceviche - very tasty.-Thai Beef Salad - this might have been my favorite dish.-Empanada - good!-Bacon Wrapped Dates - a must.The three of us shared a pitcher of Sangria It's as good as the Sangria I make at home...which is really good!! We had a great time!
5	My favorite restaurant to go to when in Vegas!!  I've been to Vegas more times than I can count, and this is my favorite spot around the strip. I know Vegas has some amazing restaurants, and I've been to quite a few nice dinners within all the giant hotels. I am not going to sit here and say that Firefly has better food than every other restaurant. However, when you combine the chic atmosphere, great taste, friendly service, flavorful drinks (sangria, mojitos, martinis) and amazing price this place is by far the best.I've recommended this place and taken many friends here and everyone has loved it. And most return and take their friends when they visit Vegas again.    Unfortunately, and the only negative is the wait. On Friday and Saturdays they don't take reservations for groups less than 10.  So if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes or more (which I don't if I know it is worth it) then definitely hit up this spot.  You won't regret it.It's nice being able to step a few miles away from the craziness of the strip and find this gem.
5	AH-Mazing!! Great food, great drinks. We've been here about four times. Sometimes there's a wait but that's because it's sooooo good!!
5	This is probably the best tapas place I've been to, my boyfriend and I was there for 2 straight dinners during our stay in Vegas. Everything we ordered was delicious, the lamp chops were the best !  If you like food with an oriental/Chinese twist, I'd highly recommend crispy duck and garden salad. We also tried the highly praised stuffed dates from my fellow Yelpers, it's no doubt the yummiest among its kind.  I'm really impressed with their chef, who according to our waiter is from Mexico. The food is anything but Mexican, which works out with me since I was never a Mexican food fan. The only downside is that it's not that close to the strip, quite some walk to get there from flamingo & Vegas intersection. But it well worths the effort !
4	Reservations were made using Open Table and when we arrived, I had to show them the email confirmation.  The hostess didn't show us in the system and the place is quite small, (we were told in advance we needed reservations due to the size), after showing the email, she seemed putt off with us, but eventually sat us. We had a party of three and all of us differ in what we prefer for good eats.  Firefly satisfied all, immensely. That's the joy of a Tapas bar, you can order several items, get a small taste of everything as a opposed to one huge meal that you may or may not enjoy and have to get through.  Bacon wrapped stuffed dates and the Shrimp, Steak, and Chorizo Skewers in Salsa Verde being the highlight of all the tapas ordered.  We also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (recommended by another bar tender on the strip) and were surprised by the flavor in it.  The waiter mentioned that they let the Sangria sit a few days to allow the fruity flavors to come out, quite delicious.I am looking forward to another trip to Firefly when I'm in town next time.
5	Went there again, this time with my wife, and confirmed that yes, this is a great place for a date.  My wife is both gluten and dairy free, and was able to find plenty of things she could eat (tip: they will leave out the blue cheese on the stuffed dates).Refreshingly un-Vegas and mostly locals.
5	My brother told me about this place. He said "You must have the stuffed dates". They are a must! Ever since I was stationed in Panama with my husband, I have searched for good empanadas. OMG!! I finally found them! This place is one of the best food places in Vegas. The food is cooked to order and served very hot. I ordered the red Sangria and it is incredibly delicious. I recommend ordering a pitcher. The fresh bits of apple are so good.  My favorites on the menu are the dates, empanadas and lamb chops. They season the chops perfectly with a wonderful sear on them. They melt in your mouth. Their garlic fries are addicting.They are open late and service is amazing. Every time I am in Vegas, this place is always on my list. It's busy but a romantic place. It's a tapas bar, so you can try lots of food and not spend lots of money. Every mouthful of food is an experience and it makes you want to come back again and again. Thanks brother! You got this one really right!
5	Every. Single. Thing. I tried was delicious.Sorry, its annoying when people write like that but I was trying to convey my point. I picked this spot for a dinner during a business trip with coworkers. I wanted something off the strip with a lot of variety and this place had promising ratings. I can't remember everything we had because we started ordering a bunch of different tapas off the menu. I do remember delicious empanadas and patatas bravas though! Their sangria is a must try! I had a reservation, so we were promptly seated even though we were missing a couple of people. Service was fairly quick even though this place was packed for a Wednesday night. Thank you to all the Yelpers who led me to this place. I impressed the big bosses and they left with a new favorite restaurant to visit during future visits! Please get off the strip for a bit and visit this place - you will not regret it!!
5	This place is the shiiiiiiiiit.My first time in Las Vegas, so we decided to go off the strip and get some tapas. I've had the real thing in Spain so I was a little cautious as to their food and what they considered "authentic tapas." The place is very quiet and intimate, which was a great departure from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Do I remember what I ate? Nope. All I know is that every single thing I had was delicious. The sangria was delicious and very dangerous because it tasted like juice and I had to ask the waiter twice if they had put alcohol in it. The kicker was the dessert, I'm a Nutella stan so I tried the Banana Nutella Sandwich...the gates of heaven opened, angels sang, and my life is complete. I would recommend reservations just in case.
4	Definitely do yourself a solid, go here with your significant other and enjoy the awesome food!We got sooo much stuff  can't remember, everything was fast, hot and delicious. The Sangria was on point, spicy shrimp was baller and the banana's foster is out of this world.Great service and fast cooks!
3	Small plates not so much..  Order one or two plates less as the portion size is huge!  Food is ok.
4	One of the first restaurants I enjoyed in Vegas, sober. The happy hour is awesome--half price drinks including the pitchers of sangria. So by the end of the meal--not so sober, but still happily so.All the food is small plates (thus "tapas"). The bacon-wrapped dates are incredible. My date and I ordered two plates full. It comes in six. The garlic/pimento spread that comes with the bread upon arrival is tasty. The pear martini is awesome--Grey Goose, pear puree. And half price during happy hour. The white sangria is delicious and full of green apple bits. It could use less ice, but who am I to argue with a restaurant in a desert city?The lamp skewers were well done. The tuna tartare was incredible too.Ambiance: the service is quick, the lighting is a bit on the dim side (think candlelight and red overheads), and the art works are eye-catching. Coming  back the next time I'm in Vegas.
5	Each dish is exquisitely prepared, promptly brought to the table, and delicious! I can recommend the following:- Tuna tartare- STUFFED DATES**!! (i don't even like dates... and this is my favorite dish at firefly)- Tomato basil soup- nothing too special, but a solid dish- Manchego mac and cheese- Ahi Tuna Skewer- didn't realize the tuna would be cooked in this dish, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it. Refreshing flavors and the only cooked tuna dish I've ever enjoyed in a restaurant- Blueberry mojito!- The bread brought to the table is nothing special, but the spread it is served with is really good (:5 stars for the food quality and creativity alone. Not much to say about service. Oh, no outside drinks.
5	Good friend of mine turned me onto this place, try to make it out there every time I'm in town..Service typically seems good, never had a complaint..The food is amazing here, I wish I could stuff myself more than possible..highly recommend Stuffed dates, don't think I've ever had dates before this place..Then there's a bunch of other great items, steak skewers with mushrooms are solid.One thing I really hate about this place is it can get packed and wait times can be insanely long with no reservations.
4	Finally made it out to Firefly on our last Vegas trip. The food was good - loved the mussels in curry sauce and the sangria the most. However, the service was very confusing! After a few minutes of being seated, a waiter came up to ask us if we've been helped. The tables aren't assigned? After that, it was hard to find the guy, and he forgot one of our orders. When we told him that he forgot, he said oh I'm sorry and stared at us as if to ask what we'd like him to do. Anyway, at least the food was good!
5	Some of the best tap food I have had, a definite hidden gem of Las Vegas. Worth the trip off the strip, the chicken salad was great and the chocolate cherry bread pudding is awfully tasty.
4	I'm a huge fan of customer service, and this place was top notch. If anything the waiter was doing above and beyond his job. He was consistently refilling and double checking that we were doing good. It's sad, but I've truly come to appreciate the people in this town that ACTUALLY do their jobs and don't mope around and spread their negativity on the floor. The only thing I could say I disliked about this place would be the annoying, theater table of 20+ drunk people. You would think maybe a manager would have approached them after they consistently sang songs and yelled random sayings, but I understand where they were coming from, and hey, I mean the people looked like they were having a good time, even though everyone surrounding them were highly annoyed. All in all I absolutely love this place, and I'm going to have to say you absolutely have to try the bacon wrapped date with goat cheese and the sangria!
4	Great experience.  I recommend anyone in Vegas make this one of the places you stop to eat.  It is great food, great service and great atmosphere.  I would consider this one of the places locals would go to eat.  There isn't any inflated prices you see on the strip so if you want a great time without the typical inflated costs so many good restaurants in Las Vegas have, this will be a nice surprise for you too.
1	Wayyyy too salty! ! Couldn't even enjoy it:-( Got the Warm Spinach Salad & Eggplant canoli. The Eggplant was so little, could barely taste it. Plus it was drowning in goat cheese that didn't even taste good with the eggplant. The salad was so salty that it was hard to finish.
4	WOW.. we found out about this place on Yelp.. and decided to check it out.  It was just like people said.  Delicious and well priced.. with M M M good drinks.We did go fairly early but there was still a nice vibe.  I wish this place was closer to me.YUM!
5	Excellent, fairly affordable tapas in Las Vegas. A hidden gem that's definitely worth leaving the Strip.
5	LOve this Place forTapas, Drinks, & the First date... Sometimes a bit too loud for first date but very comfortable atmosphere . Not too Pricie  $$ is Fair
5	I love this place and have been going here regularly for seven years since I moved to Las Vegas. I know the menu like the back of my hand, and I'm glad to see that they have been improving and expanding to areas like Henderson and Summerlin. Fun atmosphere, and delicious. I always bring my out of town friends here and they are impressed every time. Five Stars! *Yum!*
4	Love, love, love this place. Fabulous tapas, great atmosphere, and the sangria is delish. They make all sorts of fresh fruit sangrias. Try the dates - you won't regret it!  I try to get here whenever I am in Vegas. Great atmosphere - very fun, upbeat place...It's located in a strip mall and parking can be tight.
5	Fantastic food, very reasonably priced. Good service. Highly recommend.
4	I have been to Firefly more times than I can remember. It's the place for old friends to reunite and for new friends to bond over delicious sangria and food. The concept of tapas is just really fun. It's even more fun when you have several people and can try a little of everything. My only peeve about this location is the parking (which I believe they recently solved by providing more parking in the back of the building complex, however, in that part of town and at night, no thank you) and the small, cramped space that is the restaurant. Besides that, LOVE IT.These are my go-to menu items that I order basically EVERY time I visit:FIREFLY FRIES: Nothing special about the fries themselves, however the parmesan, herbs, and seasonings that they throw on it? YUM. It's also served with their menu-popular aioli. It's pretty amazing.STUFFED DATES: What can you hate about a date stuffed with creamy bleu cheese and a smoked almond, wrapped in bacon, and roasted in the oven, then served with a perfectly-sweet red wine reduction? Yeah, nothing.EMPANADA: Every culture offers some sort of pastry stuffed with meat and/or vegetables that is baked, fried, or boiled and it is always delicious. This one does not disappoint with its roasted pork, red peppers, topped with aioli, and served with a tangy salad. When you're done eating it, your only complaint will be that there was just ONE.TUNA TARTARE: A delicious stack of raw tuna with avocado, mixed with a soy sauce concoction and served with crispy taro chips! A light and fun dish.PAELLA: I understand that I will never know the true meaning of paella until I venture to Spain (as I'm told by my well-traveled friends), but of all the restaurants that I've had paella, this is one of the best. It has all your main players like chorizo, chicken, calamari, mussels, etc and of course, the heart: saffron rice. It's served in the pot that it's cooked in, so it's hot until you leave.All the sangria choices are delicious, but my personal favorite is definitely the SPARKLING SANGRIA. I love having carbonation in my beverage and this is sweet and delicious. Go before 6 pm (I'm not sure when it starts) and you can enjoy half off your pitcher during their Happy Hour!I have been twice since my Vegan/Vegetarian journey has begun, so my meals have been significantly different. Sadly, there's only a couple Vegan (non-confirmed, just assumed) tapas and besides one, all salads. Not exciting at all. So, I decided that if I wanted to eat, I had to consume some dairy. I've tried: ARTICHOKE TOASTS: artichoke hearts with aioli, basil, pepper on their delicious toasted bread, very good; VEGGIES AND LENTILS: Just meh and totally could have done without it (the one rare, possibly, Vegan dish); VEGGIE EMPANADA: Also just meh - the cream cheese was overwhelming and I had no desire to finish it; PATATAS BRAVAS: Very yummy, but spicy, so you've been warned. Therefore, being restricted to a Vegetarian/Vegan diet makes this place very bland. It's still one of my favorite restaurants, so maybe one day we can meet (meat) again.BTW, all three locations in the valley accept reservations except on Fridays and Saturdays (I'm sure there are other exceptions like holidays perhaps). So if it's the weekend, ensure you arrive early if you're dining with a large group or try a weekday!
5	Stumbled on this place by accident..Thank God we did!  Plates were flavorful and plentiful.  Drinks weren't overpriced, and it had a great atmosphere.  Favorites were the stuffed dates and the clams and chorizo.  My wife went crazy for the gazpacho!  What a great night out, we will be back!
4	I can't tell you how happy we were that our La Quinta is just down the street.  For the two of us, we ordered 8 tapas and a dessert.  Definitely too much...wished I had a second stomach.  Anyways, it's so much a better deal than another tapas restaurant we found on the strip.  It might not be the most authentic Spanish food (Duck Eggroll?), but the food is delicious...a great value and find off the strip.
4	This is one place that has become a staple in my Las Vegas path of culinary travel.A large and creating array of small plate items, covering the gamut, from comfort foods, to meat/fish, hot/cold, lite/heavy, etc...There is something for everyone here.I am partial to the albongigas (meatballs), but the tuna tartare is great, as are the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp diablo, ceviche....I could go on, but try it for yourself.Casual, eclectic atmosphere makes it comfortable for anybody. I've been here for business meetings, been here dressed up for pre and post nite-out bites, and been here in sweatpants. Never any judgement.Full bar, and prices are reasonable too. I've been to 3 of their locations, but the one on Paradise is my favorite. Just a comfortable spot to enjoy good food.
3	I think I've eaten at Firefly one too many times to give it an objective review, but here goes.As far as solid tapas and group dining goes, you'll have a pretty good experience at Firefly. Some of my favorites are the perennial staple: the bacon wrapped dates, boquerones, artichoke toasts and tomato soup (w/brie grilled cheese). The menu has changed minimally since I first visited about 6 years ago and I wish they'd give some thought to additions. Yes, they have a lot on the menu, but like I said I've eaten there so much that it's a little difficult to give an objective review.I haven't been able to find sangria as good as Firefly's anywhere. I don't know what their secret is, but they better not let it out. You can get it by the glass or by the pitcher and if you drink like me, the pitcher isn't a bad deal.The service can be apathetic and awkward at best and negligent at worst. Several times I've dined there and have been tempted to not leave a tip because service is SO bad. I get that they are busy, but it's time to figure out a new strategy, hire people who care and give that service experience the attention it needs.This is a good place for a date (not a first date because it's so damn loud in there), a group dinner (although they hate those and it's so obvious) or to take someone who's never had tapas before. I know I'll be back and my expectations will be managed.
5	Great food, reasonable prices, great ambiance with a cool, hip vibe. I have been coming here for years and never been disappointed. It's off the strip, but totally worth the cab fare. Some notable menu items: Sangria and the mojitos...goes without saying ;-)Machego Mac n cheesestuffed peppersapple manchego saladartichoke toastscroquetasstuffed dates (OMG!!)filet slidersbanana nutella sandwiches (amazeballs)I have had most of the menu items...they are all really good.
4	Came here with great friends on our vegas trip.  It was my first time trying tapas. It was really good.  Restaurant looked small but had plenty of seating and service was good. We tried a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed the sliders and the Mac and cheese. Both were well done.  We ordered the firefly fries and there was plenty to last for the whole meal for all of us. The date wrapped with bacon was so good.  We got a pitcher of sangria. Which was plenty for four. Sangria was too strong for me but I know others will enjoy the amount of alcohol. We finished with the Nutella sandwiches which was amazing. Only thing I really didn't like was the cold chorizo meat platter. I was not a fan.
4	We really like this place. A lot of bang for your buck. We get everything here, especially all the tapas. Everything is good here & drinks are good. Nice atmosphere & service. A must on every Vegas trip. Wish we had one here in CA.
4	This place is pretty much amazing and you need to get here when it's not busy or you'll be waiting in line like you would be at a club but everyone is there for table service. Service is amazing and cups of water are never empty.This is what we ordered:1) stuffed dates - bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese2) firefly fries - parmesan, herbs, aioli3) veggie empanada - spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in pastry, red pepper aioli4) filet mignon sliders - mini burgers w/serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions5) crispy duck roll - cherry hoisin sauce6) fried calamari - spicy gribiche dipping sauceI would recommend all these things except the crispy duck roll. It just was not good--dry and bland. I wanted to try the Sangria but I was driving back home that day so I didn't intake any EtOH. It looked tasty though.Firefly serves some of the best tapas in my opinion. Definitely a place that's worth a 4 or 5-people cab ride since it's off the strip.
4	Catching up on a previous visit.  Went here for dinner during my business trip and was pleasantly surprised by the inexpensive costs, friendly atmosphere, and the vibrant crowd.  Great find in the area. Tips: perfect spot for groups (there's something for everyone). The tapas are amazing. They have a happy hour ;) and save room for dessert!
3	Disappointed. First time went there on Friday night.. A lot of people, but we made reservation, we got our table right away once we walked in, which is very good. The flavor of the food was decent, but either they have made some shortcut of that night or that's normal for them, certain food wasn't fresh, warm spinach salad - there are some mushy and old spinach leaves.steam mussels - not bad, but the red curry was missing some hearty flavor to it.  stuffed mushroom - taste decentmeatball - texture was good.babyback ribs - the sauce/glaze was pretty good, but the texture was not, it seems like the ribs have been refrigerated for a long time and get forgotten.lamb chop - this is finefilet mignon sliders - overbooked, dry and the fries/onion strings was so soggy, it looks like microwave from overnight onion strings. Baked tetilla - a bit bland, need a bit more seasoning.
5	1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars? I had to try this place. Plus, it gave me another excuse for tapas! No reservations for Fri or Sat- but they take them any other day of the week.Sooo- we came on a Sunday instead. We had made reservations ahead of time and were promptly seated. For being a Sunday night during off-season, the place was still pretty crowded. There is very low lighting- so if you expect some amazing phone photos of your food, probably not going to happen unless you drown it in a flash.There were a ton of things that we wanted to try on the menu and the server gladly explained his pros/cons on each of our choices while recommending some of his own. There was no rush, but he continually checked in with us to see if we were ready or had any other inquiries. I was glad there were four of us- we really pigged out.While we waited, we went for their house sangria. Though I'm not a wine person, it was pretty fantastic. It was light and fruity, but after glass two, I was definitely feeling a nice buzz. We ordered a pitcher for the four of us and it was probably the better deal since we each got about two glasses out of it. If you're not lightweights like us, a pitcher between two people would probably be sufficient, too. It's definitely a great drink while enjoying your food.We inhaled:Serrano Sliders: Filet mignon with serrano ham, grilled onions and clouds of heaven. Not the menu description, but I think I heard angels singing when I bit into them. They were super moist, cooked medium and the cheese was melted perfectly in the soft, yet crispy bun. These were so amazing that I'll probably compare every other slider experience in the future to these little things.Manchengo Mac and Cheese: Came out in a little skillet that was still bubbling when served. It was crispy on top with a generous amount of bread crumbs. It wasn't too cheesy and split between four people, it was just enough without weighing us down. I loved the strong taste of the cheese and liked that it was so gooey without being watery. Even if there were two of us, I'd still probably order it again.Stuffed Dates: These sweet things were stuffed with blue cheese and then wrapped in bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked with some nice crispy fat and it was unanimous that it was the favorite dish of the night.It comes in a serving of 5, so we all got one and I got an extra. I'm seriously salivating thinking of the sweet and savory combination and wish that they had a location in CA for me to indulge in... but it's probably better that they don't.Firefly Fries: It's a generous portion served with melted parmesan cheese on top. For dipping, it comes with aioli. The french fries were crispy and I loved the oil that they were cooked in. It didn't even really need the sauce that accompanied it and it was plenty for the four of us.Albondigas: These were like mini meatballs with the tomato sauce and parmesan sprinkled on top. They were delicious and moist and held some great flavors. As soon as they hit the table, we pretty much inhaled it. Definitely worth getting.Empanadas: A hit as well. Really enjoyed the flaky pastry outside and the super moist pork inside. The peppers gave it a nice little kick, but nothing a swig of sangria couldn't extinguish. It was so good, I again forgot to use the dipping sauce that came with it.Baked Tetilla: Just like the description says, it's fondue- so super cheese. It comes with crisp pieces of toast to spread the combo of cheese, tomato and chorizo on. We saved it and continued to dip our fries in it after the bread was gone. There was no way in hell we were going to let any go to waste!Fried Calamari: This was good, but standard calamari. It was good, but I would opt for something a little more adventurous next time.Tierra y Mar Skewers: Little kebobs with shrimp, filet and chorizo. I loved the charred tasted from the grill. The combination of these three proteins was pretty genius, each meat was delicious on their own and even better together.Chorizo Plate: Different types of thinly sliced chorizo served on a plate with capers. This was probably our least favorite dish. It wasn't bad, but we shouldn't have ended with it. It would have worked better as one of our beginning courses. It wasn't bad, but we had a bunch of hearty samples and this was light and salty. Banana and Nutella Sandwiches: Now this was the perfect way to end a meal. It was like crack and we almost ordered a second serving because it was so damn good. It was like french toast with bananas on the inside. Add in the nutella and it was the dessert of the gods. Super simple but extra delicious. This is a must if you're in the mood for a sweet finale.Service was impeccable. Someone constantly came around to clear our plates and refill drinks. This place deserves a 6th star and will become one of my regular Las Vegas stops for sure!
5	This was a great little place tucked away off the strip. The food came out really fast and was packed with flavor. It was perfect to share with a ton of variety. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed! The Sangria and Mojitos were awesome as well!I'd definitely return here for a great deal!
3	If I had actually sat down at a table to have a decent meal, maybe I would have given more stars. But they were so crowded that we had to eat at the bar, 7 people with 3 seats. While you need a coat outside, inside was so hot and humid that we were sweating bullets. Just tried to eat as fast as possible and get the hell outta there!  You just can't enjoy food when being rushed, especially when the food is just OK at best. I don't need to come off the strip for this. The plates all sound intriguing, but the taste is kind of one note, like they had a list of spices and HAD to use all of them in EVERY dish. I honestly cannot remember what I had because everything tasted about the same and sorta blended together, not to mention way salty.
5	The place is small but really nice. I loved the food and drinks. I must return here. This place is a little hidden diamond chip. But its a nice little romantic spot to relax with your boo. You have got to eat this food! You have got to dance here. Try the blueberry mojitos!
3	Food was very good, service was non-existant.  We waited for 20 minutes after dinner to get coffee and we waited for 30 minutes for the check.  If we had service, it would have been 5 stars.
5	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food is delicious. I was in there this evening, and had the best service  in a long time. My boyfriend and I were celebrating a special occasion and our waiter went above and beyond to make it a wonderful evening. He was informative, kind, and attentive. Thank you Jesus Eduardo!
4	Sounds like this place gets pretty packed. We were in town for a wedding, so we had our 2- and 5-year-old with us and we went at 2pm on a Friday--no wait and we didn't feel weird with our kids at that time of day. Our kids liked the Mac & Cheese, the Apple Salad, and all the Crostinis. Plenty of small items to choose from if you happen to bring your kids like we did.Some items were a huge hit, and some things were just good. Sounds like the bacon-wrapped dates are the way to go, and it's true, they are pretty amazing--something you'll crave. I also loved the shrimp with chili sauce; lots of spice and flavor. We were full but wanted a taste of dessert, so we ordered the Dessert Platter amongst the six of us. We should've ordered another one because we loved all the little desserts. The popular ones were the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Passion Fruit Cheesecakes--I want to go back and order one of those just for myself.
5	Great food, cool atmosphere! Worth the trip off the strip. The food came fast, knowledgeable server.
4	Back in town, and made this my dinner stop.  Even on Sundays they're open til 2a.  We ordered the potato brava, their fries, shrimp diablo, the bacon wrapped dates, chicken skewers, and the nutella banana sandwich.  The biggest standout was def the dates!  Just wow, the saltiness of the bacon, sweetness of the date, and the nut in the middle...Nothing I ate here even compares.  The shrimp diablo's sauce was particularly good as well as the nutella banana sandwich....I'd def  order the dessert again.  But the dates were incredible.  Don't come here and not try it.
5	The food is excellent, place is very nice and staff was very good.  It gets busy so make a reservation if possible.  The tapas were great, ceviche was amazing.  Must try, I will come back when I am back in Vegas.
5	Yes! The coveted 5 star rating. Why? How, you ask? Here are the deets my friends.Food: Just from the complimentary bread, you already become charmed by Fireflys gastronomy. Smoked almond butter, olives, and spiced orange segments are perfect companions to the bread that was served. House made empanadas with its buttery crust, and deliciously braised pork filling hit a special place in my heart. Clams, chorizo and a savory tomato broth was memorable flavor as well. Service: The service here is like a well oiled machine. On top of everything from refills on bread/drinks, knowledge of the menu as well as alertness. Our server was warm and genuinely took pride in the work he was doing. Ambience: Spacious and dimly lit. It was festive but intimate at the same time. Dark wood and warmly painted walls transports you to Spain.Verdict: Firefly rates up there with some of the best eats in Vegas.
5	This place is fantastic from all angles. Love the tapas experience. It can get pricey quick but the selection and ability to have a little bit of everything is welcomed in this tapas setting. If you have at least 3-4 people makes it a lot easier to try many things. Sangria is also quite good. Food is real tasty and satisfies all appetites. It is a great place socially but that also means it tends to be very busy. It is worth the wait in my opinion. Have been going there for years now and appears to be the De facto place for my friends and I to celebrate birthdays.
5	I have gone to this place for Happy Hour for years. It is definitely my favorite place to hang out after work with friends. I always have the sangria. I haven't found any better in Vegas. The tapas are delectable. I always order the empanadas, stuffed dates, tortillas, and the patatas bravas. If I'm with a seafood fan, I also get the calamari. I've had the paella as an entree and it was quite tasty as well. You can't go wrong at Firefly.
4	It was very crowded and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. I take that as a good thing it means people love it there and are willing to wait for a table. Go grab a drink at the bar while you wait. Mojitos are very good. The food itself was very good! Do yourself a favor and get the baby back ribs!!!!  My only real complaint was that the table it not nearly big enough for the drinks and numerous plates they bring but again when you taste the food the wait, crowd, and over stuffed table are small potatoes. Lastly, as a DIE HARD Foo fan... They have taken the classic FF logo and made their own firefly shirts. Very clever!
5	We love Firefly! Came for the ceviche and sangria. Service is always good but today it was over the top because of Jesus E (Lalo). He made our experience extra special tonight. Thanks Jesus!
3	I do like this restaurant, but I am not sure what the big hype is all about. The food is good but in my opinion the taste is not worth the price. There is just nothing about the flavor that makes this restaurant stand out. So either every time I have gone there I order the wrong things (doubtful) or there really is nothing that stands out about their food. I am from the Netherlands, which is not too far from Spain (where everyone always goes for vacation), and have had amazing Spanish food before that the food at Firefly's does not even come close to measuring up to. The only thing I have had that I would ever go back to eat that is completely worth it is their ribeye entree. Makes up for all the other dishes, like the flavorless paella. Other than that the restaurant is beautiful and upscale compared to the average restaurant. Perfect place to take a date for the second or third time (might be too expensive for the first if you are a poor university student like me) or to have a dinner celebration. The staff was wonderful. If you are just looking for a good eatery and aren't eating out for any special occasion, I probably wouldn't suggest this place.
2	I have been here maybe 3 times. Each time I went I thought, "Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes. I should try something else next time." Bad idea. I know that the last time I was there was about 2 years ago but it really left a bad taste in my mouth. I have been going to the other Fireflies in Summerlin and that's better than the original.I have never had to return a dish in my life but this had to go. I order a stuffed mushroom dish that came out cold and under seasoned. The fries were good. I forgot what else I ordered but I would recommend to go to the Summerlin Fireflies for a better experience.
3	FAST_VIEW: friendly atmosphere, tasty food, fast service but can easily break the bank.pros: every dish was solid, vodka shots were infused with flavor and delight!cons: every dish was expensive and not particularly outstanding. simply solid. list of items can be overwhelminggetting here before 5 will beat the crowd on a weekend, which is quite large! by the time we left, a mob had formed a line outside. we were surprised.here's what we ordered: scallops, empanada, eggplant, & a vodka shot which amounted to about $30. that's not too bad if you think about it.here's the problem: that was probably enough food for a 10 year old. ah he can have a shot, its chocolate, lychee, strawberry infused! delightful!the scallops were flavorful!! but seriously tasted like 2 and a half scallops. empanada was tasty but you pay a hefty price for ONE, sliced in half so we actually thought there were 2 at first. the eggplant with goat cheese was tasty but also small. i completely understand this is a tapas place and we appreciated the portion sizes actually. my girlfriend and i tend to share every meal, but at $6-$12 a dish, even with our light appetites we would've had to spend $70 to be just full. i imagine the people with normal appetites.so while this place is tasty, i think i'd only come back for the vodka shots. and i'd like to try those filet mignon sliders yelpers have been raving about. ;)
5	Great vegetarian food! Had a good time sharing all the tapas with the family. The drinks were very good as well. The one fish dish we ordered from the entree (with mango) was pretty bad - recommend you send the dish back to the cook if you aren't happy. Overall a pleasant experience - had to leave the strip but it's not that far.
5	Awesome food!  Will definitely try this again on my next trip to Vegas!
5	Firefly is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in Las Vegas! I have been to Spain and had Tapas there. Firefly is the most authentic I have had in the States! Their menu is very extensive. Their lobster stuffed mushroom is simply delightful!
5	Okay I've been here enough times now to forgive the credit card incident. Each time I've been back to Firefly the service has been as perfect as the food. Firefly is the first place I recommend to friends visiting Vegas since there's a variety of flavors to choose from and the pricing is very fair. Also what's not to like about pitchers of sangria.. New favorite must-order dishes:Ceviche - LOVE this dish. A simple but refreshing combo of cold shrimp, lime, tomatoes, onion, and avocado served with crispy tortilla strips. Mango BBQ ribs - Not something I would usually order but the ribs were extremely tender and the sauce was sweet and savory. Also the portion is huge! So good.Evenings are their busiest times but each time I've been for lunch there's been no wait!
5	Firefly gets a 5 star for its combination of great menu that is approachable to both vegetarians and meat eaters alike and also for its atmosphere.Don't miss the gazpacho!
5	Firefly is my one must visit when I am in Vegas.Last night was no exception - food was 'stop-the-conversation' ridiculously good.Bacon wrapped dates - just perfect.Chorizo and Chicken stuffed mushrooms - amazingFilet and mushroom skewers - grilled perfectly, just wonderfulAnd as far as value goes, I have taken 6 people to dinner with plenty of Sangria and Mojitos and walked out for around $50 a person and had clients high-fiving each other.Go to Firefly, you will not regret it.
5	Great menu, fast service, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices. This place is always packed, but our wait time was minimal, and once we were seated, service was really good, and really fast without making us feel rushed at all. The food was very good. The only caveat I'd make is that the traditional tapas, especially the empanadas and croquetas are not as good as we had in Spain, but that is being awfully picky. They were some of the best we have had outside of Spain, by far. There are more vegetarian options than average, too. If I go back to Vegas, this is one of only two restaurants I'd bother to revisit, after spending two weeks there in the last 2 years.
5	Amazing since the late nineties. Still is in 2013.
5	Been twice, and ready to go my next trip to Vegas. Great selection of small plates, Tapas, always crowded. Food comes fast. Great off the strip happening spot. Good prices.!
5	FAVORITE RESTAURANT ! This place is a local gem it is the best food and drinks and atmosphere. UNLV even voted it best bar. Their sangria is delicious all three flavors so are their mojitos I love the paradise mojito is my favorite it is a pineapple coconut mojito its so tasty. The food is phenomenal and delicious I love love love the stuffed dates you can't eat just one order the baby beet salad is great their fries are great so is their steamed mussels and their tres leche cake for dessert is great so is their flan ! Everything I have ever eaten here has been delicious. It is also wonderful for happy hour 3 - 6 half off everything and it is always busy it is a good spot for singles to mingle and also a great romantic spot for couples! Great atmosphere very spanish sometimes they have a live spanish guitar player and he is wonderful.
5	wow. this place is SPECTACULAR. exceeded my already high expectations with the insane quality of ingredients, friendly service, unique flavors, and affordable prices. to start, the free bread appetizer was delicious. comes with this sweet butter thing. dont know what it is but i want moarshrimp ceviche came first.. sadly it was way too acidic for my taste and some of the chips were stale. however, the rest of the meal would more than made up for it...-scallop escargot: perfect texture, GREAT flavor!! so effing delicious!-mushroom with puff pastry: whatever sauce they used on the mushrooms brought out the flavor of the mushroom PERFECTLY... the light and airy puff pastry was a perfect complement to the stronger but delicious flavor of the mushroom-lamb chops: so full of flavor and cooked to an exact medium rare as requested... a tiny bit too salty for my taste but delicious nonetheless -chocolate tres leches cake: wow. i've only ever had tres leches cake with white cake before but i much prefer the chocolate version. the combo of the chocolate with the milk was the perfect union of sweet desserty flavors. such an amazing way to end the meal its a little off the strip but TRUST ME...its worth the short drive/cab ride to check this place out. i actually walked 1.5 mi from planet hollywood and it wasnt that bad albeit kind of a ghetto walk haha. also i hear the sangrias and mojitos are amazing too
5	This was the first Firefly that I visited and I loved it the first time and I continue to love it to this day! The location on Paradise is great because its close to the strip so if you have visitors in town you should take them off the strip and to this great restaurant! I love sitting out on the patio on summer nights if seats are available. This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go out to dinner too. I love that it isn't a chain and is one of a kind. Even though their sangria is very popular the mojito is where its at. My favorite mojito is mango although their passion fruit and blueberry are in close second and third. I love that all of their plates are small portions. I love going with a group of friends or family and choosing many plates. That way you can sample much of their menu without getting too full. My favorite chilled tapa on the menu has to be the apple manchango salad. If you haven't tried it yet it is a must! Their petite filet is also a must try! If you are vacationing in Vegas or just a local this is a restaurant you will have to try!
3	Call me crazy but I'm not that crazy about Firefly. The food is mediocre to me and there's only a few things that I enjoy eating there which is the bread and the ceviche. You can't really screw those two up. I know the first time I went there I had the petite filet and I was not impressed at all. And I'm a sucker for filet mignon! It was so bland and just....blah. The only thing I absolutely LOVE is their red sangrias! Good Lord have mercy! Only thing I would go there for! As for their food, I'd rather pass.
4	It was a very nice change from dining on the strip.There were a few menu items that i didnt care too much for like the stuffed dates and lamb sausage, but everything else was great. After eating the rest of the week at casino restaurants we were shocked that our meal with one sangria and dessert was under $50. Ask for a sample of the red and white sangria and the waiter will give you almost a free glass worth!
5	Incredible. Bacon wrapped dates, Mac n cheese, sorrano sliders, crispy duck, ham and cheese crocquetas, ceviche, French fries. Eat it all!

5	I just cannot say enough about this place. Do yourself a favor and leave the strip and go find this place. It is not far from the strip, but far enough away that you don't pay ridiculous prices and don't deal with 20 year old obnoxious drunks.Came here with my wife for Valentines Day and were seated promptly. It was happy hour, so we had the most amazing sangria and cosmo, and a few rounds of them. We also tried their house-made infused vodka, which was really quite something.The tapas is what makes this place 5 stars, but the wait staff is also extraordinary. Extremely attentive, we never went without drinks, water or anything. Top notch. For tapas we ordered stuffed dates, tomato soup which came with a brie grilled cheese sandwich, veggie empanada, mac and cheese made with manchego cheese, mini filet mignon, herb cheese, roast potato, mushrooms and red wine sauce and shrimp tempura. Keep in mind it is tapas, so although it seems like a ton of food, it was just right. I can't say enough about the food. This meal was the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Intimate, not noisy, some of the best food that I have ever had and great waitstaff. Don't skip this place!
5	We ate at ramseys steak the night before - here is my 2 star review of that place which i will never eat at again.  The wine list is a bit overpriced - many of our local wines were nearly double in price.  Food service was slow - quoted 45 minutes for meal to be ready (beef Wellington) took close to an hour (we had a show to see -which we informed server - that was 2.5 hours after our reservation time) - don't order Wellington if you have time constraints.  Wellington was nothing special.  Food was good but nothing spectacular.  The price points were high - we had an inexpensive bottle of red and total for 4 was over $400.  The next night we ate at firefly - for 10 people it was nearly $100 cheaper - the food was 10 times better, better service, more variety, better ambiance and overall much better dining experience.  Will never go back to Ramsey's.Did you catch the point where I compared firefly to Ramsey's?  No comparison - firefly is in our top five favorite places we have eaten.  Our entire group had a wonderful dinner - everything was great - from the rod to service.  We showed up at 630 on a Saturday and were seated right away - and everything was wonderful from there on - our favorite was the scallop escargot - but everything had wonderful flavors - will definitely be stopping here on our next trip to Vegas.
3	I liked everything that we tried. We had the lamb skewer, Croquetas, empanada, crispy duck roll, fried calamari, dates wrapped in bacon.The place was nice too, service was good.
5	Service was great. We had to wait for our table but they quickly took an order from us at the bar for appetizers and drinks. The menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent! Great atmosphere!
5	We happened to be lucky enough to have a local with us and she brought us here. It's about a 5 min car ride behind the strip. It's tapas. We had two big guys and three gals in our gang. By the end our tab was $118 and we were STUFFED!We went at about 6 on a Saturday night. There was a 20 min wait so we went to the bar and luckily found 5 seats together. We ordered a pitcher a sangria to share. Oh my goodness did that quench our thirst. It was red wine based with fresh fruit. Scrumptious!! We each were able to get 2 glasses-ish. The hostess came over and showed us to our seats. We were promptly served water and of course ordered another pitcher. After looking at the menu while at the bar we knew what we wanted for our first round. I must say the stuffed dates ARE A MUST!! I was unsure of them but once I ate one I immediately grabbed a second. (In fact we ended up ordering two more on our second round.) Everything we tried was amazing. They were a tad bit slow clearing the plates buys I think that's because we ate them so fast!! The shrimp ceviche and eggplant cannelloni is also worth a mention. Also the sliders were on point. Worth the cab fare.
4	FLASH FRIED PADRON PEPPERSWe made two stops into Firefly on the most recent Vegas trip. Or was it 3? I had been thinking about Padron peppers for over a year. I've tried to find them around the Bay Area, and I tried the flash fried shisito peppers a couple months ago at Covern's Tavern in Walnut Creek, but it just wasn't the same.I've only sat on the back patio at Firefly. Since Vegas has good weather most months of the year, and it's shaded for the hotter ones, I prefer this over the dark indoors. Service is usually pretty standard. They get very busy so it can be slow, but it never seems like I've had to wait too long.  Maybe because they serve small plates the food comes out and gets devoured faster. On the table after you're seated is place bread with almond butter and a couple of olives. We like to add a plate of fries, a plate of salad, a hot plate of some sort, and of course... my peppers ($5.50). The mojitos are great here but a pitcher will run $30 unless you're here during happy hour when it's half off.
5	The food, the drinks, the ambiance, the staff, the place, the price... oh, how I just love this place! I go here once a week. I love this place! A MUST TRY!
5	After first dining here several years ago, we were excited to return when we stayed off-the-strip.  It was a busy, hoppin' joint, but we got a nice table right away.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We had several dishes, which were all so delicious.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the sauces were nice, and the vegetables were fresh.  My only complaint was that it all came out so quickly, I would have rather lingered over small courses.  We shared a pitcher of sangria, and we sadly could not finish it all, very generous pitcher.  The sangria was stellar, with nice chunks of fruit floating within.
5	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Always great service - quick service, and very friendly and attendant staff.The only downside is that the wait can be a little long on busy nights and if you have a big group (understandable for any place) but they're very good about getting tables cleaned up to help the next party.GREAT food. Pretty good sized menu of tapas, and nothing is ever bland. So much flavor to choose from! Whatever your taste it, I'm pretty sure you'd find something that you'd like.The mojitos are freakin' BOMB. If you like bread pudding, theirs a must-try!:)
5	Cheap food and booze? Im in!Got to love Firefly for many reasons besides the cheap dishes and booze! The atmosphere, people and servers make it all meld together perfectly.Most dishes here are delicious and the one i was particularly fond of was the lamb chops! Two for about $10?! Amazing! Check out my Firefly food pictures among other on my Instagram! @dentalgaymer
5	My favorite tapas restaurant in Vegas.  The Sangria is to die for and I love the eggplant with goat cheese, beef and mushroom skewers and of course the paella!
5	I have been here a few times now and it has only gotten better. It is a Spanish Tapas restaurant off of the strip with very sensual red lighting and amazing food. I am a big fan of the chicken skewers and the filet mignon especially. The sauces are amazing!!! The strawberry mojitos are off the charts. Super fresh, there is actually real strawberry in it. I love the lemon berry tarts and mini cheesecake!! Very tasty and the serving size is not huge. There's a super neat fish tank in there too. The service is very good, you are never stranded. Firefly will always have a very special place in my heart for more reasons than one.
4	The bacon wrapped stuff dates are awesome! More proof that you can wrap most anything in bacon!
5	Favorite restaurant in a week of great restaurants while visiting Las Vegas for a conference earlier this month! Plan to wait... but the staff is really accommodating and will call you on the phone/ hold your table for a few minutes if you aren't front and center when your name is called. I recommend visiting Kelly's down the way and getting a drink while you wait. So on to other stuff...This place is super crowded. The menu is not huge but literally everything is great so it's tough to make decisions. Our party of 6 ordered one or two things each and shared in true tapas style. Prawns were a particular hit, as were the skewers. My favorite was the ceviche, which had avocado in it (I don't even like avocado and I still loved it!). I hear the sangria is amazing and I really regret not getting it. I did however order a few desserts to share, and all were  well received. We tried the bread pudding and the dessert platter (cheesecake, tarts, tres leches). The bread pudding was the favorite, as well as the cheesecake.Enough talk- go eat here!
4	My boyfriend was feeling an Ibiza themed night. After having a lazy Sunday soaking in the sun at the pool we started to talk about dinner plans.Now I have been to Firefly on a couple of occasions to mainly grab a small bite at the bar and enjoy their great happy hour special. This was my second full dinner and now I can say it has easily become my go-to spot.The decor is a fiery spanish inspired theme with lovely paintings of the flamenco dancers draped on the walls. The room is separated into three dining areas, one inside, separated by the bar, one mid point with a glass wall allowing you to peek outside and another just outside with heat lamps to keep it tolerable on the chillier nights. Firefly is festive with spanish music blasting in the background. It's a fun spot and always busy. Great to go alone or to dine in a small group. Reservations are highly recommended, although most times I've been lucky and was sat right away. The service is spot on at the tables. The food is quick. The bussers are always cleaning up and the servers - (the best is Juan) are always smiling and ready for any question you have. I would have to say the bartenders need some work because I think they live in their own planet and are too busy chatting with each or checking their phones instead of engaging with the guest (from one bartender to another: that's what a guest looks for when they choose to dine at the bar, especially if they are alone)Food. Yummy. Great Value. Quality ingredients.Highly Recommend: Tuna Tartare (some of the best I've ever had and I have it a lot)Bacon wrapped stuffed dates (very heavy so be in the mood) Paella (share, share, & share the goodness.I also recommend their pitcher of Sangria. It was slightly too sweet this time around but they quickly fixed that by bringing us some fresh cut oranges to balance the sweetness (sorry but we are in the service industry and sometimes we can fix the problem ourselves). Mojito's here are fantastic too.Another quality find in Vegas! An attestment to its success is the fact that there are three different locations! Tapas I heart you....
5	The place was jam packed on a Sunday evening at 7:45. We had great service, the bartenders were very attentive and friendly. There was lots of energy and very pleasant atmosphere.  Try the bacon wrapped dates and dip the free bread in the sauce. Yummy!  Very delicious.  This is a great find for both locals and visitors.
3	Not bad.  I'll have to admit I don't get the appeal of Tapas, but the food was more than serviceable.  Major complaint would be how the food came out from the kitchen.  No real rhyme or reason as to how it arrived at our table of 7.
5	The bacon wrapped dates are awesome! Just order them!
5	One of my favorite places to eat. Sparkling sangria and the ham & cheese croquetas are my fav.
5	This place is a hidden gem! Great atmosphere with lovely food. such reasonable pricing for great food. Try the scallops and if you order the firefly fries, make sure you are sharing them! the portion is HUGE!
4	Came here with a group of 7 girls. Thank God we had reservations because there looked to be quite a long line outside. This restaurant is in a strip mall and pretty inconspicuous. Its tapas/small plates so we ordered a ton of different things. I'll try to list out all the ones I can rememberTuna Tartar - Didn't really strike me as Tapas or Spain especially considering the taro chips but it was fresh and tasty.Ceviche of Shrimp - WOW! So authentic and on point. Me and my friend both said at the same time that the only thing missing was some tapatio! Stuffed Dates - Super tasty! The almonds inside give it the right amount of crunch to change up the consistency. Tierra & Mar Skewers - Everything was cooked really well (which i didn't really expect since they were all one one skewer). Chicken and Chorizzo stuffed mushrooms - bite size with a kick.Mac and Cheese - so good we had to order 2! Creamy and super tasty!I am sure there is way more stuff we ordered I just can't remember it and there were  a few things I didn't get to order that sounded good as well.They also sell mojitos by the PITCHER! The mojitos were good and not too stiff. Service was pretty quick once one plate came out they alls tarted to fill up the table quick. Everyone seemed pretty happy with the food.The prices are pretty reasonable adn they have something for just about everybody on their menu.
4	Came to Vegas for a bachelorette party with 7 girls and needed a pre-club dinner location. Firefly came highly recommend by a few locals as a great destination, so we decided to check it out. A few weeks prior to the event, I worked with Regina and Araceli to secure a reservation. Both of these ladies were awesome and extremely quick in their e-mail responses. I had a few  last minute changes to the # of attendees and they were super accommodating. In order to secure a Saturday night reservation, we were required to meet a $35 food / beverage minimum per person (not including tax / tip). The restaurant contacted me the morning of to reconfirm and see if there were any changes. When we arrived @ 8:30pm, I checked-in and had to sign an agreement guaranteeing we'd meet the minimum. Once the document was signed we were immediately seated. The line/wait outside looked ridic! I was was glad the reservation process was so seamless. The menu is extensive and a little overwhelming. Our waiter was helpful and made a few suggestions of the most popular dishes. I basically told him to start pumping everything out! Once we gave him the green light it felt like the plates never stopped coming:)  I'm allergic to shellfish, so I wasn't able to partake in all of the seafood dishes. Here are a few of my favs: Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates w/Bleu Cheese: I'm not a huge fan of bacon or dates - however these little things are addictive. The bacon is perfectly cooked with just the right amount of fat and crisp. The Bleu cheese and the smoked almond give it just the right amount sweetness and crunch. I ended up eating about 3 of them - the flavor is pretty rich, I couldn't imagine eating more. lol Roast Pork Empanada: You can never go wrong with Empanadas - nice flaky crust - a little on the salty side but still good.  Stuffed Mushrooms - Chicken and Chorizzo: One of my favorite selections - Delish! Mac N Cheese: Cheesy and awesome with a bread crumb-esq crust. Our table polished off the first dish and immediately placed another order. Tuna Tartare: Great flavor - fresh and everyone seemed to like it. I literally could have eaten the entire plate by myself. Drinks are solid and the Mojito's are pretty damn tasty - we ordered 2 pitchers for the table to share. We also ordered a few other drinks from the bar which were OK. Best bet is to stick to the Mojito's and Sangria (light ice).
4	Came in from out of town for a work convention, food was good enough to justify going two days in a row. Food was great, portions were very well proportion volume / price. Place is busy and be sure to arrive plenty in advance to get seated since they do not take reservations.
3	Okay so I totally get why this place is so popular, its cheap, fast and mostly easy aside form the long waits. We've never waited before as we use opentable for a reservations which takes away the hassle of standing around outside and being hounded by panhandlers. Anyways.. service is pretty tight and the dishes come out really fast so if you're looking to relax while you're dining you'll need to let your server know that you are in no rush. While perusing the menu we ordered a whole pitcher of their tasty sangria, a must. If you don't like wine they also have a full bar though their beer selection kind of sucks all the same bottles everyone else serves. Very disappointing. The menu is pretty huge with a little something for everyone. Our server recommended 2-4 plates per person though we totally over ordered, 4 plates each was a little to much for the 3 of us. Below is the laundry list of dishes we order along with quick comments. +Tomato bread is chewy bread topped with tomatoes though the juice of the tomato along with salt and vinegar has soaked into the bread making it really moist and flavorful. Loved it.-Artichoke toasts.. to be honest I don't even really remember eating these. I guess that would mean they were just alright. +Sausage plate was one of my favorites. Thin slices of various cured Spanish sausages along with mustard, pickles, olives etc.. +Tuna tartare was huge and for the price a great value. Super fresh tasting with a light seasoning just enough to enhance the flavor of the fish. Winner winner!  Stuffed dates are addictive and their bacon wrapped version packs a whole lot flavor into one tiny bite.-Baked tetilla was alright, melted cheese really. There are better things to order.+Manchego Mac n cheese was pretty good. Nice and gooey with a decent crust. -Thai beef salad was the weakest dish. I'd say its more like Thai light as there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor from the beef or the dressing. I wouldn't order this salad again.+Pulpo asado, grilled octopus, was slightly chewy but had a decent amount of flavor. -Chicken and chorizo stuff mushrooms were insanely hot temperature wise, be warned. I thought they were just okay but probably wouldn't order these again either. -Ham and cheese croquetas had a good texture but not as tasty as one might imagine.  They needed dipping sauce.+Filet mignon sliders were pretty good though I wished that they came out hotter. +Baby back ribs were pretty awesome, sticky, porky meaty and satisfying. So over all a good time with lots of tasty bites. Definitely great for either a light meal or like we had, a serious tapas feast. Be sure to make your reservations ahead of time!
4	not usually a big fan of tapas since the plates make me feel like a giant, but this place is the perfect place for both locals and tourists alike. that means it can get really crowded! the food is really good; good bold, flavors and well balanced - not overly salty, spicy or sweet. since it gets crowded, it does affect the service, but our server did good job as did our hostess. and since the restaurant is in an outside shopping center, parking can be an issue. but if you're stick of the buffets and high-end hotel restaurants, this is a solid choice.
5	Came with a group of 6ish while at convention, we shared numerous plates and all left satisfied and happy for around $100 total which is fantastic in Vegas and for being right behind the strip. Ambiance was warm and intimate. There is a bit of a wait, seems to be a popular place, however, a bar is conveniently located a couple doors down which we took advantage of while waiting.  Raved about the place to fellow conference attendees encouraging them to check it out. We had too many dishes to recall, however, we were not disappointed with any of them. Will make it back next time in town.
3	We wanted the outdoor seating because we were escaping the cold-weather and wanted to enjoy the 75 degree weather.  The street noise was loud and you have a wonderful view of - a parking lot.  If you are thinking 'fine dining' and want the atmosphere to match the qualify of some of the food, the patio may not be for you, and may not be worth the wait.The stuffed dates were quite good and 'Tierra y mar' was also a highlight among the 10 items we ordered. Our second round/course (the final three items) was forgotten under the heatlamps, so they were terrible really, absolutely ruined the cheese in one of the dishes.Careful: the servings are small so if you are hungry you will be ordering many of them... and they add up.
2	I give this place a 5 star for food, but 1 star for service. We ordered 4 different tapas, as well as alcoholic beverages. The Sparkling Sangria was nice, lots of fresh fruit inside.  The stuffed dates are a must. Tuna Peppers were quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fish sticks were delicious with a nice sauce for dipping.  And the Lamb Skewers were also very good, cooked to perfection.  However, once the waiter dropped off our food, he never checked in on us again. I expect a waiter to come by within at least 10 minutes of getting your food.  If he had, we would have ended up ordering another order of the stuffed dates, as well as another round or two of drinks.  But instead, 20 minutes after dropping off our food, we had to flag him down just to get our check.  It was not busy inside at all, so there was really no excuse for such crap service.  He had 0 personality, which was surprising considering his very exciting hair. But like I said, the food was amazing, but our waiter ruined the whole experience.  I would come back, as long as I don't have him again.
5	This place is fantastic!Do yourself a favor and reserve a table ahead of time.I went on a Wednesday night and there was a 30 minute wait. I can only assume this place is packed every night. Luckily, since I had reserved a table I was seated right away.Pretty loud and super casual, lots of great menu options.I'll definitely be back the next time i'm in Vegas.
4	This place is always packed so I recommend making a reservation. Although its worth the wait if you don't make one too. Their red sangria is so good! But i also like the white, it's refreshing on a warm Vegas day. My fave tapas are the bacon wrapped dates and the tuna peppers, gotta try them if you go!
4	Very good! Tuna tar tar, shrimp civechi, Lamb chops, and mushrooms! Everything was fantastic!
5	I love it here!  Great concept.  Small plates and priced reasonably. We looked at the pics that other Yelpers had graciously posted and began our tasting session...  My party of 5 loved everything we ordered.  I recommend you try their paella!Firefly is on a short list of restaurants in Vegas where I will definitely return for repeat visits.Deservedly so, Firefly was a Reader's Choice selection in the BestofVegas.com awards for 2013.
5	Bacon Wrapped Dates!!!! Magic in ones mouth! Lamb Chops are also amazing, actually everything on the menu is amazing. You have to go with a group because you have to order most of the menu and have a bite of everything!
5	This is truely a fantastic place.  The tapas are outstanding, the wine reasonbly priced.  What has always amazed me is the variety of tapas they offer.  I am always thankful when I am staying up the street at a convention center hotel so that I can walk a few blocks to hit up this gem.  Unfortunately, it seems to ALWAYS be crowded - but that is justifiable if you read the ratings.  Even though I am staying further out this next trip I am going to gladly make the drive to get dinner there.  Almost always room for a single traveler at the bar.This is one of the best */$ values in Las Vegas.
2	See those 2 stars up there? They serve as a reminder that no matter how good your food is, if the service blows then you've lost me as a customer forever. Came here mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, when it was lively but not exactly crowded. Our waiter, a diminutive Mexican with a thick accent and leopard mohawk which belied personality, came by to take our drink orders. I went with a traditional mojito and my gf got a sangria. Once they were dropped off, he came back to take our food order. We wanted to sample a lot, so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, tuna peppers, lamb skewers, and fish sticks. Man, everything was awesome!My mojito was perfectly prepared. The bacon wrapped dates are astoundingly good. They're small, but each one packs a serious flavor punch. Tuna peppers were light & refreshing, with a slight kick. The fish sticks had a tasty sauce accompany them, but otherwise I wasn't overly impressed. But the lamb skewers rocked, and they came with a side of... ah, geez... it was either couscous or quinoa. It was great. Everything was so great, in fact, that we were dying to order more. But our waiter was MIA. I scanned the place for him - nada. The few times I did see him, he showcased his learned skills in the art of "how to not make eye contact with customers". After around 10-15 of this shtick, I gave up. Finally, I flagged down a busboy and asked for the check. Then our waiter magically appears with the check and asks me if I want dessert. You're joking, right? I told him no and handed him my card, since I didn't feel like waiting to see when he'd show up to collect my payment. He returned it quickly with a muttered "thank you" that sounded like someone forced him at gunpoint to say it. I gave him around a 6% tip, which my dad later told me should've been ZERO. Per his wisdom, a low tip only makes you look cheap, but no tip says "fuck you, you suck". Should've gone zero. I might return here - the food was so damn good I could make my mouth water just thinking about it, but the shit service had me so hopping mad after we finished that I couldn't wait to jet out of there. If you're a manager, tell the mohawked server to grow a personality commensurate with his hairstyle. You lost more of my money because of him, and I've got a sneaking suspicion I'm not the only one.
5	Perfect place for tapas!   This appears to be a locals favorite, and I can see why after our visit.  Fun place to sample several moderately priced tapas that are all VERY VERY good + some mighty tasty Sangria.  Superb service.  Added bonus -  B tribe blasting from the speakers!
4	Food was excellent. Had to wait at times for the waitress. Overall fantastic experience. Good ambiance. A little loud, part of the charm.
2	2 stars for this location, 4 stars for other locations. Fireflies is the best tapas place but service, portion and quality do vary between locations.Summerlin has the best vibe, great portions, good service, Anthem has great service, decent portions and beautiful view. This Paradise location's service ranks last. Our server did not bother to check on us once, refill a water glass or even come around to bring us the bill. The bacon stuffed dates came out with raw fatty bacon, we had to flag down the server & ask him to please cook them more. He came back with burnt black bacon :/ Fortunately we had a very nice buser that did all the work and helped salvage our experience. The artichoke toasts were on crouton sized toast and hardly any garlic sauce, the tuna tartare taro chips were hard & undercooked. And pasta was drowning in tomato paste. Sad how poor management can ruin a location. I think this location was also featured on one of those restaurant stakeout episodes and didn't do too well. Guess they didn't learn much from that experience.
5	Best tapas place I've been to. Was recommended by a friend who lives in Vegas. Sangria smooth and tapas so good. Can't wait to go again
4	Great place- food was excellent, for the most part. Favorites were the Ahi Tuna skewer, lamb skewer, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms and stuffed dates. Also loved the bread pudding and chocolate tres leches for dessert. Service was also great. Only complaint is the nose level was quite high. Otherwise a great place.
5	Got a mojito pitcher with my girls for happy hour and had a great time!From what I can remember everything was so tasty and the waiters were hilarious. Don't know if it was the drunkeness or if everything was really that great! I vaguely remember something made with bacon and dates that was amazing. I don't even like bacon like that.I think this has to be my most useless review ever but this place definitely gets 5 stars. :) food, drinks, service, ambiance, all were great. Next time I'm in Vegas I need to take better notes when I'm here.I wish there was one of these in LA. I'd be there everyday with a mojito pitcher . Lol alcoholic...
5	We tried to get a reservation but they were booked, but we decided to try our luck at the door. We waited a good half hour, but it was totally worth it!We started with a pitcher of their red sangria. $28 and two of us couldn't finish it, and we love Sangria! They marinate it for 3 days and it's delicious, full of apples but not too sweet. Great bargain, easily good for 3 people!We ordered a variety of plates, all of which were reasonably priced and delicious!Apple and Manchego Salad - $4.00. Really different, with tiny strips of apples and manchego cheese, with a light dressing and a hint of almonds. Not like anything else I've ever had. 5 stars!Tuna Tartare - $8.00. A nice portion with an unusual taste. I found it light and pleasant, and I normally don't enjoy any type of raw fish at all. 5 stars.Mushroom Tart - $7.50. Light pastry with mushrooms and boursin cheese and some sort of sauce that was delightful. Thoroughly enjoyed. 4 stars.Baked Tetilla - $8.00. A cheese fondue type dish with tomoatoes and toast. It was good, although probably my least favorite dish of the night. Nothing special, but certainly not bad. 4 stars.Ham & Cheese Croquettas - $5.00. 3 small but delicious croquettas that we totally inhaled. Absolutely a must! 5 stars.Steak & Mushroom Skewers - $8.50. Absolutely heavenly. Tender steak, huge mushrooms, and an amazing creamy red wine sauce that just melted in your mouth. AWESOME! 5 stars.Dessert Platter - $12.00. We had flan, passion fruit cheesecake, chocolate tres leches and lemon-berry tarts. The flan was delightful--light and caramely and flavorful. The passion fruit cheesecake was really different, a hint of the fruit and lots of cream! chocolate tres leches is definitely not my thing, although my dining partner liked it--I thought the chocolate took away from the dish (least favorite thing I ate all night). Lemon-berry tarts were wonderful! Light and tart and creamy! good value!We heard about this place from a waiter on the STrip who said this is where locals eat--you need to eat here!
4	4 1/2 stars. Came here about 8pm on a Sunday night. There were a handful of people waiting and although the hostess said it'd be a 20-25 min wait for our party of two, we got seated in 10 min! Several different dining areas- outside, the main inside, and another inside dining area adjacent to the main one accessible from a separate entrance. The interior was nice and somewhat dark, good for a date or even a large party.  The mojito i ordered was really really good! I could've easily downed several although I kept it to one. I tried the red sangria which was good too but very light, almost watered down. We tried several of the waiter's suggestions- the stuffed dates (SOOO good), and the Tierra y mar (Shrimp, filet, sausage skewers) which was also good but not to die for.  The Tuna tartare was really really good! But the Grilled octopus was not what I expected. But I prefer raw over cooked octopus and I had the whole plate to myself which was even more unpalatable. The Petite filet was very good and the Fish sticks were so good and crunchy and meaty n tender on the inside. 6 tapas and the 2 drinks for $65. I would definitely return.
3	I eaten at this firefly 3 times and still don't really understand the buzz over it.  All the food items i've tried are very decent tasting.  But i'd say the portions are too small in relation to the prices.  I would need to spend about 50 or 60 bucks to satisfy my appetite here.  I do love the outside deck and eating/drinking in the fresh springtime weather.  I'd recommend this place for drinks and snacks or if you want a small meal.
4	The locals and tourists love this place.You can be sure it will be jumpin on Friday/Saturday evenings, The House drink is Sangria, red or white marinated and thirst quenching, then they have more tapas than you can count, but the fave for me was the dates filled with Blue cheese and a smoked almond wrapped in bacon. There are warm and cold dishes, I would avoid the more expensive $ 10 meat and seafood dishes, they mostly did not live up to expectations. The simple dishes worked best for us. Service is average friendly but frenzied, drinks are made well if a bit small. This is a great place for groups or couples , not so much for singles though.There is an outdoor patio too. We saw at least 3 groups of 8 or more. You will have a authentic local experience here. It's a great place to start or end your evening. When you are done, in the same little mall is the Havana Cigar bar, you can stroll in for a nightcap and some live local entertainment.
5	Delicious! And, despite other reviews complaining about the service, our server seemed stressed, but was still friendly and attentive.We had the delicious bacon wrapped dates, lamb skewers, surf and turf skewers, veggie empanadas (amazing!), salmon toasts, steak salad (surprisingly, one of my favorites. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection, and complemented the salad very well). My mom had a sangria, which was very nice. I admit I stole a few (or more) sips! All in all, we ended up getting just enough food for 4 people, and left totally satisfied by all the flavors and textures, without being "vegas buffet stuffed".
5	OMG!!!!!!!!!! Could this restaurant be in Portland please!!!!! I guess I would be in some serious trouble if it was!My friend who is a regular took us here for lunch on my last day in Vegas, I could have seriously eaten there  every day! We had several plates...two different steak skewers-steak and mushroom and one with a green sauce, the figs (could have had these keep coming), croquettas-ham and cheese and meatballs. It was all amazing!!!!!!!!! Even the bread and almond butter you get when you sit down.We all had a different mojioto- blood orange, raspberry, and mango! All yummy!My only complaint is that it isn't in Portland, Oregon.So do you deliver? ;)
3	Food was ok. Pallea had shell fish that wasn't properly cleaned...got a bit of sand and one of the giant shrimps still had most of its vein...yucky. The service and callamary was great. Red sangria was great also!
4	Aside from Jaleo, this is another amazing place for tapas. Unlike Jaleo however, this place is more casual (scratch that, VERY casual) thus the price is also lower. I still prefer Jaleo due to the distance and the ratio of GREAT dishes vs  GOOD dishes is slightly higher at Jaleo's. However, I will be back for the spicy prawns dish which was divine!!
4	our servers name was carlos he was really nice, it was my first time! really like the calamari and the shrimp tempura :) NEED TO TRY MORE! prob going next week
3	Hmm...I'm not sure where to begin here. Let's try some sandwich management (no pun intended) - positive, negative, positive.Positive - The food was great and so were the prices.  I'd say the pricing for the quality and portion size of food was really right on.  Had the Pulpo Asado (octopus), Filet Sliders, Podrano Peppers, and a few other things - all great.  Negative - The sangria is SUPER overrated.  My boyfriend and I had almost pitchers and we were stone cold sober afterwards.  It was just a LOT of juice and not much else...not impressed, especially for an "authentic" tapas place.  I should also mention that in general, I really love Sangria, so this was a big disappointment.  Also - the bacon-wrapped dates? I mean, they were good, but not amazing - I've had better.Positive - The bartender was super sweet and I really liked the vibe.I'll definitely be back, but next time, no sangria.
4	Pretty darn good Tapas place in Vegas. The boyfriend and I arrived in Vegas around noon on a Tuesday and decided to have lunch here. There was no wait and we were seated. A few of what we had: Passion Fruit Mojito: I looooove passion fruit mojitos and Firefly makes pretty good passion fruit mojitos. Blood orange mojito is also good but I prefer passion fruit.Patatas Bravas- potatoes with spicy aioli. Pretty good. I'm a potato lover and I've bad better BUT for this restaurant, I'll definitely order it again.Firefly Fries- I'd skip on this next time and order the patatas bravas instead. Camarones al ajillo- shrimp with lemon garlic butter. Loved this dish that I ordered two. I'm a shrimp lover and this wasn't THE BEST shrimp I've ever had but its pretty darn close.Stuffed Dates- boyfriend ordered this and he loved it.Empanada- boyfriend also ordered this and he looooved it.Since this restaurant is tapas, small plates = must buy more. Which really means buy everything hahaha. We ended up ordering more than we needed to and when we do go back (we most likely will), we will probably order what I had stated above (we actually had tons more but they weren't worth mentioning). I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
1	FOOD POISONINGI hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.
1	1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.
1	I ate there on April 25, the day before the board of health shut it down for 3 dozen cases of food poisoning. I choose firefly based on the comments on Yelp. From NY, and now back home and suffering from food poisoning from their cheap and bad food. Be warned, if they open again. What happens in Vegas does not stay there.
1	I type this in my hospital bed so I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. I as ate here 4/23/12 with about 5 other friends from out of town to show off how amazing this place is. And it was another great dining experience.... 72 hours later or less and I'm in a state of what seems to be nearing death.  And it seemed none of my friends were affected but they were/are. I just happened to get it the worst!! I've been a firefly customer for 5 years! Never have I gone through anything like this. I may never come back and never recommend this particular firefly toAnyone or anyone coming to visit Las Vegas... I'm still in shock this has happened.  Most expensive dining experience ever. Thanks a lot.*** also this was no food poisoning I got for all you dim witted fools that think otherwise. Salmonella feels like and is (currently) Hell. SALMONELLA
1	Well....I can tell you this...I have never eaten at this place...but was looking forward to.  As you know if you are staying in Vegas (i.e. not from Vegas)...and venture off the strip is somewhat cumbersome...even if only a few miles away.  Thankfully we had a car and didn't pay taxi fare.  Shame on me for not calling ahead for reservations...but we did go on the site 2-3 time when deciding on where to eat and this place had NO MENTION that they were going to be randomly closed for the night... a SATURDAY NO LESS (4/27/13)????  WTF?  Obviously this isn't a case of dumb ass tourists either as we were there around 8PM for 10 minutes and no less than half a dozen other cars (with Nevada plates) drove up with the same reaction.  It is close to the strip...though on the other side from where we were staying...but seriously guys...Yelpers seem to love you...but POST ON YOUR SITE IF YOU"RE CLOSED....dont leave a 8 1/2 by 11 sheet outside your business saying you're sorry but will be closed today!
1	I got Salmonella poisoning from here. We ate there last Wednesday 4/23/13. Thought this was a nice place. Went to VegAs for my birthday and had dinner with 6 of my friends and every one of us got salmonella poisoning. One of my friends was hospitalized for 5 days. Ruined my trip, my birthday and now I can't pay rent because I've had to call into work the last 5 days. Thanks a lot I will never ever go here again.
5	WOW!  This place was very good.  I got the paella and really enjoyed.  I also liked the mussels.  The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  This was trul
5	Vegas peeps who are paying way too much for subpar food on the strip, this is the place you need to come.  Great food from a chef who helped start mon ami gabi.  Tapas were fantastic as was the sangria, which they marinate for three days to really meld the flavors.  Its not really walkable from anywhere but it isn't a far cab ride either.Edit: Although this was posted on 5/5, I ate there a few months ago...looks like they are having sanitation problems and were/are temporarily closed http://tinyurl.com/bvdtw74
5	Their Sangria was amazing! I tasted both the red and the white Sangria and it is the best that I have had by far. Get a pitcher, it is only $28 and worth every dollar.Now with the food: I had the tuna tartare, bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, ceviche, sliders, and manchego mac n' cheese. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. The highlights: The tuna tasted a bit like hawaiian poke with avocado and it paired perfectly with the taro chips, I ordered 2 of these plates (they were that good). Everyone talks about the stuffed dates, and they are amazing; perfect blend between savory and sweet with a nice blue cheese kick. The mac n' cheese was so creamy and was not overwhelmingly rich.Firefly has such a high rating for a reason!
5	Bring 8 people and order one of everything on the menu, I have....you will not be disappointed. Get in early or make a reservation.
1	with the recent salmonella outbreak i don't know if i will ever go back ... i didn't find the little bit of food i did try to be very good anyhow... sorry just not a big fan ... their mojitos aren't bad
1	Never Again!This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!
3	Food was quite good here, service was ok but nothing special. We got stuck in the drafty porch corner and seemed to get overlooked by servers a lot so it took awhile to get drinks. I'd give it another shot though next time i'm in Las Vegas.
1	Didn't review when I ate there and felt ill. Who knows? I might have been sliding downhill before I went to dinner...so I didn't want to unfairly hang it on them. But now...hmmm. I am sure they will undergo a thorough review before they reopen.
5	A local suggested this to me and I can see why!  I loved this place and I will be back next time I am in Vegas.  I was seated right away.  The waiter suggested the stuffed dates.  I was a little leary, but they were awesome!  Everything else was delicious and the prices cannot be beat.  Service was excellent too.  Watch out for the Sangria - delicious, but it sneaks up on you :)
1	Closed by Health Department because of salmonella outbreak.
1	My wife is pregnant and we were on our babymoon in Vegas for a week. We had a great time and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, but I need to give this a 1 start given that if we had eaten a week later, this salmonella outbreak could have caused immeasurable harm to our child.
4	Located in a strip mall.. We visited the Firefly for my sister's Bachelorette dinner before hittin the town.. good thing we had reservations because this place was packed.   Good SIGN!Their specialty here is tapas/small plates so we ordered a bunch of different items recommended by the waitress and just shared everything.  They have so many different items to please any palette.  They also serve nice yummy mojitos by the pitcher. Needless to say that was a hit with the entire group!  Items ordered:  Ceviche Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Empanadas, Tuna Tartar, Mac & Cheese, Chicken & Chorizo Mushrooms and a few other items.  Everything was pretty tasty especially my favorite mac & cheese.  We had to get double of that!Everyone was pleased with the meal and got their fill... ready for a night on the town!
5	Outstanding!!! Service excellent. Food excellent. Had a Mojito pitcher, paella, filet mignon sliders, stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and a bunch of others. All the food was great, and reasonably priced! Must visit when in Vegas!
1	The sliders are delicious, but ask them to please hold the Salmonella
1	This place used to be one of my favorites! But guess what? I was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning. Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo.  Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight.  The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya! I wish I could recommend this place, but my advice is: EAT THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
3	We came to Firefly to celebrate my fiance's birthday while on a one-night trip to Vegas.  It was my first time at this type of restaurant.  We started off with the sparking sangria, and proceeded to order half of the menu to share among 4 people.  The food was great, but service was a bit slow.  The server didn't offer any recommendations, which seemed odd since the menu is long, and it's a popular place.Unfortunately, 50% of our party came down with salmonella poisoning a day later.  My fiance was very ill for 10 days and lost over 14 pounds.  I was lucky, and didn't get sick.  We aren't sure why, but I didn't have any of the seafood dishes, so perhaps it was something there.  The food was great, so it's disappointing that their standard of cleanliness with their food preparation is so low.
5	Reviews were great and Firefly didn't disappoint.  Everything we tried was fantastic. Loud but lively atmosphere. Wait was close to an hour but we spent the wait at the nearby cigar bar.  Must try!!
5	I ate at Firefly during all this hoopla of salmonella. Before everyone gets up in arms and judgey about my liking this place so much, I don't care. Humans are disgusting animals, and sometimes careless animals who let their food go bad. Whoops! Since I have lived in Vegas, I have been wanting to try this place. I'm proud to report that I did--also super proud that I didn't get sick off this place. Nothing short of a fantastic meal was had by me--even if others did not, sadly.My mom and I ordered five or six small plates. The standouts were manchego mac and cheese (super bomb, I would eat this in a sandwich or on top of a pizza), the bacon wrapped dates (blue cheese to die for) and the mushroom tarte (I'm so sad I spent so much of my life hating mushrooms. They're delicious!). I would order of these again. Not so much on the duck confit egg roll--it was weird and the sauce was too sweet. The service was attentive as could be--the place was packed on a Thursday night at 9pm. The reviews and the patronage don't lie--this place is good. Sucks that they were careless enough to not look for salmonella on the eve of their relocation. I hope that Firefly can recover from this really, really bad PR. I've said it before--I'm going back and I look forward to seeing how they change it up!
1	This place has really gone down hill, I hope they reopen with a better quality and brand.
3	I ate here twice while visiting Las Vegas in Spring 2013 at the recommendation of my friends who live locally. I enjoyed the food and drinks. But when I went to post my review, I read about the food poisoning incident which closed the place. So i downgraded my rating from a 4 star to 3 star. I hope they find the source of the salmonella and correct the problem. Not good.
4	Had dinner recently at the newly re-opened Firefly on Paradise. The restaurant was spotless. The new bathrooms were bigger and clean, Food was excellent. They added 2 new items, would have loved a few more new bites but the spicy chicken empanadas were yummy. The mussels are still my absolute fav and the mushroom tart was delicious!!! Honestly, right now and for the next year at least... it's probably the safest and cleanest resturaunt in Vegas. Highly recommend to all!!!
5	Wow. Service is fantastic.  Food is so fun and delicious.  Tapas satisfy all desires.
5	I went to eat here with a few friends. I love tapas and this place had a great selection and atmosphere. I loved the bacon wrapped dates and the caramel flan the best! The flan was so good,we ordered another. Definitely want to eat there again when I visit Vegas next time.
4	I asked a friend to take me to somewhere the locals go - I was tired of eating in the casinos, and this is where they brought me.Just off the strip. Great, flavorful tapas.  Pitchers of Sangria.  This place is great.  Chorizo and Clams, and Bacon wrapped Dates are two of the dishes we had, that I will remember for a long long time...I look forward to coming back...
1	My wife was one of the victims of the salmonella poisoning and has been in  and out of the hospitalized twice and now we are in the emergency room for the second time. In addition to the poisoning she also came down with C Diff!  The owners only care about their reputation and not about the 300 people they made sick and how this has affected our lives. So MAD they they opened up this restaurant again!!  DON'T EAT HERE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
5	Ate here on Saturday for my sister's bachelorette. The place looks pretty swanky with these crazy red chandeliers, perfect for a bachelorette party! There was even a wedding reception going on in one of the rooms. When we arrived, we decided to split up the orders for our table of 8 into 4 and 4 so it would be easier to eat and share the plates. After ordering, the manager? came up and asked us if we wanted to order off the menu or the package menu (all you can eat/drink for $55/pp). We stuck with our order, but she still offered us a round of shots, strawberry vodka with cranberry for the girls and a blow job shot for the bride. Awesome!! Then another guy came up to the table and asked the bride if he could fill the champagne flute that she brought with her from the hotel, of course she accepted... free alcohol. He brought over a mini bottle of champagne (which unfortunately might have gone bad already) still Awesome. Overall food was great. I totally recommend the mushroom tarts and the chicken and mushroom paella was pretty good too. Overall if you are celebrating something, esp a bachelorette, this is a great place to go.
5	Saba Man and I stopped in here while on a recent visit to Las Vegas.  The. Best. Small plates that don't disappoint;  boasts international flavors along with more familiar fare. A short distance off the strip but well worth it.*posted photos of some of our order  the ahi poke, empanadas , dessert
3	Remember your first crush? The one you had as a kid and you fondly look back on it with nothing but good memories? Well Firefly is that to me. This is the place that introduced me to the world of tapas. Years have passed since my first trip here and I have consumed and experienced my fair share of tapas around the world. Some better and some worse than Firefly, but there will always be a little love for the place that started it all. I try to visit once every time I am in Vegas but with the popularity of tapas and small plate restaurants in general growing, there are now incredible tapas restaurants all over the country and the absolute high regard I had for the food here isnt there anymore. Unfortunately this location was recently shut down due to a Salmonella outbreak. We actually dined there in early March and luckily didnt get sick. I hope they get their stuff together and open up again since this was one of the most popular restaurants in town.
1	Food poisoning.  You know its bad when you call the restaurant to complain, and the board of health calls you back.
5	We ordered Mac n' cheese, empanadas and Serrano Sliders. ALL of it was amazing. Our service was top grade. Our waiter was extremely helpful and all smiles. The busboy was on top of everything. Drinks were re-filled even before they were empty, trash and plates were cleared in a matter of seconds. AMAZING place. I'd highly recommend it and would definitely make my way back again when I'm in town.
5	Love love their Sangria and tapas. The place is the go to when you come to Vegas.I have been coming here almost every time I'm in Vegas and have yet to get disappointed. Wait time can be insane but its will worth the wait. Perfect environment to mingle, bring a date, have a girls night out or anything you can think of.The last time I came here was last year, Yes - VERY late review but always better late than never. Been craving for their jambalaya and sangria, not to mention I will be purchasing my flight to go satisfy that craving - crossing fingers its still just as good as I remembered.
5	Absolutely LOVE this place. Fabulous food, fabulous service and fabulous ambiance. Tasty sangria drinks, the white sangria was especially good because it wasn't too sweet. Ordered the crispy duck, surf and turf skewerers, camarones all ajillo, bacon wrapped dates, ahi tuna with mango, ham and cheese croquettes and every single tapas dish was delightful! Only complaint is that it was a bit dark in the restaurant so we couldn't really see what we were eating.
5	Amazing tapas!! The filet mignon sliders are extremely tender and perfectly cooked; I could eat 100 of them
5	I was brought here by my friends who are locals. This is hands down some of the best food I've ever had! Everyone must try this place. It's about one mile off the strip, so everyone should be able to reach it.I have traveled around Spain and also regularly eat at Spanish restaurants across Southern California, and I have to say, I expected to find the typically understated and demure, simple and clean tapas I'm used to. Not So! This is bold and flavorful. It's Innovative, it's creative, it's Spanish fusion.The Food Style:This is gourmet at at an affordable price. IMHO the chef is a genius. Each small tapas plate is unique and individual, no two dishes are the same. Again, they are flavorful and bold, never bland. They display complex and contrasting flavors that are complimentary and blend seamlessly together to form a cohesive unit. Because each tapas plate is a small bite, the three of us were able to try 9 plates + 3 free bread and olive plates (The honey-almond-butter is amazing). This meal was like an amusement park for the taste buds.I don't eat much meat, so we stuck to seafood and vegetable dishes. It's great for vegetarians.My Favs (all 5 stars): The stuffed peppers, the roasted eggplant cannelloni, the manchego mac 'n' cheese, grilled scallops with saffron potato puree, and steamed mussels (incredible sauce). They give you as much free bread with honey-almond-butter and olives as you want. My friends raved about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, which are arguably the most popular item on the menu (I don't eat bacon).Others (4 stars): Tortilla espaniola, patatas bravas (great brava sauce).To Drink: A pitcher of Red Sangria. This is the real deal and very very tasty. It tastes like a fruity Merlot, not like some frou-frou fake sangria cocktail you get at chain restaurant.NOTE: some tapas are better than others, but you have to be adventurous and start trying. Use the tips above. The only one I wouldn't order again was the seared ahi tuna skewers. They didn't have much flavor and the texture a little too tough to chew.Ambience: somewhat dark and intimate, warm decor, comfy booths. Service: Excellent. very friendly and attentive. They easily accommodate special requests.Prices: $35 per person after tip per person for 9 plates and a big pitcher of sangria, and we were all STUFFED. PROS: The Amazing Gourmet Food; great for vegetarians; affordable prices; delicious sangria; comfy booths;  great service too; close to the Strip (about 1 mile)CONS: NONEBOTTOM LINE: Come here, or you're missing out! I would consider driving back to Vegas from LA to eat here.
5	Love this place. Good food, fun atmosphere.
4	Firefly never disappoints! Great food (stuffed dates, apple manchago salad and of course sangria are always a must-order) and even their olive and bread starter has that delicious sweet/tangy butter. Great for a first date or friends from work! Love the decor and the ambiance.  Service could be better, a couple times I've gone I felt like I waited forever for the server to come and ask if we wanted to order anything else.  And aside from all the negative comments and health history, I've always found Firefly to be delicious and I have full faith that they revamped their standards!
5	I'm a huge fan of tapas & this is one of my favorite restaurants ever. My only complaints are it's a little loud & crowded.
1	Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me twice (and make me barf)? So I decided to give this place another chance back on my friend's birthday. The food ranged from really good (the bacon--wrapped figs) to meh. The service was as snooty as I remembered it. But the 1-star (I'd give it zero if I could) is for the FOOD POISONING I got from this dump that had me hurling for two days straight. This was about a month or so before Salmonella-Gate last year, which certainly explains a lot. I will never understand the amount of hype and praise this restaurant gets from foodies in this town.
5	Amazing food at inexpensive prices.
5	Consistently great quality.... Especially love the one on Paradise! Great selection of tapas and awesome sparkling sangria!
4	Excellent food. The dates were amazing and the iberico ham was above average. Still far from great iberico but good enough. The gazpacho surprised me. Almost like my grandmothers. Their specialty fries ok, nothing special. Service is a bit lax but pleasant. Great price for the food.
5	Summary: Food is crazy good! Service is fast! Environment isn't too bad either.Food:  Are you kidding me? Literally everything that comes out of this kitchen is great! Great attention to detail. Service: Pretty good service. Nothing extremely unusual about the service, except that it is fast!Environment: Environment is alright. It hasn't been consistent the two times that I've been so I can't comment too much. This place is getting a 5 star because the food is unreal!
2	Awe man, I used to eat here consistently for a solid 3 years. The health code fiasco wasn't something they ever recovered from. Plus they messed it up twice now. Great job guys! Not my go to anymore, sadly enough. They opened up a Taco joint where they used to be. Not bad! Worth checking out.
5	My husband and I go to Firefly at least twice a week and this place is always hoppin!  We usually sit at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table and there is a steady stream of great people watching.  I love the tapas style menu because we can order several plates and just share.  The bread and butter spread they bring is super yummy.A few of my personal favorites from the menu:bacon wrapped dates!!!tomato soup and grill cheesepupusa (octopus) this is divineslidersroasted peppersempenadasgoat cheese and beet saladfriesThey also serve a very tasty infused fruit vodka and the service is always friendly and fast.Awesome low prices, especially for the quality and hoppin atmosphere.  I would especially recommend this to tourists, however I'd like to keep it as a secret gem for us locals!
